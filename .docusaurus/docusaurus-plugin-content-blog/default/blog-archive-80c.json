With the Push Snap installed, you can now seamlessly receive notifications powered by [Push Protocol](https://push.org/) directly into your wallet, ensuring you never miss out on important updates from the channels you subscribe to.\n\nBy delivering notifications directly to your wallet address, we’re eliminating the need to log in to any other front-end separately to get those same notifications and alerts. By bringing all your notifications into one place, we’re saving you time, effort, and allowing you to more easily stay connected and informed.\n\n## Core Snap Features\n\nThe main features of version 1 of the Push Snap include:\n\n1. <b>Notifications</b>: Notifying users of all updates from the channels they\n   opt-in to.\n2. <b>Address Selection</b>: Addition or removal of their desired addresses for\n   notifications.\n3. <b>Customization of Pop-Ups</b>: Push Snap allows users to toggle popup\n   notifications at their convenience.\n\n## Brief glance at the Push Snap’s working mechanism\n\n- The snap requests permission to run periodically every minute.\n- While running, it scouts for all new notifications/alerts received by your wallet\n- It then bundles all the notifications together and shows all of them in the form of a pop-up as well as in-app notification.\n- The Push Snap allows users to update their address for which they prefer to receive notifications.\n- The Push Snap also includes features to toggle the pop-up notifications as per the user’s choice.\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\n  Note: Currently, the Push Snap checks if more than 25 notifications are\n  received per minute. If that’s the case, the Push Snap automatically notifies\n  the user and snoozes the popups, which can always be turned back on from the\n  dApp.\n  </i>\n</blockquote>\n\n## Snap installation and Set-Up guide\n\n- If you don’t already have a MetaMask wallet, install and [set-up a wallet in MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask) here.\n- Next, go to [https://app.push.org/receive](https://app.push.org/receive)\n- Click on <b>Install Snap</b> → <i>approve the required permissions to run the snap</i>\n- Once successfully installed the snap will redirect to Push Channels Dapp\n- Here you can opt-in to your favourite channels to receive notifications\n- Once done, you can go back to the Snap Settings Page.\n- With the connected wallet, click on <b>Add Address:</b>\n- This allows you to add an address for which you prefer to receive notifications\n- Once you click, simply sign the message to complete the process\n- Once done, you are all set. The address will now start receiving notifications.\n\n## Snap’s permissions\n\n- <b>Local storage</b>: To store the addresses to send notifications and PGP\n  private key to send PUSH Chat notifications\n- <b>Periodic actions</b>: This includes sending notifications every minute to\n  the wallet\n- <b>Dialog Boxes</b>: This includes popups for showing notifications on screen\n  and the initial screen\n- <b>Internet Access</b>: The Push Snap has internet access and can make API\n  calls using fetch()\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\nMentioned below are the imperative calls made by the Push Snap.\n\n## onRPCHandler Specifications\n\n- <b>‘pushproto_addaddress’</b> — This stores the address in the local storage chosen\n  by the user after the signature is successful. This address will be served the\n  notifications.\n- <b>‘pushproto_removeaddress’</b> — This removes the address from the local storage\n  chosen by the user. That address won’t be served the notification anymore.\n- <b>‘pushproto_welcome’</b> — Serves as an initial popup to introduce the user to\n  what the snap does and redirects the user to <a href=\"https://app.push.org\">\n    app.push.org\n  </a> to opt-in to the push channels to start getting notifications.\n- <b>‘pushproto_togglepopup’</b> — This method turns off the snooze and notifications\n  would be allowed to be shown in the form of popups again.\n\n## onCronjob Handler Specifications\n\n- Check if the total notification received is >25. If not it continues to display notifications in the form of popups, otherwise it turns off popups notifying the user, and it can be toggled from the app\n- InApp notifications have a limit of 11 notifications per second since notifications could be sent every 5 sec, to adhere to that it’s limited to 11 latest notifications per second fired every 5 seconds, adding up to 55 secs, and the next 5-sec gap is freed for the next iteration\n\n## Trouble getting started? We’re here to help!\n\nIf you have any issues with setting up your Push Snap, we have a 24/7 dedicated team of devs to help you out.\n\nYou can find us here 👉https://discord.gg/pushprotocol\n\n## Other FAQs\n\n### How can I install the Push Snap?\n\nTo install the Push Protocol Snap, you need to go to our dApp, https://app.push.org/receive and click on the Receive Notifications section. From there, install the Push Snap by giving it the required permissions. After adding addresses, you’re all set to start receiving notifications.\n\n### Can I add an address that I do not own?\n\nThe addresses to receive notifications can be added only after signing a message, which proves the ownership of that address, hence un-owned addresses cannot be added\n\n### Can I opt for only in-app MetaMask notifications?\n\nYes, the Push Snap can run only on in-app notifications, to avail that, you need to go through the Push Snap settings in the Push dApp and turn off pop-up notifications.\n\n### Can I opt into channels using this Push Snap?\n\nOpting-in to channels can only be done using the Push Protocol dApp. The Push Snap is only for receiving and displaying these notifications.\n\n### Can the Push Snap sign and send transactions?\n\nNo, the Push Snap does not have access to the Ethereum provider nor the signer hence the Push Snap cannot initiate any kind of transaction that may or may not involve asset transfers.\n\n### Is there a way to minimize frequent notification pop-ups?\n\nThe Push Snap has an in-built feature to snooze frequent pop-up notifications. If you receive more than 25 notifications within 5 minutes, it automatically goes into snooze mode and notifications would only come in MetaMask. These settings can always be reset from the dApp.\n\n### What permissions do I need to provide while installing or using the Push Snap?\n\nThe only permissions required are:\n\n- Local storage access for the Push Snap to store details of notifications received and allowed addresses\n- Internet access to gather notifications from Push Protocol\n- Periodic running of services while the browser is active to check for latest notifications\n- Dialog box access to allow pop-up notifications\n\n### Can I add more than one wallet to receive notifications?\n\nYes, more than one wallet can be added to receive notifications:\n\n- Go to the Push Snap settings on the Push dApp\n- Connect the wallet you want to add\n- Click on <a>Add Address</a> button and sign a message\n- The address will be added to the snap to receive notifications\n\n### If I have more than one wallet added to the Push Snap, will I receive notifications for all of them?\n\nYes, every wallet you add will receive a notification.\n\n### Does the MetaMask Wallet need to be unlocked to receive notification?\n\nYes, the browser window needs to be active and MetaMask needs to be unlocked to start receiving notifications.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion.

Decentralized communication has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional centralized systems, offering numerous advantages such as censorship resistance, privacy, and enhanced security.\n\nThis blog post dives into decentralized communication’s different approaches and technologies, providing an intellectual and developer-focused comparison to help you understand the landscape better.\n\n## Centralized vs. Decentralized Communication: A Quick Reminder\n\n### Centralized Communication\n\nIn centralized communication systems, a single entity, such as a company or government, controls the infrastructure and data transmission. This control allows for efficient data routing and management but comes with significant drawbacks, such as the potential for censorship, surveillance, and data breaches.\n\n### Decentralized Communication\n\nDecentralized communication systems distribute control across multiple nodes or participants, ensuring no single entity has complete authority over the network. This approach offers numerous benefits, including increased privacy, security, and resistance to censorship.\n\n### Decentralized Communication Technologies\n\nVarious technologies and approaches have emerged in decentralized communication, each with unique characteristics and benefits. Below, we’ll explore some of the most prominent ones:\n\n### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks\n\nP2P networks are decentralized communication systems where each node, or user, connects directly to other nodes without intermediaries. These networks provide:\n\n- Increased privacy and censorship resistance.\n- Lower latency.\n- Reduced reliance on central servers.\n\nExamples: BitTorrent, WebRTC, and Signal\n\n### Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)\n\nDHTs are a decentralized distributed system that stores key-value pairs across multiple nodes. These tables enable efficient and scalable routing and storage of data in P2P networks while providing fault tolerance and redundancy.\n\n### Examples: Kademlia, Coral, and Chord\n\nBlockchain-based Communication\nBlockchain technology can be applied to decentralized communication to create secure, transparent, and tamper-proof channels. Blockchains can facilitate secure data storage and transmission and enable privacy-preserving features like zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation.\n\nExamples: Push Protocol\n\n### Mesh Networks\n\nMesh networks are decentralized communication systems where nodes relay messages through multiple paths to reach their destination. These networks provide increased resilience, fault tolerance, and scalability, making them ideal for use when a central infrastructure is unreliable or unavailable.\n\nExamples: FireChat, RightMesh, and Althea\n\n## Comparing Decentralized Communication Approaches\n\nWhen evaluating decentralized communication technologies, it’s essential to consider various factors such as latency, privacy, security, scalability, and the developer ecosystem.\n\n### Latency\n\nP2P networks and mesh networks generally offer lower latency than blockchain-based communication systems, as they do not require consensus mechanisms or the storage of data on-chain. However, DHTs can add latency due to their routing and lookup mechanisms.\n\n### Privacy and Security\n\nWith end-to-end encryption, blockchain-based communication and P2P networks provide strong privacy and security guarantees. Zero-knowledge proofs and other advanced cryptographic techniques can further enhance privacy in blockchain-based communication systems.\n\n### Scalability\n\nDHTs and P2P networks can provide a solution great scalability, as they can distribute data storage and routing across multiple nodes. However, they often require complex setups and can face certain limitations in terms of node discovery, persistence, and network consistency.\n\n### Developer Ecosystem\n\nWhen selecting a decentralized communication technology, consider the maturity and robustness of the developer ecosystem. Examine the available tools, libraries, and community support to ensure you can effectively build and maintain your decentralized communication application.\n\n## How Does Push Protocol Relate to Other Decentralized Communication Methods?\n\nPush Protocol is a comprehensive decentralized communication solution that combines the best aspects of P2P communication, blockchain-based messaging and distributed messaging platforms.\n\nIn light of the additional context provided, let’s dive deeper into how Push Protocol compares to other decentralized communication methods, keeping the unique features and characteristics of Push Protocol in mind.\n\n## Push Protocol as P2P Communication\n\nWhile Push Protocol is a form of P2P communication, it expands upon traditional P2P communication by integrating blockchain technology, smart contract interactions, and wallet-to-wallet communication. This combination allows Push Protocol to offer a more secure, decentralized, and user-centric communication experience tailored to the needs of the Web3 ecosystem.\n\n- <b>Channels and Opt-in</b>: Push Protocol enables communication channels,\n  which allow wallet addresses to opt in or subscribe to receive notifications.\n  This user-centric approach ensures that users only receive notifications they\n  are interested in, minimizing spam and unwanted messages.\n- <b>Decentralized Network of Push Nodes</b>: Push Protocol is maintained by a\n  decentralized network of Push Nodes, each having a specific role in validating\n  and delivering messages between wallet addresses. This architecture provides a\n  higher degree of redundancy and resiliency than traditional P2P networks.\n- <b>Encryption and Verification Proof</b>: Push Protocol uses PGP encryption to\n  secure messages and provides a Verification Proof mechanism for validating the\n  sender, the chain, and the content of messages. This ensures data integrity\n  and privacy, which may be lacking in traditional P2P communication systems.\n\n## Push Protocol and Blockchain-based Messaging\n\nWhile Push Protocol utilizes blockchain communication, it incorporates blockchain-based messaging elements, such as user addresses and cryptography for secure communication. However, Push Protocol goes beyond essential blockchain communication by supporting any network, not just blockchain and web3, enabling more extensive interoperability and flexibility.\n\n- <b>Native Integration with Wallet Addresses</b>: Push Protocol enables\n  communication between wallet addresses without needing personal information.\n  This contrasts with some blockchain-based messaging systems that require\n  additional information or rely on smart contract-based user management.\n- <b>IPFS-based Storage</b>: Messages in Push Protocol are stored on IPFS,\n  ensuring decentralized and tamper-proof storage, while some blockchain-based\n  messaging systems store messages directly on the blockchain, which can be less\n  efficient and more costly.\n- <b>Spam Prevention</b>: Push Protocol focuses on spam prevention through\n  opt-in channels, chat requests, and inbox/request separation. In contrast,\n  some blockchain-based messaging systems might not have built-in spam\n  prevention mechanisms or rely solely on transaction fees to deter spam.\n\n## Push Protocol and Distributed Messaging Platforms\n\nPush Protocol offers unique features like opt-in channels, gasless transactions, and PGP encryption to create a seamless, secure, and user-centric communication experience.\n\n- <b>Built for Web3 Ecosystem</b>: Push Protocol is designed for the Web3\n  ecosystem, enabling wallet-to-wallet and dapp-to-dapp communication. This\n  focus ensures better integration and usability for Web3 applications than\n  general-purpose distributed messaging platforms.\n- <b>User-Centric Approach</b>: With its opt-in channels and chat request\n  mechanisms, Push Protocol adopts a user-centric approach to communication.\n  This empowers users to control their communication experience and minimize\n  spam, while some distributed messaging platforms might offer less fine-grained\n  control.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding these unique characteristics and advantages of Push Protocol compared to other decentralized communication methods enables developers to make more informed decisions about the technology that best suits their needs and build innovative applications that cater to the evolving demands of users in the digital world.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion.

This integration enhances the overall virtual event experience and opens up new possibilities for engagement and participation.\n\n## Privacy-First Approach\nPush Video Chat prioritizes user privacy by enabling participants to remain anonymous and protect their location information. The use of blockchain technology ensures secure and decentralized data management, minimizing the risk of data breaches or misuse.\n\n## Customization and Scalability\nWith Push Video Chat, developers have the freedom to create unique and interactive virtual event experiences tailored to their audience. These platforms leverage the scalability of blockchain technology to accommodate large-scale events without compromising performance or user experience.\n\n## Community Engagement and Interactivity\nPush Video Chat facilitates real-time audience interaction, empowering participants to actively engage with speakers, ask questions, and collaborate with other attendees. This high level of interactivity fosters a sense of community and promotes meaningful connections within the virtual event space.\n\n## Enhancing Virtual Events with Push Video Chat\nBy promoting the use of decentralized video chat and distributed communication infrastructure, we can empower event organizers, developers, and participants to create more engaging, secure, and inclusive virtual experiences. By integrating Push Protocol and decentralized video chat into mainstream event platforms, we can foster the widespread adoption of Web3 technologies in virtual events and social interactions.\n\nPush Video Chat offers a wide range of possibilities for enhancing virtual events. Here are a few examples of how it can be utilized:\n\n1. <b>Interactive Q&A Sessions</b>: Facilitate real-time interactions between speakers and attendees, allowing participants to ask questions and engage in 2.meaningful discussions through decentralized video chat.\n2. <b>Gamification and Rewards</b>: Integrate gaming elements and Web3-based rewards into virtual events, incentivizing participation and providing unique experiences for attendees.\n3. <b>Seamless Integration with Web3 Use Cases</b>: Incorporate features like Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) tokens or NFT-based event access to enhance engagement and provide verifiable proof of participation.\n4. <b>Decentralized Decision-Making</b>: Enable on-chain voting systems during virtual events to promote transparency, community involvement, and decentralized decision-making.\n5. <b>Web3 Sponsorships and Advertisements</b>: Utilize Web3 technologies in event sponsorships, such as offering NFTs or DeFi tokens as rewards, fostering brand engagement and promotion.\n\n## Conclusion\nPush Protocol’s video chat functionality offers a sophisticated solution that transcends traditional platforms. Its decentralized architecture ensures privacy, security, and scalability, empowering organizers and participants to create immersive and customizable experiences.\n\nEmbrace the power of Web3 technology and Push Protocol’s video chat to shape the future of virtual events, unlocking new dimensions of connection, collaboration, and intellectual exploration.

Through its Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, QuickSwap enables users to exchange tokens seamlessly in liquidity pools without the need for a traditional order book.\n\nIn addition to its core offerings, QuickSwap is building out its DragonFi Ecosystem as a one-stop shop for DeFi on Polygon — a place where Polygon users can come to trade, lend and borrow funds, play games, and more! This acts as a hub for various products such as QuickPerps, a decentralized Perpetual Exchange, and the Gaming Hub, further enriching the DeFi landscape.\n\nIn a significant development recently announced, we are excited to share that the [$PUSH token is now live on QuickSwap](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-is-live-on-polygon-quickswap-b683ef0f71d8), expanding the utility and accessibility of the $PUSH token within the Polygon ecosystem, and offering users new avenues to engage with the token. In addition, Quickswap will be using Push’s communication layer to send notifications to DeFi users on the platform and alert them about their positions and other on-chain actions.\n\nThis edition of “Frens of Push” features an interview with QuickSwap, shedding light on their mission, technology, and collaboration with Push. Let’s dive in!\n\n\n### 1. Tell us about QuickSwap — what’s it about, and what problem does QuickSwap solve?\nQuickSwap is the leading DEX and AMM on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, and Dogechain where users can trade, swap, LP, farm, and take part in other DeFi activities at lightning fast speeds and with near-zero gas fees. The DEX has helped spark adoption for DeFi across the Polygon ecosystem and has become an attractive environment for DeFi because of fast transaction speeds and low gas fees, in addition to the DragonFi ecosystem which serves as a hub for other products, such as QuickPerps (decentralized Perpetual Exchange) and the Gaming Hub.\n\n### 2. How do developers use QuickSwap? (feel free to add a step-by-step guide or quick tutorial like a video here )\nReferences here https://docs.quickswap.exchange/ https://github.com/QuickSwap\n\n### 3. What’s the 2023 plan for QuickSwap’s ecosystem?\nMultiple integrations with projects on all 3 ecosystems and QuickPerps — more info to be revealed but integrations mostly aimed at enhancing the UI/UX and adding more features for DEX users\n\n### 4. How is QuickSwap using Push’s web3 communication layer?\nQuickSwap will be using Push’s Web3 communication layer to enable push notifications for DeFi users on the DEX who want to be alerted about their positions and any other on-chain actions related to swaps, LP, farms, leverage trades, etc.\n\n### 5. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\nIt’s a pretty smooth UI and easy to understand, I like the simplicity. It seems to also offer a wide range of notifications and features\n\n### 6. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\nPerhaps besides just on-chain actions users could have a checklist of things they want to opt into for each protocol, such as other types of news feeds, updates on token listings, etc.\n\n## About Quickswap\nQuickSwap stands as a next-generation layer-2 DEX and AMM operating on Polygon. It facilitates rapid token swaps, liquidity provision, and yield farming with minimal gas fees. The platform’s AMM model eliminates order books, promoting seamless token exchange through liquidity pools.\n\nFor more information about Quickswap, check out their: [Website](https://quickswap.exchange/#/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/QuickswapDEX), [Telegram](https://t.me/QuickSwapDEX), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dSMd7AFH36), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPlF-DBwD-UzLFDzJ4Z5Fw), [Medium](https://quickswap-layer2.medium.com/)\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

We made some groundbreaking developments that have taken Push to new heights. Let’s dive into the major achievements that have shaped our journey this month.\n\n## Development⚒️\nMost notably, we’re thrilled to [unveil Push V2!](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-v2-is-live-new-rewards-utility-functionality-4d591284209d)\n\nThis update introduces exciting new features including brand [new yield farming rewards via Push Fee Pool Staking](https://medium.com/push-protocol/new-push-yield-farming-rewards-full-details-4a9ff473226d), Incentivized Chat functionality, [all-new Push Spaces](https://push-protocol.medium.com/push-spaces-is-live-decentralized-audio-and-video-streaming-is-here-bc77deed16ca) and Customized Profiles. All these features aim at empowering users, rewarding participation, creating a circular economy to democratize web3 communication and expand the horizons of dApp UX possibilities. We’re excited for the future!\n\nAnother major highlight of July was the [launch of $PUSH token on Polygon and Quickswap](https://push-protocol.medium.com/push-is-live-on-polygon-quickswap-b683ef0f71d8), providing multi-chain accessibility, usability, and composability. This launch, coupled with the Push v2 launch, unlocks new utility for $PUSH, creating endless possibilities for developers within the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nFollowing the successful launch of $PUSH on Polygon, we launched the [$PUSH-USDC lending & borrowing pool on Timeswap](https://push-protocol.medium.com/pushing-ahead-in-time-push-x-timeswap-6a94edaffc03), enabling users to borrow $PUSH at a fixed interest rate and lend $PUSH to earn a fixed interest rate. All enriched by Timeswap’s non-liquidatable loans & adjustable APR features.\n\nThere’s more! We continue to elevate the Push experience as we [unveiled Push Spaces](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-spaces-is-live-decentralized-audio-and-video-streaming-is-here-bc77deed16ca), a decentralized, incentivized, community-based streaming solution for the future of online communication. With Push Spaces, we’re continuing to build out the decentralized communication space by providing the web3 with better UX, privacy, and censorship-resistant communication solutions.\n\n## Frens of Push💜\nJuly was brimming with exciting partnerships, forging a stronger web3 communication ecosystem for Push and our frens. We’re excited to have new members in the fam:\n\n1. Our collaboration with [DataverseOS](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1678455797867585564) allows web3 data infrastructure developers to leverage the power of decentralized Push communication tools.\n2. The partnership with [Linea](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1678746417018413058) enables UX enhancements for builders using their zkEVM rollup.\n3. We are thrilled to power web3 messaging and notifications on [ReviseNFT’s LensBird](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1679083431022723072), a decentralized social gaming platform.\n4. We teamed up with [Idential](https://twitter.com/identialxyz/status/1674792960632975365?s=20) to provide users with real-time notifications to stay updated on new attestations.\n5. We’re excited to integrate Push Notifications for [Lif3 Wallet](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1680245839636176897) users, delivering real-time alerts based on individual configurations.\n\n## Featured In📰\nWe had the privilege of being featured and participating in various esteemed events and platforms:\n\n1. [EthCC was incredible](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1686053348619829256). We were delighted to be part of several awesome discussions and events.

Go to Yield Farming v2 Page on PUSH Dapp 👉 https://app.push.org/yieldv2\n2. Go to the left-hand part of the UI that displays the <b>PUSH Fee Staking Pool</b>.\n3. Click on the <b>Stake PUSH</b> button\n4. Once you click on stake, you will be prompted to enter the PUSH token amount you wish to stake. 👇\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./staking-pool.webp)\n\n5. Then, simply click on <b>Approve PUSH</b> button to approve the transfer of your tokens.\n\n6. Once completed, you should have the option to click on the <b>Deposit</b> button right away.\n\n7. After successful execution of your transaction, you should see the right staked amount in the UI.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./staking-pool2.webp)\n\n### Unstaking $PUSH Tokens\n1. Simply click on the <b>Unstake PUSH</b> button to unstake from the staking pool.\n2. After successful execution of your transaction, your tokens should be unstaked from the contract and transferred back to your wallet.\n\n<b>Important considerations for the unstaking procedure in Push Fee Staking Pool:</b>\n\n- The pool <b>doesn’t impose any lock-in period</b>. This means holders are free to stake or un-stake whenever they wish.\n- While no lock-in period is imposed, <b>there is a delay period of at least one epoch before a user can withdraw or harvest</b>. This means that any stake (within the current epoch) will require the user to wait T+1 epoch before they can claim rewards or withdraw their harvest. 1 epoch is 21 days long.\nUnstaking tokens in this pool will automatically harvest and transfer any pending reward tokens to your wallet as well.\n🟣 UNI-V2 LP Staking Pool\nThe UNI-V2 LP staking pool allows you to stake your LP tokens and earn yields for the same.\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\n    <b>Note:</b> In order to participate in this pool, providing liquidity to the PUSH/ETH Uniswap pool is the first step. To do that, simply:\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqMuOlOGP0s\" title=\"Push Uniswap V2 LP Staking Pool | $PUSH\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n1. Go to the [PUSH/ETH V2 pool on Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/ETH/0xf418588522d5dd018b425E472991E52EBBeEEEEE)  (Remember to navigate to Uniswap V2 pool and not V3 pool).\n2. Add liquidity into the pool with both $PUSH and $ETH.\n3. Once added, you should receive UNI-V2 LP tokens in your wallet.\n4. You are now ready to stake to these LP tokens into for Push V2 reward program.\n### Staking UNI-V2 LP tokens\n1. Go to Yield Farming v2 Page on PUSH Dapp 👉 https://app.push.org/yieldv2\n2. Go to the right-hand part of the UI that displays <b>Uniswap v2 LP Staking Pool.</b>\n3. Click on the <b>Stake $UNI-V2 LP Tokens</b> button\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./staking-pool3.webp)\n\n4. Enter the amount of LP tokens to be staked, and click on <b>Approve Uni-V2</b>\n\n5. Once approved, simply click on the <b>Deposit</b> button.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./staking-pool4.webp)\n\n6. After successful execution of your transaction, you should the right staked amount in the UI.\n\n### Unstaking UNI-V2 LP Tokens\n1. Click on <b>Unstake UNI-V2</b> button.\n2. This will trigger a metamask Pop-UP. Once confirmed you should simply be able to unstake your LP tokens from the pool.\n\n## How to Claim Rewards\nClaiming rewards for both the pools is fairly similar.\n\n1. Go to the respective pool on [Push Dapp Yield Farming V2 page](https://app.push.org/yieldv2).\n2. Click on the <b>Claim Rewards</b> button of the PUSH Fee Staking Pool or UNI-V2 Staking Pool.\n3. Confirm the transaction and rewards will be transferred to your wallet.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of considerations to keep in mind related when harvesting rewards.\n\n### 🔴 Harvesting in PUSH Fee Staking Pool\nThe very first claim reward procedure for this pool shall include two transactions:\n\n- 1st Transaction is <b>to Set Holder Delegation for the Push Core Contract address.</b>\n- 2nd transaction is to trigger the <b>primary harvest function of the Push core contract</b> to release the rewards.\n\n<b>What exactly is Setting Holder Delegation?</b>\n\n- The $PUSH token has a time-weightage feature within itself which allows the contract to calculate the holder weight of a $PUSH token holder based on how long he/she has been holding the token.\n- During the harvest, the core contract is designed to be capable of updating the holder weight of the caller to the latest block.\n- Therefore, this <b>set holder delegation</b>transaction approves the main Push Core contract to be capable of updating holder weight whenever needed.\n- It should be noted that this permission can be revoked anytime by the user.\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\n    <b>Note:</b> The setting holder delegation is a one-time process and only takes place during the very first instance of claiming rewards.\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n### 🟣 Harvesting in UNI-V2 LP Staking Pool\n- The steps for harvesting in UNI-V2 LP Staking Pool are identical to that of harvesting in the PUSH Fee Staking Pool\n- Go to the UNI-V2 LP Pool on [Push Dapp Yield Farming V2 page](https://app.push.org/yieldv2).\n- Click on the Claim Rewards button of the UNI-V2 Staking Pool.\n- Confirm the transaction and rewards will be transferred to your wallet.\n\n## How to migrate from the old staking pool to the new pool?\nIf you’re an early holder of $PUSH, chances are you’ve staked in the first rewards program.\n\nIf that’s the case for you, the migration feature is specifically designed to provide you with a smooth and easy procedure to shift from the old staking pool to the new v2 staking pool.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3QDLsT0VRM\" title=\"Push Migration Guide | $PUSH\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nMigration from old to new pools requires 3 simple transactions:\n\n1. <b>Unstaking from old contracts:</b> This transaction withdraws your staked tokens from the old contracts.\n2. <b>Approval of tokens:</b> This ensures you approve the new staking pool contracts.\n3. <b>Staking into new pool:</b> The final transaction ensures a successful deposit of your tokens to the new staking pools.\n\nIn order to perform the migration procedure, please follow the steps below:\n\n1. Go to Yield Farming v2 Page on PUSH Dapp 👉 https://app.push.org/yieldv2\n2. Go to the <b>Yield Farming V1 (Deprecated)</b> section.\n\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./staking-pool5.webp)\n\n### 🔴 For Push Staking Pool Migration\n1. Simply go to the Push Staking Pool section\n2. Click on <b>Migrate to PUSH Fee Pool</b> button\n3. After the above-mentioned 3 transactions, your staked tokens will be migrated from the previous $PUSH Token staking contract to the new $PUSH Fee Staking Pool <b><i>(which essentially is the main Push Core contract itself).</i></b>\n### 🟣 For UNI V2 Staking Pool\n1. The procedure remains the same as mentioned above.\n2. However, in this migration, your tokens will be staked in the new UNI-V2 Staking Pool.\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\n<b>Note:</b> Unstaking tokens from old staking contracts doesn’t ensure the claiming of pending rewards. Make sure you claim pending rewards (if any) from old staking pools after the migration is completed.\n\nIn order to claim any available pending reward from your previous pools, you can click on the Claim Rewards button of that respective pool in the Yield Farming V1 section.\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

This means stakers will now have the opportunity to earn incentives as the protocol continues to flourish.\n\nBegin staking 👉 https://app.push.org/yieldv2\n\n## Brief Glance at Push Liquidity Rewards Program v2\n1. <b>The v2 liquidity rewards program provides two options for participation:</b> UNI-v2 LP Token Staking: Similar to v1 incentive program, this procedure allows users to stake their UNI-v2 LP tokens in our staking contract and earn $PUSH tokens as a reward.\n2. <b>Push Fee Pool Staking:</b> The second procedure is the new staking feature of the Push Core V2 smart contract that allows users to directly stake in the core contract itself and earn rewardsx in $PUSH Tokens.\n\nThe Push Fee Pool collects $PUSH tokens in fees for Push Notifications, Channel-related actions, and Chat. These fees are hence distributed to all stakers in the Core v2 smart contract. Put most simply, these rewards are directly linked to the protocol’s growth. As the protocol grows with more channels, so do the fees and hence incentives that Push Fee Pool stakers can receive.\n\n## Important Details About the new Incentive Program\n1. All rewards will be distributed in $PUSH tokens.\n2. A total of <b>3,414,700 $PUSH</b> is allocated towards this reward program.\n3. Epoch Duration: Each epoch will be <b>21 days</b> long in the new rewards program. This is for both staking programs <b>UNI-v2 Staking and Protocol Fee Pool Staking.</b>.\n4. Staking will only be available through the official Push dApp [Incentives — Yield Farming page](https://app.push.org/yieldv2).\nWhile these are the high-level details related to Push Liquidity Rewards Program v2, let’s now dive in to get a complete understanding of the two different types of staking mechanisms.\n\n## Push Fee Pool Staking Details\n1. The staking mechanism in core v2 is epoch-based staking. That is, the entire distribution of rewards is split into epochs during which users can stake and rewards can be accumulated.\n\n2. <b>Epoch Duration</b>: Each epoch is <b>~21 days or 3 weeks long.</b>\n\n3. <b>Total Rewards Allocated: 1,323,100 PUSH + Core V2 Protocol Fees</b>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>\n    <b>Note:</b> The Push Fee Pool consists of two $PUSH token sources. The first source is from the collection of fees *that the protocol earns from channel specific actions like channel creation (as previously mentioned). The second source is from a manual release of 1,323,100 $PUSH tokens for every epoch. As such, staking in the Push Fee Pool entitles you to earn rewards from both these sources simultaneously\n    </i>\n</blockquote>\n\n4. <b>Staking $PUSH tokens</b>:\n\n- $PUSH token holders can stake their tokens at any given time in the Core v2 contract.\n- $PUSH has time weightage built in. This means people who have held $PUSH longer are rewarded more the longer they stake.\n\n5. Unstaking $PUSH Tokens\n\n- The staking algorithm of Core contract <b>doesn’t impose any lock-in period.</b> This means holders are free to stake or un-stake whenever they wish.\n- While no lock-in period is imposed, there is a delay period of at least one epoch before a user can withdraw or harvest. This means that any stake during a current epoch will require the user to at least wait T+1 epoch before they can claim rewards or withdraw their harvest. This is done to ensure bad actors can’t misuse epoch duration for unfair rewards.\n\n6. <b>Reward Harvesting</b>\n\n- The total rewards available and claimable in an epoch rely on the protocol’s fee pool, i.e. the amount of $PUSH earned by the protocol itself. The more $PUSH tokens accumulated by the protocol during an epoch, the more rewards for the stakers of that specific epoch.\n- When it comes to harvesting rewards from the contract, users harvest rewards for all the epochs in which they were staked. <b><i>\nThis basically means the longer a user stakes, the more rewards they should be able to harvest.\n</i></b>\n- Mentioned below is the formula used to calculate the rewards of any staker in a given epoch (N) 👇\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.webp)\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>\n    <b>Note:</b> An important detail here is users cannot claim rewards for the current epoch. For instance, if a user stakes at epoch 1 and tries to claim at epoch 6 (which is the current epoch), that user will only be able to claim for epochs 1 to 5. This is because epoch 6 is currently active, and the contract doesn’t allow claiming rewards from a current epoch.\n    </i>\n</blockquote>\n\n## UNI-v2 LP Token Staking Details\n1. The UNI-V2 LP staking is exactly the same to the previous staking program. That is, $PUSH token holders earn incentives for providing liquidity on Uniswap.\n\n2. <b>Total Rewards Allocated: 1,743,000 $PUSH tokens</b>\n\n3. <b>Epoch Duration</b>: Each epoch is <b>~21 days long or 3 weeks long.</b>\n\n4. <b>Staking UNI-V2 Tokens</b>\n\n- In order to stake in this program, users will first need to provide liquidity for PUSH on Uniswap.\n- This can be done by visiting the [PUSH/ETH Uniswap Pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xf418588522d5dd018b425e472991e52ebbeeeeee) and adding liquidity. Once added, users will be given Uniswap-V2 LP tokens which can then be staked on the UNI-V2 LP staking pool on the [Push dApp](https://app.push.org/yieldv2), to begin earning rewards.\n5. <b>Withdrawing UNI-V2 Tokens</b>\n\n- Users can withdraw their their UNI-V2 LP tokens from the [Push dApp staking portal](https://app.push.org/yieldv2) at any time.\n6. Reward Harvesting\n\n- Liquidity providers can harvest rewards for their staked amount by simply clicking onto the <b> Claim Rewards</b> button on the [Push Dapp Yield Farming V2 page.](https://app.push.org/yieldv2)\n- Allocated rewards will decrease for each sequential epoch.\n- Rewards will be distributed at the end of each epoch (21 days), to be shared in % proportion to a user’s contribution to the pool.\n- Earlier participants in the staking program will earn higher rewards.\n7. Mentioned below is the formula used to calculate the rewards for a given liquidity provider in the UNI-V2 LP Staking mechanism 👇\n\n### Migration from previous staking program\nIf you were part of the previous $PUSH staking program, it is recommended you simply migrate your previously staked tokens into the new staking pools.\n\nWe’ve made every effort to make this as simplified of a process as possible. The Push dApp will provide a <b>One-Click Migration</b> button for all stakers which will allow you to easily migrate all of your previous stakes to the new staking pools without any complications.\n\n<blockquote>\n    <i>\n    <b>Note:</b> A complete guide on the new Yield Farming V2 user interface navigation will be released in the next couple of days. This will include every imperative step of how to stake, unstake, harvest rewards, and migrate for any of the given pools, using the UI itself.\n    </i>\n</blockquote>\n\nHappy staking 👉https://app.push.org/yieldv2\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

This partnership opens up new opportunities for users to borrow and lend Push native tokens ($PUSH) while benefiting from the extensive functionalities and composability offered by TimeSwap and the Polygon network.\n\nPolygon, known for its high scalability and low transaction costs, provides the perfect environment to enhance the utility and functionalities of the $PUSH token. We couldn’t be more excited to start this journey!\n\n## Push x Timeswap\nTimeswap is the first fully decentralized AMM-based money market protocol that is non-custodial, immutable, censorship-resistant, and works without oracles or liquidators.\n\nWith the launch of the lending pool on TimeSwap, users can now borrow and lend $PUSH tokens on the Polygon mainnet, further enhancing the token’s utility and expanding its composability.\n\nThrough this partnership, Push gains access to Polygon’s ecosystem, offering users increased opportunities to explore various DeFi strategies, including:\n\n- Borrowing $PUSH at a fixed interest rate\n- Earn a fixed interest rate by lending $PUSH\n\n### A quick rundown of the pool\nThe PUSH-USDC pool will enable fixed-rate lending/borrowing of $PUSH token using USDC as collateral, with an initial APR of 30%.\n\n- <b>Pair:</b> PUSH/USDC\n- <b>Asset to be lent/borrowed:</b> PUSH\n- <b>Collateral:</b> USDC\n- <b>Transition price:</b> 0.40 PUSH/USDC\n- <b>Initial APR:</b> 30 %\n\nIn addition, Timeswap offers various benefits and customizable options that enhance their borrowing and lending experience for users like:\n\n- <b>No risk of sudden liquidation:</b> Unlike other protocols where borrowers may face liquidation during market volatility, TimeSwap offers non-liquidatable loans. Instead of being immediately liquidated, borrowers are given the opportunity to repay their debt before maturity. In case of default, their collateral is distributed to lenders or liquidity providers.\n- <b>Adjustable APR and Collateral Ratio:</b> TimeSwap provides users with the ability to customize their APR (Annual Percentage Rate) and CDP (Collateral Debt Position) ratio, allowing borrowers and lenders to adjust to their individual risk tolerance and market conditions.\n- <b>Market-determined CDP:</b> On Timeswap, the collateral ratio is determined by market participants instead of centralized entities or DAO governance, enabling cheaper loans and higher leverages.\n\nWe are incredibly excited about our partnership with Timeswap. This collaboration not only strengthens the Push ecosystem but also provides users with increased opportunities to participate in decentralized borrowing, lending, and earning. We cannot wait to see the beginning of a long journey with Timeswap!\n\n## $PUSH Token and its Utilities\nPush addresses a critical need in web3 by providing a decentralized communication protocol for dApp builders and web3 users. Push operates in a gasless, multi-chain, and platform-agnostic manner, facilitating seamless interactions among wallet addresses.\n\nPowering the Push ecosystem is the $PUSH token, fostering a circular economy within the protocol and incentivizing community participation. The $PUSH token serves several key purposes, including securing the network, network utility, Push DAO governance, and the reward pool fee. Let’s take a deeper dive into each of these:\n\n### 1. Securing the Network\nPush Nodes are incentivized to act in the network’s best interest through the use of $PUSH tokens in Proof of Stake. Nodes that remain synced and support network consensus are rewarded with $PUSH tokens, while those acting against the network’s interests are penalized.\n\n### 2. Network Utility\n$PUSH tokens are used as payment for message broadcasting on the Push network. Users must pay in $PUSH tokens to ensure their messages reach all interested parties. This incentivizes network nodes to relay the messages, contributing to a fast and reliable communication network.\n\n### 3. Push DAO and Governance\n53% of the $PUSH token supply is allocated to the community, empowering token holders to participate in governance and shape the future of Push Protocol. Token holders have the right to vote on critical decisions, including the staking structure, reward distribution rates, and other essential aspects of the protocol’s functioning.\n\n### 4. Push Fee Pool\nThe Push Fee Pool is designed to reward participants within the ecosystem, creating a circular economy. Fees collected at the protocol level, such as charges for “super users” and utility features, are distributed to $PUSH token holders, wallets that adopt Push, and other stakeholders contributing to the ecosystem’s growth and decentralization. The time-weighted feature of the $PUSH token ensures that long-term holders receive higher rewards.\n\nAdditionally, we’re continuing to develop new token utilities to drive adoption and participation as we expand our capabilities and presence on multiple chains. Our next big utility development is our launch on TimeSwap!\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

Push Spaces is the first decentralized audio and video streaming application in web3, built on top of Push Protocol’s existing communication ecosystem of 95k subscribers across 700+ applications and 3 ecosystems.\n\nWith Push Spaces, we’re continuing to build out the decentralized communication space by providing the internet with an alternative to today’s solutions. Specifically, our solutions have been built to provide a better UX, privacy, censorship-resistance, and community incentives.\n\nPush Spaces is currently available for audio streaming, with video streaming coming soon.\n\nReady to get started with Push Spaces?[ Start here!](https://push.org/spaces)\n\nAre you a developer wanting to integrate Push Spaces into your dApp? See our developer resources [here.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/restapi#for-spaces)\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image2.webp)\n\n\n## The Roadmap to Push Spaces\nWe’ve been [chatting about Push Spaces](https://twitter.com/harshrajat/status/1680123902465306624) for a little while, helping the web3 ecosystem imagine a world of decentralized, community-based streaming. Push Spaces comes on the heels of months of turmoil in the web2 social media space, ranging from corporate discord, censorship risks, and persistent UX pitfalls.\n\nSince its launch in early 2020, Push Protocol (previously EPNS) has been building out the decentralized communication layer for web3, starting with decentralized notifications. Recently, we announced [Push Chat](https://medium.com/push-protocol/announcing-the-push-chat-alpha-launch-f183765ec522), wallet-to-wallet text and video chat. With Push Spaces, we’re continuing to offer applications for developers and users alike, all built off the same multichain communication technology.\n\n## Push Spaces for Users\nPush Spaces is designed to intuitively operate like Twitter Spaces. Individuals can browse live and upcoming Push Spaces that are scheduled by individual wallets with host names, subject titles, and event information. Just like Twitter Spaces, you can host or join any open Push Spaces and chat, speak, and react. To host or join a Push Spaces, you need a crypto wallet, and Push is currently compatible with Ethereum, Polygon, BSC wallets. No transaction signature or gas/fee payment is needed to use Push Spaces.\n\nHowever, a “decentralized Twitter Spaces” is only the beginning of the vision for Push Spaces. As an open source protocol, Push invites developers to innovate on new ways to envision how audio and video streaming can look, including token-gated Spaces for community members.\n\n## Push Spaces for Developers\nThe Push Spaces app is live for the earliest version of audio streaming. But that’s only the beginning. We invite all web3 developers to explore how the Push Protocol suite can create a more complete and user-friendly dapp experience. Think about an application that delivers personalized notifications to users’ wallets, allows them to chat with customer support through decentralized chat, and keeps the community updated through regular decentralized Spaces — all done seamlessly, permissionlessly, and from the same verifiable wallets.\n\nJoin the community of developers already building on Push Protocol, and get started with Push Spaces — [start here!](https://push.org/spaces)\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QK6wx1wJ66A\" title=\"Push Spaces is Live! ✨\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion.

Unlike traditional chat systems tied to wallet addresses, Push NFT Chat allows chats to be specifically associated with individual NFTs owned by users. This is a game changer for chat integrations.\n\nWith Push NFT Chat, users now have the flexibility to choose whether their communications remain connected to their NFTs or their wallets.\n\nSo how does it all work?\n\n## Understanding Encryption Methodology of Push NFT Chat\nThe encryption methodology employed by Push Chat ensures secure and private communication while supporting the unique requirements of Push NFT Chat. Both Push Chat and Push NFT Chat rely on PGP keys which form the foundation for wallet-to-wallet communication. These keys are encrypted and stored on the Push Network, facilitating end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) universal inboxes.\n\nPush NFT Chat utilises a distinct encryption mechanism specifically tailored to support NFT chats. This approach combines security and versatility, allowing seamless integration with NFTs. The encryption process involves a three-pass encryption procedure for new users:\n\n1. A secret key is generated on the client side, automatically by the SDK, with the user having the option to choose the secret key if desired.\n2. The generated secret key is then used to encrypt the locally generated PGP key on the client side.\n3. Subsequently, the wallet encrypts the secret key itself, along with the encrypted PGP key. The encrypted versions of both the secret key and the PGP key are stored on the Push nodes.\n\nDespite the integration of NFT-specific features, the default behaviour of Push Chat remains intact. Users still sign in once to unlock their Push Profiles and initiate messaging. However, the updated implementation now offers support for chat and connection transfers when moving NFTs to different wallets.\n\nThis means, even if you move your NFT from one wallet to another, your chats still remain tied to that NFT. In the case of transferring ownership of your NFT, unless you give that new owner your password, they’ll be required to create a new chat profile and hence be unable to access your previous chats tied to the NFT (more on ownership transfer in Step 5 of Getting Started).\n\nThis enhanced functionality ensures a seamless and continuous user experience while maintaining the security and privacy of communications.\n\nThe encryption methodology of Push Chat guarantees the protection of user data and enables the integration of NFTs into the communication framework, empowering users to securely connect and communicate in the context of their NFTs.\n\n## Getting Started with Push NFT Chat\nTo get started with Push NFT Chat, the easiest approach is to utilise the Push SDK package. This can be seamlessly integrated into your frontend to develop custom NFT-tied chat systems. Additionally, Push NFT Chat can be deployed in the backend to implement automated chatbots or systems.\n\nThis guide is designed to showcase the straightforward process of building an NFT chat system with Push NFT Chat. Despite the complexity of the underlying logic, the Push Protocol abstracts away the intricacies, making the implementation remarkably simple for developers.\n\nFor the purpose of this guide, we will walk through the process of writing a simple TypeScript script to send NFT-tied chat messages.\n\n## Step 1: Setting up the Environment\nTo begin, you need to set up your development environment.\n\nEnsure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Node.js, TypeScript and ts-node. Create a new project directory and initialise it with a package.json file. Install the Push SDK package which will fetch and install the required dependencies.\n\n\n```js\n# create project directory\nmkdir nft-chat-guide\n# browse to project directory\ncd nft-chat-guide\n# Initialise the project\nnpm init --y\n# Install the dependencies\nnpm install @pushprotocol/restapi@latest ethers@^5.6\n# Create the main ts file\ntouch index.ts\n```\n\n<blockquote><i>Note: ethers is a peer dependency required by the restapi package</i></blockquote>\n\n## Step 2: Creating an NFT-Chat Profile\nBefore you can create an NFT-Chat profile, it is essential to have a wallet that owns an NFT. This ensures that you have a unique NFT to associate with your chat profile. You have the flexibility to choose from various options: you can utilise any NFT available or even create your own NFT contract and mint some NFTs specifically for this purpose.\n\n```js\n# setup .env file to store private info safely\ntouch .env\nnpm install dotenv\n# type definitions for nodeJs\nnpm install --save @types/node\n```\n\nInside index.ts add the following code to create a Push NFT chat profile.\n\n```js\nimport { PushAPI } from '@pushprotocol/restapi'\nimport { ENV } from '@pushprotocol/restapi/src/lib/constants'\nimport * as dotenv from 'dotenv'\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers'\ndotenv.config()\n\n// using staging environment\nconst env = ENV.STAGING\n\n/**\n* Creates a Push NFT Profile\n* @param signer - signer of wallet which owns the NFT\n* @param account - NFT account\n* @param password - password of NFT Profile\n*/\nconst PushAPI_nft_user_create = async (\n signer: ethers.Signer,\n account: string,\n password: string\n) => {\n const response = await PushAPI.user.create({\n   account,\n   signer,\n   env,\n   additionalMeta: { NFTPGP_V1: { password } },\n })\n return response\n}\n\nconst NFT_CHAT = async () => {\n // private key of wallet holding the NFT\n const nftHolderWalletPrivatekey1 = process.env.NFT_HOLDER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_1\n const nftSigner1 = new ethers.Wallet(`0x${nftHolderWalletPrivatekey1}`)\n // nft:eip155:${nftChainId}:${nftContractAddress}:${nftTokenId}\n const nftAccount1 =\n   'nft:eip155:5:0x42af3147f17239341477113484752d5d3dda997b:2'\n // user preferred profile password\n const nftProfilePassword1 = '@PushNFTProfile#01'\n const pushProfile1 = await PushAPI_nft_user_create(\n   nftSigner1,\n   nftAccount1,\n   nftProfilePassword1\n )\n console.log(pushProfile1)\n}\n\nNFT_CHAT()\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, the Push SDK handles the creation of data for your Push profile, incorporating verification proofs that are subsequently verified by the Push nodes. These verification proofs help establish the authenticity and integrity of your profile within the Push network.\n\nMoreover, the Push nodes play a crucial role in verifying the ownership of the NFT associated with your wallet on the blockchain. This verification process ensures that the NFT is genuinely owned by your wallet address, providing a secure and reliable connection between your NFT and your NFT-Chat profile.\n\n### Step 3: Sending messages to another Push Profile\nAn NFT-Push Chat Profile can send messages to another NFT-Push Profile or a wallet-based Push profile. In the following example, we would see how one NFT Profile can send a message to another NFT Profile.\n\n\n```js\nimport { PushAPI } from '@pushprotocol/restapi'\nimport { ENV } from '@pushprotocol/restapi/src/lib/constants'\nimport * as dotenv from 'dotenv'\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers'\ndotenv.config()\n\n// using staging environment\nconst env = ENV.STAGING\n\nconst NFT_CHAT = async () => {\n /**\n  * 1. PROFILE CREATIONS\n  */\n // 1.1 Create PushProfile#1\n const nftSigner1 = new ethers.Wallet(\n   `0x${process.env.NFT_HOLDER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_1}`\n )\n const nftAccount1 =\n   'nft:eip155:5:0x42af3147f17239341477113484752d5d3dda997b:2'\n const nftProfilePassword1 = '@PushNFTProfile#01'\n const pushProfile1 = await PushAPI.user.create({\n   account: nftAccount1,\n   signer: nftSigner1,\n   env,\n   additionalMeta: { NFTPGP_V1: { password: nftProfilePassword1 } },\n })\n // 1.2 Create PushProfile#2\n const nftSigner2 = new ethers.Wallet(\n   `0x${process.env.NFT_HOLDER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_2}`\n )\n const nftAccount2 =\n   'nft:eip155:5:0x42af3147f17239341477113484752d5d3dda997b:3'\n const nftProfilePassword2 = '@PushNFTProfile#02'\n const pushProfile2 = await PushAPI.user.create({\n   account: nftAccount2,\n   signer: nftSigner2,\n   env,\n   additionalMeta: { NFTPGP_V1: { password: nftProfilePassword2 } },\n })\n /**\n  * 2. SENDING MESSAGE FROM PROFILE#1 TO PROFILE#2\n  */\n // 2.1 Decrypt keys for PushProfile#1\n const decryptedPGPPrivateKey = await PushAPI.chat.decryptPGPKey({\n   encryptedPGPPrivateKey: pushProfile1.encryptedPrivateKey,\n   account: nftAccount1,\n   signer: nftSigner1,\n })\n // 2.2 send the actual message\n const response = await PushAPI.chat.send({\n   messageContent: \"Gm gm! It's me... Mario\",\n   messageType: 'Text', // can be \"Text\" | \"Image\" | \"File\" | etc\n   receiverAddress: nftAccount2,\n   account: nftAccount1,\n   pgpPrivateKey: decryptedPGPPrivateKey,\n   env: env,\n })\n console.log(response)\n}\n\nNFT_CHAT()\n```\n\nIn the Push NFT Chat system, messages are encrypted using the PGP public key of the intended receiver. This encryption ensures that only the recipient’s Push profile possesses the corresponding private key required to decrypt and access the chats. By utilizing PGP encryption, the security and confidentiality of the messages are upheld, providing a trusted communication channel.\n\nTo ensure decentralized storage and robust availability, the messages in Push NFT Chat are stored on IPFS. IPFS allows for distributed and peer-to-peer storage, ensuring that the messages are not reliant on a single central server. This decentralized storage approach enhances data resilience and availability, making the system more robust against failures or data loss.\n\nIn order to maintain a controlled and spam-free communication experience, when one Push profile attempts to send a message to another profile, it is delivered as an intent rather than a direct message. This means that the message is sent to the receiver as a request or proposal, requiring their approval before it is fully delivered and visible in their chat. This intent-based delivery system helps prevent spamming and unwanted messages, ensuring that the recipient has control over the content they receive.\n\n## Step 4: Getting chats, requests and approving intents\nContinuing from Step 3. we would now fetch all requests received by an NFT Profile and approve the intent.\n\n```js\n\n...\n...\n\n /**\n  * 3. GETTING ALL CHAT REQUESTS OF PUSHPROFILE#2\n  */\n // 3.1 Decrypt keys for PushProfile#2\n const decryptedPGPPrivateKey2 = await PushAPI.chat.decryptPGPKey({\n   encryptedPGPPrivateKey: pushProfile2.encryptedPrivateKey,\n   account: nftAccount2,\n   signer: nftSigner2,\n })\n // 3.2 Getting all requests or intents for PushProfile#2\n const requests = await PushAPI.chat.requests({\n   account: nftAccount2,\n   toDecrypt: true, // to decrypt the received request messages\n   pgpPrivateKey: decryptedPGPPrivateKey2,\n   env: env,\n })\n console.log(requests)\n // 3.3 Approve the request by PushProfile#2\n await PushAPI.chat.approve({\n   status: 'Approved',\n   senderAddress: requests[0].did, // push profile which sent the request ie nftAccount1\n   account: nftAccount2,\n   signer: nftSigner2,\n   pgpPrivateKey: decryptedPGPPrivateKey2,\n   env: env,\n })\n // 3.4 Fetching the chats of PushProfile#2\n // After approval of intent, messages sent by PushProfile#1 will be visible in chats of PushProfile#2\n const chats = await PushAPI.chat.chats({\n   account: nftAccount2,\n   toDecrypt: true, // to decrypt the received chat messages\n   pgpPrivateKey: decryptedPGPPrivateKey2,\n   env: env,\n })\n console.log(chats)\n}\n\nNFT_CHAT()\n```\n\n## Step 5: Transferring Chats on NFT transfer\nOn transferring an NFT the new NFT holder wallet has two choices:\n\n### 1. Starting as a fresh new Push Chat Profile with no previous history of past NFT owner chats.\n\n```js \n...\n...\n /**\n  * 4 PUSHPROFILE#1 TRANSFERRED NFT TO ANOTHER WALLET\n  */\n const newNftSigner1 = new ethers.Wallet(\n   `0x${process.env.NEW_NFT_HOLDER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_1}`\n )\n const newNftProfilePassword1 = '@NEWPushNFTProfile#01'\n // 4.1 New NFT Owner resets the Push NFT Profile\n const newPushProfile1 = await PushAPI.user.create({\n   account: nftAccount1,\n   signer: newNftSigner1,\n   env,\n   additionalMeta: { NFTPGP_V1: { password: newNftProfilePassword1 } },\n })\n}\n\nNFT_CHAT()\n```\n\n### 2. Continue with the chats of previous NFT owners.\n\n```js\n...\n...\n  /**\n  * 4 PUSHPROFILE#1 TRANSFERRED NFT TO ANOTHER WALLET\n  */\n const newNftSigner1 = new ethers.Wallet(\n   `0x${process.env.NEW_NFT_HOLDER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_1}`\n )\n const newNftProfilePassword1 = '@NEWPushNFTProfile#01'\n // 4.1 Decrypt the keys from password of the previous owner\n const profile1DecryptedPGPPrivateKey = await PushAPI.chat.decryptPGPKey({\n   encryptedPGPPrivateKey: pushProfile1.encryptedPrivateKey,\n   account: nftAccount1,\n   env: env,\n   additionalMeta: {\n     NFTPGP_V1: {\n       password: nftProfilePassword1,\n     },\n   },\n })\n // 4.2 New NFT Owner continues with the Old Profile with re-encrypting keys with new Wallet\n await PushAPI.user.auth.update({\n   pgpPrivateKey: profile1DecryptedPGPPrivateKey,\n   pgpEncryptionVersion: ENCRYPTION_TYPE.NFTPGP_V1,\n   signer: newNftSigner1,\n   pgpPublicKey: pushProfile1.publicKey,\n   account: nftAccount1,\n   env: env,\n   additionalMeta: {\n     NFTPGP_V1: {\n       password: newNftProfilePassword1, //new nft profile password\n     },\n   },\n })\n}\n\nNFT_CHAT()\n```\nContinuing the chats of the previous NFT owner requires the previous owner’s password. This means that the previous owner of the NFT has the option to decide whether or not to hand over the password to the new NFT owner.\n\nWhen ownership of an NFT tied to a chat profile is transferred from one individual to another, the previous owner’s password is necessary to maintain access to the ongoing chats associated with that NFT. This approach ensures that the new NFT owner does not automatically inherit access to the previous owner’s private conversations without explicit authorization.\n\nBy giving control over the password transfer to the previous NFT owner, Push NFT Chat respects the privacy and consent of all parties involved. It provides a transparent process where the previous owner can choose to share or withhold the password, allowing for a seamless transition of NFT ownership while maintaining the security and confidentiality of the chat history.\n\n## Exploring Additional Capabilities of Push NFT Chat\n- [Creating Public / Private Groups for NFT Chat Profiles](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-sdk/blob/88bafe49d489cfe399efa7166407a50574995b16/packages/examples/sdk-backend-node/src/main.ts#L1390)\n- [Listening to Chat Socket Events for NFT Chat Profiles](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-sdk/blob/88bafe49d489cfe399efa7166407a50574995b16/packages/examples/sdk-backend-node/src/main.ts#L1546)\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

Built on the Ethereum layer 2 system StarkWare, dYdX leverages zero-knowledge proofs to provide enhanced security, decentralization, and privacy to its users.\n\nAt its core, dYdX is designed for trading perpetuals, which unlike traditional futures or options, do not have expiration dates. This allows traders to speculate on the future value of an underlying asset indefinitely. This unique offering has attracted both institutional and retail traders, making dYdX one of the most popular exchanges in the market.\n\nThe collaboration between dYdX and Push is a game-changer in the DeFi industry, empowering traders worldwide with powerful, transparent, and fair financial products. dYdX’s mission to democratize access to financial opportunity aligns perfectly with Push’s commitment to fostering transparency and communication. Together, dYdX and Push are working together to enhance accessibility and pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable financial future.\n\nIn this edition of “Frens of Push,” we had the privilege of interviewing Cliffton Lee, Governance and SEA Lead at dYdX. Join us as we delve into the inner workings of dYdX, learn how they’re using Push’s communication layer, and gain insights into the vision and goals that drive this innovative DeFi platform.\n\n### 1. Hi Cliffton, what’s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\nMy name is Cliffton, and I work on all things Governance and Growth for the SEA region at the dYdX Foundation. I first got into crypto in 2017 when I purchased some BTC and ETH on Coinbase as an experiment, and it was only in 2020 that I went deep down the web3 rabbithole and deeply appreciated the importance of decentralized technologies, and how cryptography could enable that. I was drawn into Ethereum’s roadmap, scalability strategies via rollups, and this was how I got involved with dYdX.\n\n### 2. Tell us about dYdX — what’s it about, and what problem does dYdX solve?\ndYdX is the leading decentralized crypto perpetuals trading exchange. dYdX’s mission is to democratize access to financial opportunity. Few have access to advanced tools and products in the financial system, and dYdX believes in empowering more traders, in more places, with powerful, transparent, and fair financial products.\n\nWhile trading on dYdX, traders enjoy the security, privacy and decentralization benefits.\ndYdX is currently built on top of StarkEx, a layer 2 zero knowledge rollup to Ethereum, and there is works ongoing to build the next version of dYdX v4. dYdX v4 will be fully decentralized end to end, and will be a layer 1 Proof-of-Stake blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK.\n\n### 3. How do developers use dYdX?\nDeveloper documentation: https://dydxprotocol.github.io/v3-teacher/#terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy\n\nThese docs describe the v3 API for the dYdX decentralized perpetual contracts exchange. The exchange runs on an L2 (layer-2) blockchain system, and operates independently of previous dYdX protocols and systems, including the v1 and v2 APIs.\n\nLike the previous iteration of dYdX perpetuals, the exchange uses a centralized order book, but remains non-custodial, and settles trades and liquidations in a trustless manner.\n\n### 4. What’s the 2023 plan for dYdX and its ecosystem?\nThe main goal is to ship dYdX v4, and to enable the progressive decentralization of the protocol via governance.\n\n### 5. How is dYdX using Push’s web3 communication layer?\ndYdX users currently use Push to get notified of governance updates. Currently, dYdX stakeholders can subscribe to receive notifications when:\n\n- A DRC is created\n- The voting process for DRC begins\n- A DIP is created\n- The voting for the DIP is activated\n- The DIP is queued\n- The DIP is implemented\n\n### 6. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\nGreat! Community members have reached out mentioning that Push has been helpful in keeping them notified of what’s happening on the governance front. We’ve seen better engagement rates and higher vote participation.\n\n### 7. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\nWith dYdX moving to the Cosmos ecosystem, we’re hoping that Push can be compatible with the Cosmos SDK to continue this notification functionality.\n\n## About dYdX\ndYdX is a DEX on Ethereum providing a transparent and secure financial ecosystem for crypto trading. With a focus on empowering traders, dYdX provides advanced trading features such as margin trading and perpetual swaps. The platform utilizes a traditional orderbook + matching model for trading and has emerged as one of the most popular DEXes in the market.\n\nLearn all about dYdX: [Website](https://dydx.exchange/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dydx), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Tuze6tY), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/dYdXprotocol), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dydxprotocol/), [github](https://github.com/dydxprotocol)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

Since then, NFTs have gained significant popularity, transforming how we perceive and interact with digital art, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more.\n\nHowever, as the NFT space evolved, it became apparent that the ERC-721 standard had certain limitations. For one, the ERC-721 was not compatible with smart contracts and dApps across Ethereum. Additionally, due to static JSON metadata, ERC-721 tokens are inflexible when it comes to Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) codes, security, and efficiency.\n\nRecognizing the need to address these limitations, and enable NFTs to evolve over time, a new standard had to be introduced. Enter the ERC-6551 standard!\n\n## Understanding ERC-6551\nERC-6551, also known as token-bound accounts (or TBA), builds upon the ERC-721 standard by introducing smart contract capabilities to NFTs.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nTBA creates a smart contract wallet for each ERC-721, allowing them to perform transactions, interact with other dApps, hold tokens or other NFTs, or serve as an on-chain identity. TBA is also backward compatible with the ERC-721 standard, meaning that ERC-721 tokens can implement the ERC-6551 standard without requiring any significant modifications.\n\n## How Does ERC-6551 Work?\nThe ERC-6551 standard leverages a permissionless registry that is compatible with existing ERC-721 tokens. This registry serves as a factory and directory for creating and managing token-bound accounts. By calling a function on the registry and paying a small fee, anyone can create a token-bound account for an ERC-721 token. The registry deploys a proxy contract that represents the token-bound account, inheriting all the properties and metadata of the original ERC-721 token.\n\nThe proxy contract incorporates the EIP-1271 standard, enabling the token-bound account to sign messages and verify signatures on behalf of the NFT. This capability empowers token-bound accounts to interact with other smart contracts, including any dApps on the Ethereum network.\n\n## What Are the Core Benefits of ERC-6551 in the NFT Space?\n1. Enhanced Composability\n2. On-chain Interactivity\n3. Trackable History\n4. Metadata flexibility\n\n### Enhanced Composability\nERC-6551 allows for the bundling of NFTs with related assets, such as tokens or other NFTs, into a single profile. By consolidating tokens, assets, and NFTs within a single TBA, users can effortlessly transfer assets and seamlessly switch between platforms, greatly enhancing their experience.\n\n### On-chain Interactivity\nERC-6551 enables you to use your NFT address as your on-chain identity and hence interact with other on-chain smart contracts and dApps on the Ethereum network. All without relying on a wallet address.\n\n### Trackable History\nERC-6551 solves the problem of limited transaction history associated with traditional NFTs. With token-bound accounts, owners can obtain insights into an asset’s transaction history and utility beyond simple proof of ownership. This transparency adds value to NFTs and fosters trust and confidence among collectors and creators.\n\nMoreover, based on an NFT’s history, loyalty programs, in-game rewards, airdrops, and more can leverage this new functionality. For lending protocols, this could even facilitate the establishment of credit ratings in the future.\n\n### Metadata flexibility\nERC-721 NFTs have immutable JSON metadata. That is, once the NFT is minted the data can’t be changed. Conversely, ERC-6551 NFTs leave room for additional data and values to be added on the token, making them infinitely more flexible.\n\n## Potential Use Case Example: In-game enhancements\nPrior to the introduction of ERC-6551, players could own their in-game characters as ERC-721 NFTs. However, the assets they collected within the game existed as separate tokens in their wallets.\n\nToken-bound accounts change this dynamic by allowing game developers to create “inventories” for players. This means that all game-related assets can be automatically transferred into the character’s wallet, resulting in a smoother user experience. It also enables the creation of in-game user interfaces (UIs) that were previously challenging to implement.\n\nWhile this example is only one way ERC-6551 NFTs can be used, there are many more applications across DeFi, DAOs, and general web3 tools.\n\nTo read more about ERC-6551 EIP, you can do so here 👉 https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551\n\nBig congratulations and thank you to the team who helped author this incredible development: Jayden Windle, Benny Giang, Steve Jang, Druzy Downs, Raymond Huynh, Alanah Lam, Wilkins Chung, Paul Sullivan.\n\n## Pushing the Boundaries of ERC-6551 with Push NFT-to-NFT Chat\nIn addition to the release of ERC-6551, Push NFT Chat is also here, providing even more potential utility for NFTs.\n\nPush NFT Chat enables chats to be tied to a specific NFT owned by you, instead of a chat owned by a wallet address. Built as an extension of Push Chat, Push NFT Chat benefits from all the intuitive, user-centric features that Push Chat has while revolutionizing the way NFT holders interact.\n\nBy introducing web3 native NFT-to-NFT and dApp-to-NFT instant communication, we’ll be adding to the suite of enhancements that the recently launched ERC-6551 is also bringing to NFTs in web3.\n\nMore info about Push NFT Chat 👉 https://push-protocol.medium.com/introducing-push-nft-chat-chats-and-comms-tied-to-your-nfts-done-right-98717c04438d\n\nERC-6551 might just be the dawn of a new era of NFTs. This game-changing standard is set to break free from the limitations of static assets, paving the way for dynamic, interconnected digital experiences. As we embrace this new paradigm, we embark on an exciting journey where NFTs shape the future of digital ownership. We’re yet to see the boundless possibilities!\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

For the 1.5 Million+ NFT wallets and NFT collections like Azuki, BAYC, CryptoPunks, a universe of new potential utility is now here for your collections 🌎\n\nAs the team behind Push Protocol, we’ve been committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in web3 through decentralized communication. With our previous product, Push Chat, we successfully introduced native web3 instant chats using wallet addresses. Push Chat boasts a number of user-centric features like spam control, inbuilt notification modules, video and audio calls and [much more](https://push-protocol.medium.com/launching-the-future-of-web3-messaging-with-push-chat-push-group-chat-de4cb7a65231).\n\nToday, we’re taking Push Chat innovation to an entirely new level with the launch of Push NFT Chat. Built as an extension of Push Chat, Push NFT Chat benefits from all the intuitive, user-centric features that Push Chat has while revolutionizing the way NFT holders interact. By introducing web3 native NFT-to-NFT and dApp-to-NFT instant communication, we’ll be adding to the suite of enhancements that the recently launched [ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551) is also bringing to NFTs in web3.\n\nHow does Push NFT Chat specifically differ from Push Chat on a functional and security level? Read on to find out.\n\n## Introducing Push NFT Chat\nPush NFT Chat enables chats to be tied to a specific NFT owned by you, instead of a chat owned by a wallet address. It operates just the way Push chat operates for wallets and <b>includes all features you can find in Push chat</b> but with three main differences:\n\n- It uses triple encryption to ensure your chats are truly tied to an NFT and not a wallet alias.\n- The address format for Push NFT Chat is <b>nft:eip155:${nftChainId}:${nftContractAddress}:${nftTokenId} instead of eip155:${walletaddress}</b> (used in wallet to wallet communication)\n- Your communication moves with your NFT but only if you want them to\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.webp)\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>Developer Hint</i>: Push NFT Chat is already out:\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/restapi#for-chat\n\n<i>Developer Hint</i>: This example repo covers all functionalities that can be implemented from the SDK:\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-sdk/tree/main/packages/examples/sdk-backend-node\n</blockquote>\n\n## How does Push NFT Chat work?\nThe message abilities and features of Push NFT Chat are still based on PGP keys that power wallet-to-wallet Push Chat and are encrypted and stored on Push Network to enable an E2EE universal inbox. However, there are different features that enable Push NFT Chat, tie communication to the NFT, and validate it.\n\n### Encryption\nPush NFT Chat uses a different encryption mechanism to encrypt the PGP key. This is what makes it secure yet versatile to support NFT chats. Push NFT Chat uses three pass encryption and is done in the following way for a new user:\n\n- A secret key is randomly created for the user on client side, this is automated by SDK and invisible to the user though their are options available for a user to choose the secret key if they want.\n- This secret key is then used to encrypt the PGP key generated locally on the client side.\n- This secret key is then encrypted by the wallet of the user and the encrypted version of it and the encrypted PGP key is stored on the Push nodes.\n\nThis approach still results in the default behavior of signing once to unlock Push Profiles and start messaging, though it is now also capable of supporting chat and connections transfers when and if you move your NFT to another wallet.\n\nThis is enabled because of the three pass encryption which means your PGP keys can be decrypted and re-encrypted by a user if they have access to the secret key. Since the key itself is encrypted by the current wallet which holds that NFT, the decryption process doesn’t require manually entering the secret key as wallet signing is used to derive the decrypted secret key.\n\nThis creates an intuitive UX where user is not hassled by the experience while still gaining the crucial feature of truly connecting their chats and connections with the NFT.\n\n## Address Format\nApart from the way encryption is handled, the NFT chat uses a different address format for communication owing to them having access to various NFTs from the same wallet. The address format is <b>nft:eip155:${nftChainId}:${nftContractAddress}:${nftTokenId}.</b>\n\n<blockquote>\n <i>For example:</i>Lens NFT Chat will result in the address format as nft:eip155:137:0xDb46d1Dc155634FbC732f92E853b10B288AD5a1d:44433\n</blockquote>\n\nEach address format representing identifiers as follows:\n\n1. <b>nft</b> -> To segregate whether chat profile is for wallet or nft\n2. <b>eip155</b> -> Identifier for all EVM chains as per CAIP10, in the future other blockchain identifiers (non-Ethereum ones) will also be supported\n3. <b>${'nftChainId'}</b> -> Chain id on which the NFT is present, in case of Lens, it’s on Polygon whose chain id is 137\n4. <b>${'nftContractAddress'}</b> -> The contract address of the NFT, in case of Lens, it’s contract address for NFT is 0xDb46d1Dc155634FbC732f92E853b10B288AD5a1d\n5. <b>${'nftTokenId'}</b> -> The token id of the particular NFT held by the wallet of the user, in this example, we have taken that as 44433\n\n## Transferring the NFT\nThe key pair is encrypted by a secret key selected by the NFT holder. When the NFT holder decides to transfer the NFT to another user, two possible scenarios can occur:\n\n- In the first scenario, the original owner can choose to send the new owner the secret key. This allows the new owner to decrypt all the chat messages associated with the NFT. This option ensures the continuity of the chat messages within the NFT.\n\n<blockquote>\nThe original owner doesn’t have to remember or even decide this secret on creation as that can handled by the frontend or the SDK including encrypting it with your wallet (though the user is free to override it).\n</blockquote>\n\n- In the second scenario, the new owner doesn’t have a secret key at which point the NFT profile is created afresh. However, this means that the new owner will not have access to any previous chat messages linked to that NFT. This option prioritizes the security of the chat messages and ensures that no one else has access to them.\n\n<blockquote>\nThese two options enable pure, native NFT chat that is truly tied to a user NFT without sacrificing the security or the ability of transferring communication and connections. Instead, giving the control back to the user to decide what they want to do with their communications that they did with their NFT.\n</blockquote>\n\n## Guide for Getting Started With Push NFT Chat\nTo integrate with Push NFT Chat, you can start by watching the live demo below.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Im_5RRQyQP4\" title=\"Introducing Push NFT Chat | Live Demo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nBegin Building 👉 https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushpr...\n\nPush SDK Repo 👉 https://github.com/ethereum-push-noti...\n\nIf you need any help or support with integration, give us a shout out or tag us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ar8HkYNs).\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n<!--truncate-->\n\nOver the past year, our team has worked hard to create a strong foundation to build & scale the Push DAO.\n\nToday, we are launching the next phase of Push governance via the <b>Push Progressive Decentralization Roadmap</b>, opening opportunities for our community to get more involved with Push Protocol in our journey to become a community-owned project.\n\n## The TL;DR of Push DAO Phase 0\nBefore we get into the details of Phase 1, let’s look at the success of Phase 0.\n\nPhase 0 was focused on creating a thriving community and fine-tuning our governance processes. Here’s what we achieved in Phase 0:\n\n### Metagovernance\n- Implemented 4 roles with different capabilities to allow community members to participate in Push governance in a variety of ways. DAO members can vote directly in governance proposals or delegate their voting power to a delegate that represents their ideals.\n- Learning from best practices from other successful DAOs, we created an efficient mechanism to enable faster implementation and execution of important proposals that got immediate traction within the community.\n- Implemented PIPs (Push Improvement Proposals) to enable Push Protocol to work together with the community to form standardized, community-driven improvements, specs, and standards.\n- PGIP (Push Governance Improvement Proposals) and rewards: intended to open the floor for contributors with suggestions to improve the Governance process. These come attached with rewards upon the successful ratification and implementation of proposals.\n\n### Push Grants Program\n\n- After the successful first Grants Program, we took the feedback from the grantees and the community and launched the Push Grants Program v2.0.\n- PGPv2.0 enhances the companionship offered to projects and emphasizes a collaboration in which Projects grow hand by hand with Push — including guidance, mentorship, technical support, partnership intros, and more.\n- As of April 2023, the [Push Grants Ecosystem](https://twitter.com/Push_DAO/status/1638221385288785926) is made of 27 projects. More applications are already in queue to be reviewed by the Push Grants Review Committee.\n\n### Other Supporting Initiatives\n\n- <b>Rockstars of Push:</b> With the success of the original Rockstars of EPNS campaign, we extended the program one more season with Rockstars of Push vol2. The program is almost half way through and more and more we receive submissions from hackers, media content producers, and Push community members in general.\n- <b>Push Bug Bounty Program:</b> Approved via governance to allow community members and security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities in our systems\n\n## Enter Push DAO Phase 1\n\nIn the next phase of the Push DAO, we’ll focus on setting the foundation to achieve sufficient decentralization (community ownership). By building the Push DAO in a modular fashion over time, we intend to empower our community to work on initiatives that further the goals of the organization.\n\n<b>Push DAO phase 1 highlights:</b>\n\n- Official Start Date: April 3rd, 2023\n- Push Ambassadors Program v1.0\n- Community-Managed Push Grants Program\n- Open the floor for Push Contributors\n- DAO infrastructure\n\n### Push Ambassadors Program v1.0\n\nThe Push Ambassadors Program kicked-off phase 1 of the Push Decentralization Roadmap on April 3rd, 2023.\n\n- Initial focus on LATAM and Spanish-speaking communities\n- Marketing objective: Brand awareness. With content production in various platforms and formats.\n- Create a replicable Ambassadors Program that can be installed in other communities.\n\nThis program will run in the paid contributor modality, where the ambassadors will be the first official community contributors to the Push DAO. This comes together with contributor reputation and other important DAO activities that need to happen to build an effective, efficient, and decentralized DAO.\n\n### Community-managed Push Grants Program\nLessons learned during this second iteration of the Push Grants Program will be implemented for future editions to improve even more the program and maximize the benefit for the grantees. The process is now being fine-tuned to have minimal social coordination cost and enable the program to be managed by a <b>Grants Workstream</b>.\n\nMore details will be shared as we advance towards completing this goal!\n\n### Open the floor for Push Contributors\nThis will be an ongoing process that will happen slowly through the rest of the year in a controlled fashion, where the team will work closely with the contributors.\n\nSlowly giving control of the work streams to the community, and more important making sure all governance infrastructure and procedures are in place to empower the community and each work stream to operate, grow, and take decisions.\n\nThis will include the gradual influence of the Push DAO over earmarked PUSH allocation. The funds set aside for the Push DAO will eventually be entirely controlled by the DAO, and allocated towards initiatives voted on and approved through on-chain governance. This could include event sponsorships, developer grants, marketing initiatives, and more. The Community Fund, which currently sits with the Push Protocol entity, can choose to fund the Push DAO fund with more PUSH as requested from the DAO.\n\n<center> <b>.   .   .</b></center>\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThe focus of Governance Phase 1 is to lay the foundation that will help accelerate our 2024 plan of becoming a 100% community owned project.\n\nAs we continue making progress, we are looking to engage in more DAO-to-DAO collaboration opportunities, and make more work streams available for the DAO (moderation, governance, engineering, and more).\n\nThis will help us to realize our Push DAO vision of creating the necessary frameworks and tools to enable all forms of communication for everyone in web3 at a protocol level in a permissionless and seamless way.\n\nAs well as our Push DAO mission of revolutionizing the web3 UX by ensuring wallets, protocols and all web3 services are able to communicate via notifications, chats, video calls or more via a open and secure network.\n\nWe are excited about all the opportunities ahead and we are happy to continue BUIDLing and PUSHing together.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

This milestone signifies a significant step forward in ensuring the robustness and reliability of our platform.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n1. The two main features introduced in version 2 of our smart contracts are:\n    - <b>Push Fee Pool Staking</b>\n    - <b>Incentivized Chat Requests</b>\n\n2. With the launch of v2, the protocol aims to not only enhance the utility of the PUSH token but also enable an incentivization mechanism from the protocol level for all its users.\n\n3. $PUSH token holders shall now be able to earn incentives directly from the protocol. $PUSH tokens time based rewards multiplier also comes live. ie: the longer you have held the tokens, the higher your rewards will be.\n\n4. The design of v2 contracts ensures that the incentives for users are directly tied to the protocol. As the protocol expands its boundaries, the incentives for users that can be claimed from the contracts increase. <b><i>This implies that the more the protocol grows, the better the incentives become for users</i></b>.\n\n5. <b>Incentivized Push Chat</b> is a new feature introduced with version 2, that allows users to set a one-time fee for receiving chat requests. With the introduction of this feature, users will not only <b><i>gain enhanced control over incoming chat requests but also embark on a novel avenue for passive earnings</i></b>.\n\n## What’s next?\n- Push Protocol v2 tentative launch date is late June, 2023 along with [yield farming v2 for fee pool and Uniswap v2 LP pool](https://snapshot.org/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=RockstarsOfPushWeek17%2618Post#/pushdao.eth/proposal/0x54092053eff30c3c304e45b575881945192e710bc9b3914bfe1d1eadcda3f114).\n- This marks the beginning of [protocol fees](https://docs.push.org/hub/pusheconomics/push-token-economics#push-fee-pool) incentivizing and rewarding token holders and crypto wallets.\n- Push v2 has cleared Chainsafe audit. However, owing to the core and critical features of v2, the team has decided to launch it after 4 weeks.\n- This gives team enough time to run white hat contests among major platform(s) to ensure v2 is battle tested.\n- Prior to the tentative launch in late June, 2023, there will be an open, incentivized bug bounty program available to the community. More information coming soon.\n\nTime to dive deeper and understand the core features of Push v2 smart contracts and what it enables for web3 communication.\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n## Push Fee Pool Staking\nThe most significant feature of core v2 is the Push Fee Pool Staking.\n\nIn simple terms, this means PUSH holders can now stake and earn PUSH rewards directly from the core contract itself. As the protocol grows, so do the rewards.\n\n### What’s the Fee Pool?\nBefore delving into how the Core v2 staking works, let’s take a step back to quickly recap the concept of the Protocol Fee Pool.\n\nProtocol Feel Pool was introduced in the Version 1.5 of Push smart contracts. Fee Pool is a term used to signify small fees charged by the protocol actions like channel creation, channel reactivation, channel detail modification. They don’t affect users and for users, everything is always feeless, with the exception of few features for super users as [outlined here](https://docs.push.org/hub/pusheconomics/push-token-economics#push-fee-pool).\n\nIn other words, for every crucial transaction on the Core contract, it takes a small fee amount and stores it in what we call a <b>Push Fee Pool</b>.\n\nThe protocol fee is currently set to be equal to <b>10 PUSH tokens</b>. This value, however, can be changed by the community later using on-chain governance.\n\n<blockquote><i><b>Note:</b> This is not an additional fee that is charged on top of channel creation fees. Instead, the protocol fee is simply deducted from the same amount that a channel creator chooses to stake in the protocol.\nFor example, if you chose to stake 50 PUSH during channel creation, 10 of those 50 PUSH tokens go into Protocol Fee Pool, while the remaining goes into Channel Pool Funds that are claimable by channel owners anytime they choose to deactivate their channel.*\nRead more about Fee Pool and how it operates over here: https://docs.push.org/hub/pusheconomics/push-token-economics#push-fee-pool.</i></blockquote>\n\n## The Fee Pool Staking\nWith the introduction of [version 1.5 of the core contract](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-push-protocol-v1-5-80eb39b55424), we laid the foundation for the fee pool and the vision of incentivizing PUSH holders. However, the current version represents a substantial leap towards realizing this vision.\n\nThe fundamental concept behind the introduction of the fee pool in v1.5 of our contracts was to establish an incentivization mechanism at the protocol level. This mechanism enables both PUSH token holders and protocol users to directly earn incentives from the protocol itself.\n\nIt is worth noting that as the protocol expands its boundaries, the incentives available for users to claim from the contracts also improve. This eventually means that the more the protocol grows, the better the incentives for users. The direct correlation between protocol growth and user incentives creates a mutually beneficial relationship within the ecosystem.\n\nThe Version 2 of the Core contracts includes <b>Stake and Claim functionalities that allow $PUSH token holders to stake their tokens in the core contract and earn rewards from the fee pool directly</b>.\n\n### Details about Core V2 Staking\n- The staking mechanism in core v2 is technically epoch-based staking. The entire distribution of rewards is split into epochs during which the users can stake and rewards can be accumulated.\n- Each epoch is <b>~21 days long or 3 weeks long</b>.\n- $PUSH token holders can stake their tokens at any given time in the core v2 contract.\n- $PUSH had time weightage built in the token which also goes live with this update. This means that people who have held push longer are rewarded more the longer they stake.\n- The total rewards available and claimable in an epoch mainly rely on the protocol’s fee pool, i.e., the amount earned by the protocol itself. The more push tokens accumulated by the protocol during an epoch, the more rewards for the stakers of that specific epoch.\n- The total rewards are also [bootstrapped with yield farming for the next 84 weeks](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-dao-extends-liquidity-rewards-program-26008926b05a) after the protocol goes live.\n- The staking algorithm doesn’t impose any lock-in period. This means holders are free to stake or un-stake whenever they wish.\n- While no lock-in period is imposed, there is a delay period of at least one epoch before a user can withdraw or harvest. This means that any stake during a current epoch will require the user to at least wait T+1 epoch before they can claim rewards or withdraw their harvest. This is done to ensure bad actors can’t misuse epoch duration for unfair rewards.\n- When it comes to harvesting rewards from the contract, users shall be capable of harvesting rewards for all the epochs in which they were staked. <b><i>This basically means the longer a user stakes, the more rewards they should be able to harvest</i></b>.\n- An important pointer that must be noted here is users cannot claim their rewards for the current epoch. For instance, if a user stakes at epoch 1 and tries to claim at epoch 6 <b>(which is the current epoch)</b>, they should be able to claim for epochs 1 to 5. This is because epoch 6 is currently active, and the contract doesn’t allow claiming rewards from a current epoch.\n\n## Incentivized Push Chat\nWhile Push Chat has been bridging the communication gap of the entire web3 world, with the launch of our v2 contracts, we are introducing a new concept called <b>Incentivized Push Chat</b>.\n\nA brief glance at the current working mechanism of Push Chat shows us that any valid wallet address <b>(message sender)</b> can send a chat request to any other wallet address <b>(message receiver)</b>.\n\nAny new chat request sent by the sender simply lands under the <b>requests</b> tab of the receiver. And, the receiver can open, accept and respond to any chat request whenever he/she wants.\n\nHowever, in our continuous efforts to empower Push Chat users, we are enhancing the control they have over incoming chat requests. We believe that users should have the autonomy to determine and implement their own rules for handling these requests effectively.\n\nTo facilitate this, we will be introducing different types of settings within Push Chat:\n\n- <b>Open:</b> This setting allows unrestricted chat requests from anyone, giving users the flexibility to engage with a wide range of individuals.\n- <b>Blacklisted:</b> By selecting this setting, users have the ability to block incoming chat requests from everyone, ensuring a more private and exclusive chat experience.\n- <b>Incentivized Chat Requests:</b> With this setting, users can opt to enable a one-time fee for sending chat requests. This provides an opportunity for users to monetize their chat interactions and add value to each conversation.\n\n<blockquote><i><b>Note:</b> While the incentivized chat feature is being designed and developed to support multi-chain, for this specific version of the protocol, Incentivized Chat shall only support the Ethereum chain. Multi-chain support will be released with the upcoming versions of the protocol.</i></blockquote>\n\n### Deep diving into Incentivized Push Chat.\nIncentivized Push Chat introduces an innovative chat setting that empowers users to customize their experience by implementing a one-time fee <b>(in PUSH Tokens)</b> for individuals who wish to send them Push chat requests. By enabling this setting, users can ensure that anyone interested in initiating a push chat request must first deposit the specified fee before sending their message.\n\nThis feature grants users greater control over their chat interactions and enables them to monetize their engagement on the platform. In simpler terms, this innovative functionality empowers users to not just manage their chat interactions but also unlock new opportunities for generating income effortlessly. We feel this has great usage in driving creator economy and unleashing a new way for web3 communications to occur.\n\n<blockquote><i><b>Note:</b> Incentivized Chat Request only gives the sender the right to communicate to the receiver under chat request. The receiver still needs to accept the request to enable notifications and chat features. Ie. The receiver can still reject your messages while keeping the fee.</i></blockquote>\n\n### Brief glance at its Working Mechanism\nConsider two different users: <b>Message Sender & Message Receiver</b>\n\n### Enabling Incentivized Chat Request\n- It all begins with the <b>message receiver</b> selecting the Incentivized Push Chat setting for himself/herself.\n- As they opt for these settings, they must select the minimum amount of Push Tokens that any chat request sender must pay to be able to send chat requests to the receiver.\n\n<blockquote><i><b>Note:</b> In alignment with our smart contract’s design, it should be noted that a very nominal portion of this fee, specifically 10 PUSH tokens, is allocated to the Protocol Pool Fee.</i></blockquote>\n\n- Once this setting is enabled, the protocol guarantees that the recipient will only receive a chat request if the sender complies with the requirement of paying the specified amount of PUSH tokens.\n\n### Depositing Required Fee for Sending Chat Requests\n- Now it’s time to look from a message sender’s perspective.\n- As a sender, you will be shown the minimum amount of PUSH tokens that must be deposited to interact with users with incentivized chat requests enabled.\n- Therefore, the first step as a sender is to initiate the required fee payment and send the chat request right after. This boils down to one single function call from the Push Communicator contract, i.e., createIncentivizeChatRequest which handles all of it for the request sender.\n- Upon successful completion of this transaction, chat requests will be sent to the recipient, facilitating the establishment of a communication bridge between the two users upon acceptance of the request.\n\n### Multi-Chain Fee Deposits and Bridging\n- With Push Protocol’s expansion into multiple chains such as Polygon, BSC, and more, we have meticulously designed this feature to minimize any friction for users across these chains, ensuring a seamless experience beyond just Ethereum.\n- Therefore, as mentioned earlier, the creation of incentivized chat requests is incorporated within our communicator contract, which, unlike our core contract, is deployed across multiple EVM chains.\n- This essentially means users of any chain that is supported by Push Protocol can create incentivized chat requests from their respective chain itself, without the need to do the same from the Ethereum network.\n\n### Bridging:\n- It must be noted that users can create incentivized chat requests from any chain and deposit the push tokens on that chain’s communicator itself.\n- However, as per our contract’s design, any incoming fund must be handled and stored in the core contract that lies on Ethereum.\n- Therefore, any Push tokens deposited on communicator contracts of other EVM chains (supported by Push Protocol) shall essentially be bridged to the core contract which lies on the Ethereum chain itself.\n- In order to ensure the bridging procedure is handled adequately, we will be using the Wormhole interoperability protocol for the cross-chain movement of the tokens.\n\n### Claiming Chat Incentives\n- As a final step, the core contract shall allow any user to claim their chat incentives directly from the core v2 contract on the Ethereum network.\n- It should be noted that while users from any supported chain can create incentivized chat requests and deposit PUSH tokens, the tokens are essentially bridged and moved to the core contract on the Ethereum network.\n- Therefore, it’s extremely easy for the message or request <b>receivers</b> to simply pull out their claimable funds directly from the core contract itself, instead of jumping from one chain to another.\n\n## Why Incentivized Push Chat?\nThe Incentivized Push Chat feature offers several potential use cases that can benefit users in various ways.\n\n### Creator Economy / Monetization:\n- Professionals, Thought leaders, or experts in Web3 or any specific field can utilize the incentivized chat feature to monetize their knowledge and provide personalized advice or consultations through Push chat.\n- This can drive the growing web3 creator economy and can enable web3 social to have various features that are currently not present in web2.\n\n### Spam Prevention:\n- While Push already has state of the art anti-spam features enabling users to accept chat first before they can be notified and / or have access to features like video calling, etc. Incentivized push requests takes it further for popular wallets who now can have a way to even prioritize their Push chat requests.\n- The fee acts as a deterrent for low-quality or irrelevant requests, ensuring that users receive more meaningful and valuable messages.\n\n### Enhanced privacy and exclusivity:\n- The one-time fee requirement adds an extra layer of exclusivity and privacy for users. It can deter casual or unwanted interactions, ensuring that users only receive requests from individuals who are genuinely interested and willing to invest in the conversation.\n- It can be particularly valuable for influencers or public figures who want to manage their interactions and maintain a more selective and focused engagement with their audience.\n\n<blockquote><b>Note:</b> Version 2 of the Push Core and Communicator smart contracts will be deployed in the next few weeks. All the above-mentioned new features will come into effect post the deployment.</blockquote>\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

We will explore the benefits these tools offer and provide a step-by-step guide on the development process. Additionally, we’ll examine how to utilize Push Protocol for decentralized messaging to improve communication and collaboration within your dApp ecosystem.\n\nFinally, we’ll share valuable tips and best practices for designing a successful reputation system that benefits all participants, fostering a vibrant and resilient environment for users, developers, and stakeholders. By grasping the nuances of decentralized reputation systems and leveraging Alchemy and Push Protocol, you’ll be poised to develop an innovative, trustworthy, and impactful solution for the decentralized world.\n\n## Overview of Reputation Systems\n\nReputation systems are mechanisms designed to assess and quantify the trustworthiness, reliability, or quality of entities, such as users or services within a given network. These mechanisms rely on factors such as past performance, user ratings, reviews, and other relevant data points to establish an individual’s or an organization’s reputation score. This score then serves as a reference for other participants when making decisions, such as choosing a service provider or engaging in a transaction.\n\nHere are some examples of reputation systems commonly used today:\n\n- Amazon Seller Rating: Amazon assigns a rating to each seller based on factors such as shipping time, order accuracy, and customer service. Buyers can use this rating to evaluate a seller’s reputation before making a purchase.\n- Airbnb Host Rating: Airbnb uses a rating system to assess the reliability and quality of hosts based on factors such as communication, cleanliness, and accuracy of listing descriptions. This rating can help potential guests decide whether to book a listing or not.\n- Uber Driver Rating: Uber’s rating system allows passengers to rate their driver after a trip based on factors such as driving skills, punctuality, and professionalism. These ratings can help future riders decide which driver to select for their next trip.\n\nIn each of these examples, the reputation system assigns a score or rating to a participant based on their behavior and interactions within the platform. This score can then be used by other participants to evaluate the trustworthiness, reliability, or quality of the individual or organization.\n\nUnlike traditional centralized reputation system which can be subject to biased or unreliable information due to their inherent limitations, decentralized reputation systems provide a more transparent and equitable approach. These systems play a critical role in empowering users and developers in the decentralized ecosystem by establishing trust and credibility based on the actions, history, and behavior of participants.\n\n## Decentralized Reputation Systems\n\nJust as centralized reputation systems do in web2, decentralized reputation systems allows users to establish trust and credibility within a blockchain-based web3 ecosystem. Decentralized reputation systems can be used in various contexts, such as peer-to-peer marketplaces, decentralized lending platforms, and social networks. The key benefits of decentralized reputation systems include the following:\n\n- Enhanced trust and transparency through the use of blockchain technology.\n- Reduced reliance on centralized authorities for reputation management.\n- The ability to leverage decentralized messaging for real-time reputation updates and notifications\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide For Building a Decentralized Reputation System with Alchemy and Push Protocol\n\n1. Designing Smart Contracts\n2. Building a User Interface\n3. Integrating with Alchemy and Push Protocol\n\n## 1. Designing Smart Contracts\n\nTo create the foundation for your decentralized reputation system, you’ll need to develop smart contracts that handle:\n\n- User registration and identity management.\n- Reputation scoring, based on criteria such as transaction history and user feedback.\n- The storage and retrieval of reputation data on the blockchain.\n\nYou can write your smart contracts using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), and thoroughly test them with tools like [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) and [Remix](https://remix-project.org/).\n\nHere’s an example of a simple decentralized reputation system using a Solidity smart contract:\n\n```js\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract DecentralizedReputationSystem {\n    struct UserProfile {\n        address userAddress;\n        uint256 reputation;\n        string name;\n    }\n\n    mapping(address => UserProfile) public userProfiles;\n    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public feedbackGiven;\n\n    event NewUserRegistered(address userAddress, string name);\n    event FeedbackReceived(address from, address to, uint256 reputationDelta);\n\n    function registerUser(string memory _name) public {\n        require(userProfiles[msg.sender].userAddress == address(0), \"User already registered\");\n\n        UserProfile memory newUserProfile = UserProfile({\n            userAddress: msg.sender,\n            reputation: 0,\n            name: _name\n        });\n\n        userProfiles[msg.sender] = newUserProfile;\n        emit NewUserRegistered(msg.sender, _name);\n    }\n\n    function giveFeedback(address _to, uint256 _reputationDelta) public {\n        require(userProfiles[msg.sender].userAddress != address(0), \"User not registered\");\n\n        require(userProfiles[_to].userAddress != address(0), \"Feedback recipient not registered\");\n\n        require(!feedbackGiven[msg.sender][_to], \"Feedback already given\");\n\n        userProfiles[_to].reputation += _reputationDelta;\n        feedbackGiven[msg.sender][_to] = true;\n        emit FeedbackReceived(msg.sender, _to, _reputationDelta);\n    }\n\n    function getUserReputation(address _user) public view returns (uint256) {\n        require(userProfiles[_user].userAddress != address(0), \"User not registered\");\n        return userProfiles[_user].reputation;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis smart contract defines a simple reputation system with the following features:\n\n- User registration: Users can register themselves with a name using the registerUser function. Each user is identified by their Ethereum address.\n- User feedback: Registered users can provide feedback to other registered users by invoking the giveFeedback function. This function increases the reputation of the recipient user by the specified amount. Users can only give feedback to another user once.\n- User reputation: The getUserReputation function can be called to retrieve the reputation of a registered user.\n\nWhen applying this to real-world scenarios, it’s essential to consider integrating advanced features like confining feedback to interactions within the system, introducing reputation decay, or establishing dispute resolution mechanisms. Additionally, opting for a more refined token-based system can streamline the tracking and management of reputation scores.\n\n### Integrating Gitcoin Passport for Identity Management\n\nIn addition to designing smart contracts for user registration and identity management, integrating Gitcoin Passport can significantly enhance your decentralized reputation system.\n\nGitcoin Passport is a decentralized identity solution that allows users to create and manage their online identities across multiple dApps. By using Gitcoin Passport, you can take advantage of its built-in features, such as user verification, data portability, and seamless integration with other dApps.\n\nTo integrate Gitcoin Passport, follow the [official documentation](https://www.gitcoin.co/passport) and explore resources available in the Gitcoin ecosystem.\n\n## 2. Building a User Interface\n\nDevelop a user-friendly interface that allows users to:\n\n- Register and manage their profiles.\n- View the reputation scores of other users.\n- Provide feedback and rate other users based on their interactions.\n\nPopular frontend frameworks, such as [React](https://react.dev/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/), can be used to build your user interface. Integrate [Web3.js](https://web3js.org/#/) or [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) libraries to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs you develop the user interface for your decentralized reputation system, integrate Gitcoin Passport to handle user registration and authentication. This will allow users to create and manage their online identities across multiple dApps while utilizing your reputation system.\n\nEnsure your user interface is compatible with Gitcoin Passport by following the <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/passport\"><b>official documentation</b></a> and integrating the required libraries and components.\n\n## 3. Integrating with Alchemy and Push Protocol\n\n## Alchemy\n\n[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) provides powerful web3 development tools that help you build and scale your dApp with ease. In the context of a decentralized reputation system, Alchemy can be used to access the Ethereum blockchain data for user profiles, reputation scores, and feedback. Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/) for more details.\n\nHere is a sample workflow to integrate Alchemy:\n\n<b>Step 1:</b> Create an Alchemy account and obtain your API key.\n\n<b>Step 2:</b> Replace your Ethereum node URL with your Alchemy API endpoint.\n\n```js\nimport { ethers } from \"ethers\";\n\nconst alchemyApiKey = \"your_alchemy_api_key\";\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider(\"goerli\", alchemyApiKey);\n```\n\n<b>Step 3:</b> Use Alchemy’s monitoring tools to track your dApp’s performance and usage.\n\n## Push Protocol\n\n[Push Protocol](https://push.org/) can be used to create a real-time messaging system for your decentralized reputation system, allowing users to receive updates about their reputation scores and feedback instantly. Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.push.org/developers) for more details. The official PUSH-SDK packages are also available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/~pushprotocol).\n\nHere is a sample workflow to integrate Push Protocol:\n\nInstall and configure the necessary dependencies:\n\n```js\nnpm install ethers @pushprotocol/restapi @pushprotocol/socket\n```\n\nInitialize the Push Protocol client in your frontend.\n\n```js\nimport { Client } from \"@pushprotocol/socket\";\n\nconst pushClient = new Client({\n applicationId: \"your_application_id\",\n applicationToken: \"your_application_token\",\n});\n```\n\nCreate channels for various reputation-related events, such as new feedback, score updates, and user interactions.\n\n```js\nconst feedbackChannel = pushClient.channel(\"feedback\");\n\nconst scoreUpdatesChannel = pushClient.channel(\"scoreUpdates\");\n\nconst userInteractionsChannel = pushClient.channel(\"userInteractions\");\n```\n\nImplement listeners in your frontend to receive and display real-time updates.\n\n```js\nfeedbackChannel.on(\"newFeedback\", (data) => {\n // Handle new feedback data and update the user interface\n});\n\nscoreUpdatesChannel.on(\"scoreUpdate\", (data) => {\n // Handle score updates and refresh the user interface\n});\n\nuserInteractionsChannel.on(\"userInteraction\", (data) => {\n // Handle user interactions and update the user interface accordingly\n});\n```\n\nBy integrating Push Protocol, you can enhance user experience and provide real-time, decentralized messaging for reputation updates and notifications.\n\n## Additional Resources and Tutorials\n\nDevelopers seeking more in-depth guidance can refer to the following resources:\n\n- Alchemy documentation: https://docs.alchemy.com/Push \n- Protocol documentation: https://docs.pushprotocol.io/Solidity \n- documentation: https://soliditylang.org/\n\n## Tips to Remember for Building a Successful Decentralized Reputation System\n\nTo create a successful decentralized reputation system using Push Protocol and Alchemy:\n- Focus on user experience and ensure that the reputation scores and feedback mechanisms are intuitive and easy to use.

Integrating the Alchemy SDK & Initializing Push Protocol\n\nIntegrate [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=push-protocol) as your Ethereum node provider for faster and more reliable access to the blockchain data. Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/) for more details.\n\nHere is a sample workflow to integrate Alchemy:\n\n- Create an Alchemy account and obtain your API key.\n- Replace your Ethereum node URL with your Alchemy API endpoint\n\n```js\nimport { ethers } from \"ethers\";\n\nconst alchemyApiKey = \"your_alchemy_api_key\";\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider(\"mainnet\", alchemyApiKey);\n```\n\nNow, we can initialize Push Protocol. Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.push.org/developers) for more details. The official PUSH-SDK packages are also available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/~pushprotocol).\n\nHere is a sample workflow to integrate Push Protocol:\n\n```js\nimport { PushRestApiClient } from \"@pushprotocol/restapi\";\nimport { PushSocketClient } from \"@pushprotocol/socket\";\n\nconst pushRestApiClient = new PushRestApiClient({\n applicationId: \"your_application_id\",\n applicationToken: \"your_application_token\",\n});\n\nconst pushSocketClient = new PushSocketClient({\n applicationId: \"your_application_id\",\n applicationToken: \"your_application_token\",\n});\n```\n\n## 3. Designing a Dashboard\n\nDesign a user-friendly dashboard that provides relevant real-time analytics for blockchain transactions. Consider including:\n\n- A summary of key metrics, such as transaction count, average gas price, and transaction volume.\n- A list of recent transactions with relevant details like transaction hash, sender, recipient, and value.\n- Interactive charts displaying trends in transaction volume, gas prices, and other metrics over time.\n- Filters and search functionality to help users easily navigate the data\n\nPopular frontend frameworks, such as [React](https://react.dev/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/), can be used to build your user interface. Integrate [Web3.js](https://web3js.org/#/) or [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) libraries to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTo quickly spin up a Next.js-based Web3-ready dApp with an integrated components library, check out <a href=\"https://createweb3dapp.alchemy.com/\"><b>Alchemy’s Create Web3 DApp</b></a> tool. This resource is fully open-source and designed to help users get started with building their dApps.\n\n## 4. Listening to New Blocks and Fetching Transaction Data\n\nCreate a function that listens to new blocks and fetches transaction data:\n\n```js\nconst { Alchemy, Network } = require(\"alchemy-sdk\");\n\nconst alchemyConfig = {\n apiKey: \"your_alchemy_api_key\",\n network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,\n};\n\nconst alchemy = new Alchemy(alchemyConfig);\n\nasync function listenToNewBlocks() {\n alchemy.core.on(\"block\", async (getBlockNumber) => {\n   const block = await alchemy.core.getBlockWithTransactions(getBlockNumber);\n   const transactions = block.transactions;\n   // Process the transactions and update the dashboard\n   updateDashboard(transactions);\n   // Emit a real-time event through Push Protocol for connected clients\n   await pushRestApiClient.emit(\"transactions\", { transactions });\n });\n}\n\nlistenToNewBlocks(); // Invoke the function when the application starts\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we import and set up the Alchemy SDK. Then, we modify the <b>listenToNewBlocks()</b> function to use the <b>alchemy.core.onBlock()</b> method to listen for new blocks and <b>alchemy.core.getBlockWithTransactions()</b> method to fetch transaction data.\n\nFor more advanced users, you can consider using custom webhooks. Custom webhooks offer several benefits in this scenario, including:\n\n- <b>Flexibility:</b> Gain more control over the logic and triggers for real-time updates, allowing you to create event-driven workflows tailored to your dashboard’s needs.\n- <b>Scalability:</b> Utilize serverless architectures like AWS Lambda to handle increasing load and ensure application responsiveness during peak usage.\n- <b>Reliability:</b> Improve fault tolerance by implementing redundancies and fallback mechanisms, reducing reliance on third-party services for real-time updates.\n- <b>Reduced Latency:</b> Optimize data flow from the blockchain to your application, minimizing latency for a more responsive user experience.\n\n## 5.Updating the Dashboard UI\n\nCreate a function to update the dashboard UI with new transaction data:\n\n```js\nfunction updateDashboard(transactions) {\n // Update the dashboard UI with new transaction data\n // This will depend on the frontend framework you're using\n}\n```\n\n## 6. Receiving Real-Time Transaction Updates\n\nFor clients to receive real-time transaction updates, set up a listener for the Push Protocol events:\n\n```js\nconst transactionsChannel = pushSocketClient.channel(\"transactions\");\n\ntransactionsChannel.on(\"transactions\", (data) => {\n const transactions = data.transactions;\n updateDashboard(transactions);\n});\n```\n\nWith this setup, your application will listen to new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain using the Alchemy provider. When a new block is detected, it fetches the transaction data and updates the analytics dashboard. Additionally, it emits a real-time event through the Push Protocol REST API so that connected clients receive updates instantly. Clients listen for these events using the Push Protocol Socket client and update their dashboards accordingly.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a high-level example and is meant to serve as a sample. Depending on your specific requirements, you will need to customize and expand this code to fetch and display additional data or integrate with other services.\n\n## Tips to Remember When Building a Successful Real-Time Analytics Solution\n\nTo create a successful real-time analytics dashboard for blockchain transactions using Alchemy and Push Protocol, we suggest keeping these things in mind:\n\n- Focus on providing relevant, actionable insights that users can use to make informed decisions. To do this, harness Alchemy’s robust infrastructure and enhanced APIs to fetch your blockchain data, as well as Push Protocol’s real-time communication capabilities.\n- Implement data caching and other performance optimization techniques to minimize latency, taking advantage of Alchemy’s efficient APIs and Push Protocol’s instantaneous updates.\n- Regularly update and refine your dashboard based on user feedback and changing market trends, using the insights provided by Alchemy’s monitoring tools and Push Protocol’s user engagement features.\n- Integrate your dashboard with other blockchain tools and platforms to provide additional value and context, leveraging the compatibility and versatility of both Alchemy and Push Protocol in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBuilding a real-time analytics dashboard for blockchain transactions with Alchemy and Push Protocol can provide valuable insights and improve user experience.\n\nBy following the steps outlined in this blog post and leveraging the powerful features of these tools, you can create an engaging and informative dashboard that benefits both developers and users alike.\n\nWe encourage you to experiment with the technology and share your experiences with the community.

This enhancement to Graviton’s user experience is enabling creators to communicate directly with their audience, share updates, and receive valuable feedback. In turn this is helping artists create and build their own communities. Additionally, Graviton is planning to expand capabilities with Push Chat and plans to introduce Group and Video Chat functionalities in the near future.\n\nIn this episode of “Frens of Push,” we are thrilled to have [Troy Murray](https://twitter.com/TroyMurs), CEO and co-founder at Graviton, join us for an insightful conversation about his journey in web3 and the groundbreaking solutions they are building for creators. We discuss decentralized communication, facilitated by Chat and Direct Messaging, and the doors it opens in the creator economy.\n\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\n\n## 1. Hi Troy, what’s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space?\n\nI started working in Crypto around 2013 and became active in the Bitcoin community. From there I was interested in Smart Contracts around Ethereum and started to work closely with ConsenSys. I joined one of their spokes, SingularDTV and helped design a DAO for their software. I left that company and co-founded BarnBridge, a DeFi protocol, from there I went and co-founded Graviton a c-corp based in Puerto Rico that builds WEB3 tools, services, and platforms for the Metaverse.\n\n## 2. Tell us about Graviton — what’s it about, and what problem is Graviton solving?\n\nGraviton was founded out of what we felt was the need to create easy to use front ends for every day users to access the metaverse using polished web3 tools, services and platforms. We also wanted to prove our thesis that Protocols and the DAOs that control them are just a part of the tech stack and that you need a company to actually take multiple different protocols and wrap them up in a single platform. This is where Xeenon came from. We use Livepeer protocol for transcoding of videos, LENS protocol for social and PUSH protocol for direct messaging.\n\n## 3. How do developers use Xeenon?\n\nXenon is for creators and it is a streaming service that looks very much like what most people are used in a streaming service but under the hood the entire tech stack is built on decentralized technology from the transcoding all the way to the o-auth.\n\n## 4. What’s the 2023 plan for Xeenon and its ecosystem?\n\nWe plan on growing the creator and fan experience on the platform and funding new ways for creators to monetize their work and also allow the fans to share in their economic flywheel.\n\n## 5. How is Graviton building with Push Chat?\n\nWe integrated Push Chat into our Xeenon platform for Direct Messaging and look forward to including Group and Video Chat soon.\n\n## 6. How have you seen Push Chat integration enhance your UX?\n\nThe ability of content creators to directly communicate with their fans on the platform is a huge win for us. We plan on adding more features to make the experience more intimate and with the coming updates to the protocol send tips and other things inside the platform through chat.\n\n## 7. What cool use cases do you see Push and Push Chat being used for in the future?\n\nI’m really excited to get group and video chats going on the platform. Long term the way we can use this for community communication is gonna get really interesting.\n\nThank you :)\n\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center><br/>\n\n<i>“Frens of Push” is our weekly content series to spotlight outstanding projects that are building with Push.

Designing Smart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are the backbone of your dApp, defining the rules and logic for your gaming collectibles. To learn more about smart contracts and blockchain development, check out <a href=\"https://university.alchemy.com/\"><b>Alchemy University</b></a>.\n\nYou’ll need to create smart contracts for:\n\n- Creating and managing collectibles (e.g., ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens).\n- Handling transactions, such as trading and transferring collectibles\n- Implementing any game mechanics or rules associated with your collectibles.\n- You can write your smart contracts using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), and thoroughly test them with tools like [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) and [Remix](https://remix-project.org/).\n\nHere’s an example of a simple blockchain-based gaming collectibles system using a Solidity smart contract:\n\n```js\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol\";\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\n\ncontract GamingCollectibles is ERC721, Ownable {\n   uint256 private _tokenIdCounter;\n\n   struct Collectible {\n       uint256 tokenId;\n       string name;\n       uint256 power;\n   }\n\n   mapping(uint256 => Collectible) public collectibles;\n\n   event NewCollectibleCreated(uint256 tokenId, string name, uint256 power);\n\n   constructor() ERC721(\"GamingCollectibles\", \"GCOL\") {}\n\n   function createCollectible(string memory _name, uint256 _power) public onlyOwner {\n       uint256 newTokenId = _tokenIdCounter;\n       _mint(msg.sender, newTokenId);\n       _tokenIdCounter++;\n\n       Collectible memory newCollectible = Collectible({\n           tokenId: newTokenId,\n           name: _name,\n           power: _power\n       });\n\n       collectibles[newTokenId] = newCollectible;\n       emit NewCollectibleCreated(newTokenId, _name, _power);\n   }\n\n   function transferCollectible(address _to, uint256 _tokenId) public {\n       require(ownerOf(_tokenId) == msg.sender, \"Not the owner of the collectible\");\n       safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, _to, _tokenId);\n   }\n\n   function getCollectibleDetails(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (Collectible memory) {\n       return collectibles[_tokenId];\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThis smart contract defines a simple gaming collectibles system with the following features:\n\n- ERC721 standard: The contract inherits from the OpenZeppelin’s ERC721 and Ownable contracts, which provide a standard implementation for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ownership management.\n- Creating collectibles: The contract owner can create new gaming collectibles by invoking the createCollectible function, providing a name and power for the new collectible. A unique token ID is assigned to each collectible, and a NewCollectibleCreated event is emitted.\n- Transferring collectibles: Users can transfer their collectibles to other users by calling the transferCollectible function. The function checks if the sender is the owner of the collectible before transferring it.\n- Querying collectible details: The getCollectibleDetails function allows users to query the details of a specific collectible using its token ID.\n\nThis is a basic example to demonstrate the concept. In a real-world implementation, you might want to consider adding more sophisticated features, such as a marketplace for trading collectibles, game mechanics that involve the collectibles, or integrating with other platforms for a richer gaming experience.\n\n⚠️ <b>Disclaimer:</b> This example smart contract is for educational purposes only and should not be used in production without a thorough audit and review by experienced developers.\n\n## 2. Building the User Interface\n\nCreate an engaging user interface that allows players to interact with your dApp. This includes:\n\n- Viewing their collectibles inventory\n- Initiating trades and transfers\n- Participating in any game mechanics or activities associated with your collectibles\n\nPopular frontend frameworks, such as [React](https://react.dev/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/), can be used to build your user interface. Integrate [Web3.js](https://web3js.org/#/) or [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) libraries to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFor more advanced gaming experiences, consider using game engines like <a href=\"https://unity.com/\"><b>Unity 3D</b></a>, which supports WebGL export, or <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/\"><b>Unreal Engine</b></a> for AAA-quality graphics. These engines provide more sophisticated tools for building immersive gaming environments and can be integrated with blockchain technologies for managing gaming collectibles.\n\nIf you’d really like to test the limits, consider using WebAssembly-based (WASM) approach to build high-performance web3-based games.\n\n## 3.

It dictates how incentives are created, distributed, and managed within the network. Push Protocol is a decentralized communication layer for Web3 that uses a native token, $PUSH, to incentivize its network participants.\n\nIn this post, we’ll take a closer look at Push token economics and explore how it differs from other token systems. We’ll also examine the specific incentives driving the Push Protocol network and how they contribute to the network’s overall success.\n\n## Push Token Economics: An Overview\n\nPush Protocol’s token economics aim to create a circular economy run by the community, for the community. The goal is for every participant to be rewarded for their contributions while simultaneously discouraging behavior that would be detrimental to the network. The $PUSH token is at the center of the ecosystem, providing incentives for all network participants.\n\nThe $PUSH token is used in four primary ways within the Push Protocol ecosystem: securing the network, network utility, Push DAO and governance, and the reward pool fee. As Push Protocol expands to more chains and adds new forms of communication, more utility for $PUSH may emerge in addition to the four primary use cases.\n\n## 1. Securing the Network\n\nPush Nodes are an integral part of the Push Protocol network. These nodes allow Push Protocol to facilitate communication across multiple blockchains while retaining governance on the Ethereum mainnet. Push Nodes can be run by anyone and are incentivized to act in the network’s best interest through the use of $PUSH tokens in Proof of Stake. Nodes that continue to reach consensus and operate in the network’s best interest are rewarded in $PUSH tokens. Conversely, Push Nodes that do not remain synced with consensus or attempt to damage the network are penalized with the $PUSH tokens these bad actors staked.\n\n## 2. Network Utility\n\n$PUSH tokens are used as payment for message broadcasting on the Push Protocol network. When users broadcast a message, they must pay in $PUSH tokens to deliver that message to all interested parties. This payment incentivizes nodes on the network to relay the message to their peers, ensuring that the network remains fast and reliable.\n\n## 3. Push DAO and Governance\n\n53% of the supply of $PUSH has been allocated to the community to define the future of Push Protocol and its development. $PUSH also gives owners the right to vote on critical protocol decisions, including the staking structure, staking mechanisms, and reward distribution rates.\n\nGovernance votes can include:\n\n- The structure of the fees paid by services\n- The DeFi mechanism for the staking pool\n- Other protocol incentivization and financial elements\n\nPush Protocol adheres to Progressive Decentralized Governance. That is, a structure where power in decisions making is gradually distributed to the community. This approach allows token holders to have a say in the protocol’s future direction, ensuring that the network remains aligned with the community’s interests.\n\n## 4. Push Fee Pool\n\nThe Push Fee Pool is designed to reward various participants, fostering a circular economy within the Push Protocol ecosystem. As the community moves towards greater decentralization, the network will determine fees, such as those charged to “super users” of chat and notifications (protocols sending large volumes of notifications) and fees related to the utility features of the protocol. It is essential to note that all fees are charged at the protocol level.\n\nThese fees are then distributed to $PUSH token holders and cryptocurrency wallets adopting the Push Protocol. The participants receiving rewards include token holders, wallet providers, and other stakeholders contributing to the ecosystem’s growth and decentralization.\n\nThe $PUSH token incorporates a time-weighted feature, enabling the protocol to identify and reward token holders who have maintained their $PUSH holdings for extended periods. This mechanism ensures that long-term supporters of the project receive proportionally higher rewards.\n\nIn summary, the Push Fee Pool aims to clarify the following points:\n\n- Various participants, including token holders, wallet providers, and other stakeholders, are rewarded through the Push Fee Pool.\n- Fees are charged at the protocol level and can include charges for “super users” and utility features within the Push Protocol.- \n- The fees collected are not from liquidity pools but rather from protocol-level activities.\n- The $PUSH token’s time-weighted feature ensures that long-term token holders receive proportionally higher rewards.\n\n## Key Features of Push Tokenomics:\n\nPush Protocol’s token economics model is designed with several essential features to promote a robust and sustainable ecosystem:\n\n1. Circular Economy: The tokenomics aims to reward all network participants, encouraging them to hold onto tokens and contribute to the network’s growth and development.\n2. Hybrid Proof of Stake Mechanism: Push Protocol utilizes a hybrid Proof of Stake mechanism to secure the network. Rewards and penalties in $PUSH tokens incentivize good behavior and deter bad actors.\n3. Community-driven Governance: The Push DAO and governance system empower the community to influence the network’s future direction, ensuring alignment with the interests of its members.\n\nWhile some of these features may share similarities with other tokenomic models, the combination of these elements within Push Protocol’s ecosystem helps create a unique and thriving environment for its users and stakeholders.\n\n## The Role of Incentive Schemes in Blockchain Networks\n\nIncentive schemes play a significant role in driving participation and fostering growth in blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. While they are not the sole determinant of success, well-designed incentives can encourage users to hold onto their tokens, actively engage with the network, and contribute to its growth and development. Common incentive schemes include proof of stake, proof of work, token burning, airdrops, staking, liquidity mining, and gamification. By striking a balance between incentivization and other factors such as technology, governance, and community engagement, a project can increase its chances of long-term success and sustainability.\n\nLet’s break them all down:\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism that uses token staking to incentivize network participants to act in the network’s best interest. In PoS, validators stake tokens to verify transactions, and those who verify transactions correctly are rewarded with additional tokens. Those who act against the network’s best interests may lose their staked tokens.\n\nProof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism that uses computational power to verify transactions. In PoW, miners solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the problem is rewarded with new tokens, and their block is added to the blockchain. PoW is resource-intensive and may lead to centralization.\n\nToken Burning removes tokens from circulation by sending them to an address that no one can access. Token burning can be used to increase the value of existing tokens by decreasing the overall supply.\n\nAirdrops are used by cryptocurrency projects to distribute free tokens to users. Airdrops can be used to increase network participation and attract new users. This is especially helpful for a project just starting out.\n\nStaking is a mechanism that allows users to hold tokens for a specific period to receive rewards in return. Staking incentivizes participants to hold onto their tokens and participate in the network; the longer they stake, the greater their rewards will be.\n\nLiquidity Mining incentivizes users to provide liquidity to a specific pool in exchange for tokens collected from trading fees. The more liquidity that is provided, the greater the rewards will be.\n\nGamification is a process of incentivizing users to complete specific actions. This can include completing transactions, referring friends, or engaging with the platform in other ways. By providing rewards for these actions, users are encouraged to continue using the platform and contributing to its growth and development.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPush Protocol’s token economics are designed to create a circular economy that incentivizes and rewards all network participants, while deterring behavior that would be detrimental to the network. Token economics and the resulting incentives play a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of a given cryptocurrency or project. Push Protocol achieves this through its use of a hybrid Proof of Stake mechanism and its Push DAO and governance system, which give the community a say in the network’s future direction and foster a collaborative environment.\n\nAs the Push Protocol community continues to grow and evolve, the team is constantly looking to add more utility for the $PUSH token. This includes exploring new use cases for the token and incentivizing more participants to hold and use the token. The community plays a crucial role in fostering this innovation and contributing to the network’s growth and development.\n\nIncentives and token economics are essential components of any successful blockchain or cryptocurrency project. Push Protocol’s token economics exemplify a system that incentivizes participants to secure the network, pay for message broadcasting, and participate in network governance. As Push Protocol expands to more chains and adds new forms of communication, it will be exciting to see how its token economics evolve to create even more incentives for network participants. We invite you to join the Push Protocol community and discover the power of its token economics for yourself.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

It’s a security program that enables users to communicate securely by decrypting and encrypting messages — but how does it work?\n\nIn this article we will explore how PGP encryption works and how it pertains to Push Protocol. Let’s dive in.\n\n## The Fundamentals of PGP Encryption\n\nPGP encryption works by combining symmetric-key and public-key cryptography. The process involves the following steps:\n\n### Key Generation:\n\nEach user generates a public and private key pair. The public key is shared openly, while the private key remains confidential.\n\n### Encryption:\n\nWhen sending a message, the sender uses the recipient’s public key to encrypt the message. This ensures that only the intended recipient with the corresponding private key can decrypt the message.\n\n### Signing:\n\nThe sender can digitally sign the message using their private key, creating a unique signature. This signature can be verified using the sender’s public key, ensuring the message’s authenticity and integrity.\n\n### Decryption:\n\nUpon receiving the message, the recipient uses their private key to decrypt it and, if applicable, verify the digital signature using the sender’s public key.\n\n## An Example with Bundesbank🏦\n\nAccording to their [official website](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/service/banks-and-companies/pki/pgp/pretty-good-privacy-pgp--621112), the Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, uses PGP encryption to secure confidential email communications. They employ a single PGP key for the entire organization (except for a few local installations). The key is 2048 bits long and valid until June 9, 2030. This key can be used to reach almost all Bundesbank email addresses securely.\n\nHere is an example of Bundesbank uses PGP encryption for emails:\n\n<b>Step 1: Obtain the Bundesbank’s PGP Public Key</b> First, you need to obtain the Bundesbank’s PGP public key. You can find it on their website or request it from the bank’s contact. The fingerprint of their PGP public key is:\n\n7976 022F 5061 3189 F250 A187 3746 D004 4D8B 595E\n\n<b>Step 2: Import the Bundesbank’s PGP Public Key</b> Import the Bundesbank’s public key into your PGP software or email client (such as GnuPG, Thunderbird with Enigmail, or Outlook with Gpg4win).\n\n<b>Step 3: Compose Your Confidential Email</b> Write your confidential email to the Bundesbank using your preferred email client.\n\n<b>Step 4: Encrypt the Email</b> Before sending the email, use your email client’s PGP functionality to encrypt the email with Bundesbank’s public key. This ensures that only the Bundesbank, with the corresponding private key, can decrypt and read the email.\n\n<b>Step 5: Sign the Email (Optional)</b> You can also choose to sign the email using your own PGP private key digitally. This allows the Bundesbank to verify your identity and the integrity of your message using your public key.\n\n<b>Step 6: Send the Encrypted Email</b> Finally, send the encrypted email to the intended Bundesbank email address. The email will be securely transmitted and can only be decrypted and read by the Bundesbank.\n\nBy using PGP encryption, you can ensure that your confidential email communication with the Bundesbank remains secure and private, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access or tampering.\n\nThe example of Bundesbank using PGP encryption for secure email communication demonstrates the effectiveness of PGP encryption in protecting sensitive information in the traditional financial world. However, with the increasing connectivity and decentralization of communication systems, there is a need for secure messaging protocols that can ensure safe and confidential communication across a distributed network.\n\nThis is where the use of PGP in a decentralized communication protocol like Push Protocol comes in. Push Protocol provides high security and privacy for messaging systems by using PGP encryption in a distributed network of push delivery nodes. The push delivery nodes are responsible for delivering encrypted messages to their intended recipients in a secure and reliable manner.\n\nThe use of PGP encryption in the Push Protocol ensures that messages are encrypted end-to-end, meaning that only the sender and the recipient can decrypt and read the message. This provides a high level of security and privacy, even in a decentralized network.\n\n## PGP Encryption in Push Protocol: A Step-by-Step Process\n\nThe implementation of PGP encryption inPush Protocol involves several steps:\n\n### Key Storage:\n\nA PGP key pair is generated for their address when a user logs into Push Protocol for the first time. The private key is encrypted using the user’s public key and sent to Push Nodes for storage, while the public key is stored locally on the user’s device and used to encrypt outgoing messages.\n\n### Message Encryption:\n\nWhen a message is sent, the client-side application encrypts the message payload using the [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), which is a widely used and secure encryption algorithm. The AES algorithm is a complex encryption algorithm that uses a symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt data.\n\nA unique AES secret key is generated for each message, which is then encrypted using the PGP public keys of the sender and recipient. This ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the message, and that the message content remains secure and private during transit.\n\n### Message Transmission:\n\nThe encrypted message payload and AES secret key are sent to the Push Nodes, which then forward the message to the recipient.\n\n### Message Decryption:\n\nUpon receiving the message, the recipient decrypts the AES key using their PGP private key and then decrypts the message payload using the decrypted AES key.\n\n## Future-proofing PGP Encryption in Push Protocol\n\nThe flexibility and extensibility of PGP encryption in Push Protocol ensure that the system remains future-proof and adaptable. This means:\n\n### Multi-Chain Compatibility:\n\nAs blockchain networks adopt various encryption methods, Push Protocol can still facilitate secure communication by encrypting PGP keys using multiple methods.\n\n### Security Evolution:\n\nAs new security threats and vulnerabilities emerge, Push Protocol can upgrade its encryption methods easily, ensuring users’ communications remain protected and private.\n\nIn conclusion, by integrating PGP encryption into Push Protocol, Push’s messaging system provides a secure and private messaging solution for blockchain-based applications. The decentralized nature of Push Protocol, combined with the reliability and adaptability of PGP encryption, ensures users can communicate and transact with confidence. This is thanks to the fact messages and transactions are protected against interception and tampering. Additionally, Push Protocol’s ability to easily upgrade its encryption methods in response to new security threats and vulnerabilities further enhances its ability to provide secure and private messaging services.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

This is particularly useful for projects that demand frequent and recurring transactions. By enabling real-time payments, Superfluid allows for fast and frictionless value transfer without gas fees. The protocol’s commitment to trustlessness and decentralization makes it a popular choice among organizations that value security and transparency in their payment processing.\n\nWhile the demand for asset streaming grows in web3, communicating with users through their wallet addresses has been challenging. That’s where Push comes in! With Push’s communication tools, Superfluid is able to notify users about their streams, helping them manage their token balances, keeping their subscriptions, DCAs, and payments flowing.\n\nIn this episode of ‘Frens of Push’, we are in conversation with [Vijay Michalik](https://twitter.com/vijaymichalik) to talk about Superfluid’s solutions, its vision, and journey with Push.\n\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\n\n## 1. Hi there, how did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What’s your story?\n\n<i>Vijay Michalik, Product Lead, Superfluid</i>\n\nI started exploring crypto as an analyst in 2014 and 2015, and met a bunch of the great people working on early Ethereum between Devcon1 in London and several different events in Summer 2016.\n\nWhen ConsenSys launched a London office in summer 2017 I signed up, working across business analyst, business development and community roles until moving into the Protocol Engineering team in 2018, eventually becoming a Product Manager for Hyperledger Besu & Quorum.\n\nI signed up for Superfluid in 2021 as the first Product hire to help build the second iteration of Superfluid’s user and developer product lineup and help capture the great opportunities ahead of us for the Superfluid Protocol. Since then I’ve been building the team and our lean iteration muscles exploring a bunch of new features and products.\n\n## 2. Tell us about Superfluid — what’s it about, and what problem does Superfluid solve?\n\nSuperfluid is the leading asset streaming protocol that enables Web3 native recurring payments like subscriptions, salaries and rewards for DAOs and crypto-native businesses. It can be used to describe cash flows and execute them automatically over time fully on-chain.\n\n[Superfluid streams](https://medium.com/superfluid-blog/superfluid-streams-5cc5141dd8a7) transfer value in a constant flow over time between wallets, in a non-custodial and permissionless way. Streams are programmable, composable, and modular, allowing developers to build custom applications on top of the protocol.\n\nThe protocol has been <b>designed as a toolbox</b> for web3 businesses and developers to build custom applications with their own logic.

ShapeShift is community-owned, open-source, and completely decentralized. With a user-friendly interface and secure transactions, ShapeShift has become a top choice among web3 traders and investors alike.\n\nAs a DAO seeking to communicate with users without compromising their personal information, privacy and security are particularly important for ShapeShift. ShapeShift leverages Push’s secure notifications to keep users informed about governance, wallet and product updates. With a notification feed directly in the app, users can also easily access all Push notifications from their subscribed channels, enhancing their user experience.\n\nIn this episode of ‘Frens of Push’, we sat down with Willy from ShapeShift to talk about its partnership with Push and how ShapeShift is utilizing notifications to enhance the UX on its platform. Willy also shared his excitement about the future of this partnership, especially with the advent of Push Chat.\n\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\n\n## How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What’s your story?\n\nShapeShift was started in 2014 in the wake of the devastating Mt. Gox hack from which millions of bitcoin were stolen. ShapeShift was created as the first way to trade crypto non-custodially from your own wallet rather than needing to deposit onto a centralized exchange.\n\nWilly started building in the blockchain space in 2017 when he co-founded Bitfract. Bitfract was built on top of ShapeShift’s trading API and was the first tool to enable trading Bitcoin for multiple cryptocurrencies in a single transaction. In 2018, ShapeShift acquired Bitfract.\n\n## Tell us about ShapeShift — what’s it about, and what problem does ShapeShift solve?\n\nShapeShift is focused on building the ultimate interface to the decentralized universe. The early version is live now on app.shapeshift.com and also available in both the iOS and Android app stores.\n\nThe problem that ShapeShift solves is two-fold. On one hand, custodial crypto is centralized. This makes it risky, burdened by regulations, and fee-ridden.\n\nNon-custodial crypto isn’t perfect either though. It comes with its own risks, is difficult, and often requires multiple wallets and tools.\n\nTo solve these problems, the ShapeShift community is focused on building an interface to the decentralized universe that follows each of the following principles:\n\n- Non-custodial/multi-wallet\n- Multi-chain\n- Open source\n- Community-owned\n- Decentralized\n- Free\n\n## How’s 2023 treating you so far? What’s your Q2 plan — any new releases coming soon?\n\nBest year ever so far! Key metrics have been trending up and to the right since December, which is awesome to see in a bear market.\n\nWe have some really exciting updates planned for Q2, including FOX Rewards for users, cross-chain bridging, support for more chains, and displaying DeFi positions, which will make ShapeShift the most comprehensive interface for DeFi users who also hold non-EVM assets like bitcoin, doge, or cosmos assets.\n\nAlso very excited to create a growing list of useful automated wallet notifications with Push protocol and to work with Wherever to deliver native push notifications on smartphones.\n\n## How is ShapeShift using Push’s web3 communication layer?\n\nCurrently ShapeShift uses Push to send governance, wallet, and product notifications to users that subscribe directly from the app. Thanks to the integration with Wherever, ShapeShift now has a notification feed directly in the app where users can not only see ShapeShift notifications, but notifications from all the Push channels they’re subscribed to. Additionally, subscribers can opt in to receiving their Push notifications in email or Telegram. This is important because as a DAO, ShapeShift is seeking alternative ways to communicate with its users that don’t rely on collecting and storing personal identifiable information.\n\n## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\n\nWe’re very excited for p2p wallet chat. We also plan to add more automated notifications in the future, such as news and price notifications for assets you hold as well as notifications for wallet activity on more chains.\n\n## How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\n\nThe Push protocol has worked great at every step of the way, and the team has been incredibly helpful in supporting our integration and launch.\n\n## What haven’t we asked you about that you wish we had?\n\nQ: Wow, how much does ShapeShift charge for all of this?\n\nA: Zero! ShapeShift is an open-source public good :)\n\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\n\n## About ShapeShift\n\nShapeShift is a non-custodial crypto exchange that offers a secure and simple way to trade crypto across multiple blockchains. Currently supporting 11 chains, the DeFi platform also offers various other ways to earn passive income on your crypto assets. ShapeShift’s decentralized and democratic approach to governance empowers its users, making it a truly community-owned platform.\n\nFind out more about ShapeShift: [Website](https://shapeshift.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShapeShift), [Telegram](https://t.me/shapeshiftofficial), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/shapeshift), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ShapeShiftPlatform/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shapeshift_io/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@ShapeShift.com), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrZ2Ml63kLwZJ6amqoGaZeQ)\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n<!--truncate-->\n\nTo fully grasp the concept of push notifications and messages, it is essential to first understand the role of delivery nodes in a communication protocol.\n\nDelivery nodes are endpoints where messages are sent and received. They can be physical devices, applications, or servers and are tasked with relaying messages from one point to another.\n\nIn this blog post, we will explore the various types of delivery nodes and their involvement in push notifications.\n\n## Types of Delivery Nodes in Communication Protocols\n\nDelivery nodes in communication protocols can be classified into the following categories:\n\n- User devices\n- Application servers\n- Message brokers\n- Cloud messaging services\n\n### User Devices:\nUser devices are the most prevalent type of delivery node. These devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers, receive messages from application servers and display them to the user.\n\n### Application Servers:\nApplication servers serve as intermediaries between a user device and the message source, ensuring that messages are delivered to the correct device and that the device can display the message. They perform additional functions such as message processing and storage, and may also provide features like message filtering or user authentication. Application servers are primarily responsible for delivering messages to the intended recipients.\n\n### Message Brokers:\nMessage brokers act as intermediaries between different applications and services, receiving messages from the source and forwarding them to the appropriate destination. They provide a middleware layer that facilitates efficient and reliable message delivery. Unlike application servers, message brokers do not process or store messages, but instead route messages between different applications or services based on their intended destination. They may also perform additional functions like message filtering or message transformation to ensure successful delivery.\n\n### Cloud Messaging Services:\nCloud messaging services are delivery nodes that send push notifications to user devices. These services act as intermediaries between the application server and the user device, processing and delivering messages from the application server to the user device through push notifications.\n\n## The Train Analogy🚂\n\nDelivery nodes in communication protocols can be compared to the different components of a train system.\n\n<b>Cloud messaging services</b> are like the train tracks that connect different destinations. They provide a reliable and efficient route for messages to travel between different devices and services.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Application servers</b> are like the trains that run on the tracks, carrying messages to their intended destinations. They ensure that messages are delivered to the correct device and can be displayed to the user. Application servers also perform additional functions like message processing and storage, as well as providing features like message filtering and user authentication.\n\n<br/><br/><b>Message brokers</b> are like the engines that propel the trains, ensuring they are running efficiently and reliably. The message brokers act as intermediaries between different applications and services, providing a middleware layer that facilitates efficient and reliable message delivery. Message brokers may also perform additional functions like message filtering or message transformation to ensure successful delivery.\n\n<br/><br/><b>User devices</b> are like train destinations, which receive the messages and display them to the users. They are the ultimate destination of the messages, and it is important that they receive the messages in a reliable and efficient manner.\n\nTogether, these delivery nodes work together to enable seamless and secure communication in a communication protocol. By understanding the different roles of each component and how they work together, businesses and organizations can implement effective messaging solutions that meet their specific communication needs.\n\n## Key Features of Push Notifications in Communication Protocols\nPush notifications are a crucial feature of modern communication protocols as they enable real-time updates to be delivered directly to a user’s device even when the application is inactive. To enable push notifications, several key components must work together.\n\n### Cloud Messaging Services for Real-time Push Notifications\nDifferent cloud messaging services are available to enable real-time push notifications in applications. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Apple Push Notification Service (APNS), and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) are some of the popular options that provide similar functionality for sending real-time updates to user devices.\n\n### Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):\nOne popular cloud messaging service is Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), a cross-platform messaging service that supports real-time messaging for Android, iOS, and web applications. FCM is a reliable and efficient way to send push notifications to user devices, making it ideal for applications that require real-time updates.\n\nTo utilize FCM, an application must first integrate the FCM SDK, which provides the required functionality for sending and receiving messages. Once the SDK is integrated, the application can send messages to FCM using the FCM API.\n\nThe FCM API enables applications to send messages to individual devices, groups of devices, or topics. The ‘topics’ feature allows messages to be transmitted to multiple devices subscribed to a specific topic. This simplifies the process of messaging groups of users based on their interests or preferences.\n\nUpon receiving a message, FCM processes and delivers it as a push notification to the user device, which then displays the notification, providing real-time updates.\n\n### Alternative Cloud Messaging Services:\nApart from FCM, other cloud messaging services, such as Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), are available. These services offer similar functionality to FCM, allowing applications to send real-time push notifications to user devices.\n\n## The 5 Core Components of Push Chat\nThe Push Protocol is designed to allow developers to build messaging applications with a highly scalable, secure, and efficient messaging system. It relies on several services that make up the delivery nodes that handle the transmission of messages from sender to receiver.\n\n### 1. Push Tokens Service: Device Token Management\nThe first service in the Push Protocol is the Push Tokens Service. This crucial component is tasked with managing the registration of device tokens and their corresponding wallet addresses. When a user installs a messaging application, the Push Tokens Service generates a unique device token for their device and links it with their wallet address. This information is then stored in a database for future reference.\n\n### 2. Feed Processor Service: Message Payload Distribution\nThe next key service is the Feed Processor Service, which processes incoming feeds containing messages and data (also known as message payloads) along with recipient wallet addresses. This service retrieves the device tokens linked to the recipient wallet addresses from the Push Tokens Service and organizes them into batches based on the messaging platform’s maximum size allowance. Each batch of device tokens and its corresponding message payload are then dispatched to the Push Message Service.\n\n### 3. Push Message Service: Message Transmission\nThe Push Message Service is at the heart of the message transmission process. Upon receiving batches of device tokens and message payloads from the Feed Processor Service, the Push Message Service stores this data in a database. The Push Message Service then processes the messages in batches, forwarding them to the appropriate devices via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).\n\n### 4. FCM Service: Delivering Messages to Devices\nThe FCM Service is responsible for ensuring that messages reach their intended devices. Utilizing the Firebase Cloud Messaging platform, it sends the message payload to the device tokens provided by the Push Message Service. The FCM Service subsequently receives a response from FCM, indicating whether each message was successfully delivered. In a failed delivery, the FCM Service forwards the device token to the Push Tokens Service for removal.\n\n### 5. Authentication Service: Securing Communication\nThe final puzzle piece of the process is the Authentication (Auth) Service. This service generates and administers server tokens to authenticate communication between the various services aforementioned.\n\nFor each wallet address that wants to receive messages, it must first request a token from the Auth Service. The Auth Service then generates a unique server token and associates it with a secret key for that wallet address. This information is stored in a database, and the server token is made available to the other services for authentication purposes when making requests.\n\nWith all these services working together, messages can be sent from one wallet to another through the messaging platform. The Feed Processor Service first processes the message, retrieves the recipient device tokens from the Push Tokens Service, and sends them to the Push Message Service. The Push Message Service then sends the messages to the devices using the FCM Service, which reports whether the message was delivered successfully or not. The Auth Service ensures that communication between the services is secure and authenticated.\n\n## Build With Push Delivery Nodes\n\nTo begin building with Push Delivery Nodes, read up on our documentation specifically for it here:\n\n👉👉👉https://docs.push.org/developers/developer-guides/receiving-notifications/receiving-via-delivery-node\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

Simple. More than that though, the Store Kit enables any dApp store to list every Polygon and EVM dApp, set their own rules for monetization/distribution/curation/governance, brand it as they see fit, and more.\n\ndApp Store Kit stack solves the problem of how Web3 dApps are discovered on mobile devices. For the longest time this has been dominated by centralized stores like Apple and Google. But now, the dApp Store Kit provides an enhanced web3 native alternative that addresses the shortcomings of its web2 counterparts by making dApp store building composable, permissionless, and interoperable.\n\nYou can learn more about the dApp Store Kit and building with it [here](https://docs.dappstorekit.io/docs/start-here).\n\nA closer look at the dApp Store Kit stack — featuring Push as the communication solution.\n\n## How will Push be used?\n\nAs the chosen communications solution, all dApps building with dApp Store Kit will be able to leverage the full array of Push communication products to enhance their user engagement and experience. This includes Push Notifications, Push Chat, and the newly added Push Video!\n\nHere are some possible use cases for Push communication tools within the dApp store:\n\n1. <b>Push Notifications:</b> Dapp store creators can use Push notifications to alert users about new features, updates, or upcoming events. This can increase user engagement and keep users informed about the latest developments in the dApp store.\n2. <b>Instant Chat:</b> Push Protocol’s instant chat feature can be used by dApp store creators to provide customer support to users. This can help to resolve user issues and provide a more personalized experience for users.\n3. <b>Video Chat:</b> Dapp store creators can use Push Protocol’s video chat feature to provide personalized support to users. This can be particularly useful for complex issues that require visual explanations or demonstrations.\n4. <b>Feedback Systems:</b> Push’s communication tools can be used by dApp store creators to collect user reviews and ratings on the dApps they interact with. This can help to improve the quality of the dApps and provide valuable insights to dApp store creators.\n5. <b>Social Features (Group Chat):</b> Push Protocol’s group messaging can be used by dApp store creators to add social features to their dApps, such as chat rooms and forums. This can increase user engagement and create a sense of community within the dApp store.\n\nWhile these are just a few possible integrations, the full breadth of innovation is yet to be discovered as more dApp stores begin building using Push.\n\nWe are excited to be playing a critical role in providing our communication solutions, and hence giving access to an extensive range of new features.\n\n## Excited for the Future of Polygon x Push\n\nAll in all, we believe Push will be a game-changer for dApp store creators.

Push Video is the first wallet-to-wallet video chat that allows web3 users to video chat with each other live. Get started at [app.push.org](https://app.push.org/chat)!\n\nPush Protocol began with push notifications to web3 in January 2022 on Ethereum. Since then, Push has expanded to Polygon and BNB Chain. In October 2022 at Devcon in Bogota, we announced the launch of Push Chat, our wallet-to-wallet messaging protocol. Since launch, Push Protocol has powered over 30M messages to 85,000+ users across 500+ integrations.\n\nBuilt on the success of Push Notifications and Push Chat, we’re now excited to officially release Push Video!\n\nThe web3 social media and chat ecosystem is expanding rapidly today, but Push Video has always been our plan. Back in our [2020 whitepaper](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1590388512280711170?s=20), we referenced that decentralized video chat was on our timeline as a natural component to the web3 communication stack we built, starting with notifications. Also in Bogota, at Polygon Connect, we gave the community a [preview of Push Video](https://twitter.com/harshrajat/status/1579628569453813760?s=20), which was then under development. Between Bogota and today’s announcement, we’ve built off the success of Push Protocol notifications and Push Chat to expand the ecosystem of decentralized social networking.\n\n![Push Video 1](./image-1.png)\n\nWhat can you do with Push Video? Well, anything you do with video today. Social chats, business meetings, customer support, streaming, gaming, telehealth, education and coaching — the list goes on.\n\n### Launching at Pragma Tokyo, ETH Global\n\nBack in 2020, Push Protocol (then, EPNS) was born out of ETHGlobal 2020. Today, we are announcing Push Video during ETHGlobal in Tokyo, at the [Pragma](https://ethglobal.com/events/pragma-tokyo) event.\n\nAfter Push Chat, Push Video is the second major social networking product to be launched by Push Protocol. We will continue to develop these products, adding features like group and streaming. Soon in our roadmap we have web3 “Twitter spaces like experience”, allowing communities to come together on decentralized online forum. All of these products will be tied together by the fundamental notifications layer that we have built and scaled to date. Piece by piece, Push Protocol is building the decentralized social networking ecosystem for all users of the future internet.\n\n### The Push Developer Video SDK\nThe Push Developer Video SDK is launching soon! The SDK will give app developers an easy way to start integrating decentralized notifications, chat, and/or video directly into their applications. We’ll be launching the SDK imminently, so join the #dev-chat channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) to learn more.\n\n### How to Get Started with Push Video?\nSending a video request and getting started with decentralized video chat is easy! Here’s a step by step guide.\n\n<b>Step 1:</b> Head to <a href=\"https://app.push.org/\">app.push.org</a> and connect your MetaMask (or your preferred wallet).<br/><br/>\n\n<b>Step 2:</b> Click on “Push Chat” on the left navigation bar. Search for the recipient you want to video call with their wallet address or their ENS name.*<br/><br/>\n\n![Push Video 2](./image-2.png)\n\n![Push Video 3](./image-3.png)\n\n<b>Step 3:</b> Start a video call using the camera/video icon on the right side of the screen.<br/><br/>\n\n![Push Video 4](./image-4.png)\n\n*Note: You need to be friends prior to making a call. You can do this by starting a text conversation first. Once the other person accepts your message request, you’re all set to have a safe & secure video call.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

Now with Push notifications, Safe users can rest easy knowing they are in complete control and up to date on the status of their assets with real-time notifications to keep them informed.\n\nSafe is a collective asset management platform that provides a secure way for web3 organizations and users to manage their crypto funds. Unlike traditional wallets, Safe is a multi-signature smart contract wallet that allows users to define a list of owner/signer accounts and a threshold number of signers required to confirm a transaction. This feature makes Safe a popular choice for DAOs and other decentralized organizations that require the management of pooled funds.\n\nThe addition of notifications through Push Protocol will enhance the accessibility of transparent infomation tied to the Safe platform. By allowing users to gain real-time insights into the status of their transactions, notifications will enable users to take timely action whenever need be.\n\n## Push X Safe: Empowering Secure Asset Management\n\nAs a trusted decentralized custody protocol, easier transparent communication is now an additional feature Safe users can benefit from. Enhanced by Push, Safe users can feel confident about always being up to date on the state of their assets and transactions.\n\n<blockquote>It is great to see Push protocol integrating with Safe to offer our users another surface to have their pending transaction and signature notifications. We want to make smart account usability be akin to the simplicity of web2 and communication will play a part in that. — Lukas Schor, Co-founder of Safe</blockquote>\n\nBy opting in to Push notifications, Safe users can be notified of any pending signatures or executions of all the safes in a particular wallet address. Push is looking forward to exploring new ways to enhance the Safe UX with notifications and are excited for what’s to come.\n\n<blockquote>“We’re excited to see these pending transaction notifications take effect and similarly excited to explore additional opportunities for using web3 communication to enhance Safe’s UX” — Harsh Rajat, Push Protocol CEO & Co-founder</blockquote>\n\nIt’s Push’s goal that this collaboration with Safe will showcase a way in which web3 organizations and individuals can better monitor their crypto assets.\n\nWe’re excited to be working alongside the Safe team and paving the way for a safer and more decentralized future.\n\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\n\n## About Safe\n\nSafe (previously Gnosis Safe) is a on-chain asset custody protocol, securing ~$40 Billion in assets today. It is establishing a universal ‘smart account’ standard for secure custody of digital assets, data, and identity. With Safe{Wallet}, it’s flagship web and mobile wallet and Safe{Core} account abstraction infrastructure, it is on a mission to unlock digital ownership for everyone in web3 including DAOs, enterprises, retail and institutional users.\n\nFind all about it: [Website](https://safe.global/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/safe), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nrQVY2566v), [Blog](https://safe.mirror.xyz/), [GitHub](https://github.com/safe-global), [Docs](https://docs.safe.global/)\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n<!--truncate-->\n\n<!--customheaderpoint-->\n# How Push Protocol can be leveraged to maximize community participation and enhance organizations that rely on decentralized governance.<br/>\n\nPush Protocol is ushering in a new era of sophisticated web3 middleware. We’re enabling a more efficient, effective, and democratic decentralized ecosystem.\n\nAs the backbone for communication and an essential layer of web3 infrastructure, Push Protocol streamlines decentralized coordination and elevates web3 governance structures. From seasoned web3 experts to those just beginning their journey into the decentralized world, Push Protocol is an indispensable tool for anyone looking to build and participate in the web3 ecosystem. Push is poised to be a driving force in the future of decentralized systems by enabling frictionless and permissionless collaboration, decision-making, and innovation.\n\nPush Protocol’s robust and flexible utility empowers developers to break free from the constraints of traditional web2 infrastructure. This infrastructure is often relied on for web3-based systems. Through our web3 tools, developers can now create innovative applications and governance structures that tackle the coordination problem in web3.\n\nWith its expansive array of possibilities, Push invites developers to bring the web3 vision to life through custom, creative solutions that deliver on the full potential of decentralized systems.\n\nLet’s explore some examples.\n\n## Enabling Real-Time Communication Between DAOs\n\nPush Protocol revolutionizes communication within the web3 ecosystem, including between DAOs. With the innovative Push Chat and Protocol features, DAOs can incorporate Push to communicate and make decisions in real time, elevating their coordination and decision-making processes. This allows stakeholders in multiple projects and developers working in one or various ecosystems to collaborate and connect seamlessly and efficiently through their associated DAOs, truly scaling the development and building processes within the web3 space.\n\nAnd it’s not just DAOs that benefit — other agents in the web3 ecosystem can participate in discussions directly from their wallets or dapps, bridging the gap and fostering seamless collaboration.\n\n## Breaking Down Barriers to New Solutions\n\nAs we’ve outlined, the current web2 communication infrastructure is centralized and controlled by a few large corporations, resulting in censorship, data privacy breaches, and a lack of transparency. Push Protocol solves these issues by providing a decentralized communication layer controlled by the community. Its open-source codebase and IP program guarantee that the protocol evolves transparently and democratically, with the community having the final say on any changes or improvements.\n\nMoreover, Push Protocol provides a range of tools for developers to build and customize their solutions, including the Push Chat, which enables real-time communication, and the Push-SDK, which offers a range of functionality for building and integrating with the protocol. Additionally, Push Protocol provides seamless integration with other web3 technologies, such as Ethereum and Polygon, making it an invaluable addition to any web3 development stack.\n\nWith all this in mind, there are many ways that the governing of this model can be improved, which includes communication directly to interested users and notifications on important updates and changes, web3 style!\n\n## Unlocking Next-Generation Governance Structures\n\nIncorporating a decentralized communication layer like Push Protocol in web3 infrastructure is the key to unlocking next-generation governance structures. The ability for DAOs and other actors in the web3 ecosystem to communicate and coordinate seamlessly opens up new possibilities for improving and refining existing governance structures. From upgrading voting mechanisms to enhancing ownership and communication processes, the introduction of Push Protocol will allow web3 governance-based systems to scale and evolve in ways never before seen.\n\n## Pushing the Limits of Improvement Proposals\n\nPush Protocol’s Improvement Proposal program, PIP or Push Improvement Proposals, provides a transparent and open forum for stakeholders to submit proposals for improvements and changes to the protocol. Like the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) program and other DAO-facilitated programs, such as the Polygon DAO and Uniswap DAO, the PIP program ensures that Push Protocol stays at the forefront of the web3 landscape, continuously evolving and improving to meet the community’s needs.\n\nHowever, most improvement proposal programs rely on a subset of web2-based technology and communication channels. By providing a decentralized communication layer for DAOs, Push Protocol is taking the next step in scaling improvement proposals, enabling stakeholders, whether they are users, developers, investors, etc., to coordinate robustly across different improvement proposals.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

The Push DAO has ratified the proposal to implement Push Protocol’s Bug Bounty Program🎉\n\n<b>And the program starts TODAY!</b>\n\n## How the Program works\n\nThe Program is structured to be as streamlined as possible by following just 3 steps:\n\n- <b>Step 1:</b> Security researchers will submit their findings through the Official Form available <a href=\"https://zv9atndluia.typeform.com/to/KW3gwclM\"><b>here</b></a>.\n- <b>Step 2:</b> Designated Push Team members will review security vulnerabilities, analyze the report, and classify it according to severity.\n- <b>Step 3:</b> The Push team will follow up with the reporter with results in no more than 1 week.\n\nThe program includes 4 levels of severity on its scale:\n\n- <b>Critical Issues</b> — have a serious and immediate impact in the protocol functioning and could impact numerous users. An example would be preventing notifications and/or chat from being sent, or affectation to fees collected through the protocol.\n- <b>High Issues</b> — pose severe risks to individual users or Push’s partners.\n- <b>Medium Issues</b> — where the risk is relatively small and does not jeopardize users/protocols that interact with Push.\n- <b>Low/Informational Issues</b> — do not pose an immediate risk but are relevant to security best practices.\n\nRewards will be given based on the classification of the bug’s severity, as well as the likelihood of the bug being triggered or exploited. This is to be determined at the sole discretion of the Push Protocol team.\n\n## Eligibility requirements\n\nTo be eligible for a reward, you must comply with all the eligibility requirements of the Program outlined below.\n\n- Discover a previously unreported, unknown, non-public vulnerability to the team which is within the scope of this Program.\n- Be the first to disclose the unique vulnerability — via the form that will be made available after this proposal is ratified, in compliance with the disclosure requirements.\n- Provide sufficient information to enable our engineers to reproduce the vulnerability and fix it.\n- Not exploit the vulnerability in any way. This includes sharing the vulnerability with others and/or by obtaining an additional reward, other than a reward under this Program.\n- Not publicize the vulnerability in any way, other than private reporting to us.\n- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, interruption or degradation of any of the assets in scope.\n- Not submit a vulnerability caused by an underlying issue that is the same as an issue previously reported and paid out by the Program.\n- Not engage in any unlawful conduct when disclosing the bug. This includes threats, demands, or any other coercive tactics.\n- Be at least 18 years of age. If younger, submit note of the vulnerability along with written consent of your parent or guardian.\n- Not be a current or former Push team member, vendor or contractor who has been involved in the development of the code of the bug in question.\n\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\n\nThe Push DAO Bug Bounty Program will be managed in epochs of <b>3 months</b> (officially starting on day 1 of each quarter).\n\nFund allocation per epoch may vary according to market conditions. Despite this, Push DAO will always ensure some extent of funding is allocated to sustain rewards for contributors.\n\nThis newfound Bug Bounty Program adds to our long string of initiatives that aim to foster and encourage community participation.\n\nWe look forward to seeing your contributions and support in making Push as great a protocol as possible!\n\n## Got questions?\n\nYou can reach out to us through any of our communication channels, however we suggest Discord as the initial point to start conversations and ask questions regarding vulnerabilities found.\n\nYou can find us on [Discord here](https://discord.com/invite/pushprotocol).\n\nThanks again for being a part of what makes Push Protocol incredible!\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n<!--truncate-->\n\nThe ability to communicate effectively with users is a crucial aspect of any decentralized application or service. This is where communication channels come in. Serving as a bridge between dapps and users, enabling notifications, chat messages and other forms of communication across various blockchain networks.\n\nIn this article we will dive deeper into the concept of communication channels, their evolution in the current web, and how Push Protocol is being used to improve this communication process.\n\n## What Are Communication Channels?\nA communication channel is a virtual connection that enables the exchange of information between two or more entities. In the current web, communication channels are typically software-based programs or services that facilitate the exchange of messages, images, files, or other forms of data between users.\n\nCommunication channels have been a crucial part of the web since its inception. In the era of Web2, communication channels are ubiquitous and enable us to communicate with our friends, family, and colleagues in real-time. Examples of communication channels in the current web include messaging apps, social media platforms, email, and video conferencing tools like Telegram and Zoom.\n\nCommunication channels in Web2 can be divided into two categories: synchronous and asynchronous.\n\n<b>Synchronous</b> communication channels refer to real-time communication between two or more individuals. The most common examples of synchronous communication channels include phone calls, instant messaging, and video conferencing. These channels allow people to communicate with each other in real-time.\n\n<b>Asynchronous</b> communication channels on the other hand, refers to communication that doesn’t require real-time interactions. The most common examples of asynchronous communication channels include email, social media, and forums. These channels allow people to communicate with each other at their own convenience.\n\nIn Web2, communication channels have been used by businesses to improve customer engagement and provide better customer service. For instance, businesses can use email or social media to inform customers about product updates, promotions, and special offers. They can also use messaging apps and chatbots to provide customer support and resolve issues in real-time.\n\nIn Web3, communication channels have a similar function but operate on different infrastructures. Instead of relying on centralized servers, Web3 communication channels are built on decentralized networks, such as the Ethereum blockchain. These channels allow dapps, wallets, and services to send notifications, chat messages, and other forms of communication to their users on various blockchain networks.\n\nAt a technical level, a communication channel in Web3 typically involves the creation of a smart contract on the blockchain. The smart contract acts as an intermediary between the dapp, wallet, or service and its users, enabling messages to be sent back and forth. These messages can be encrypted to provide an additional layer of security and privacy.\n\n## Push Protocol and Communication Channels\nWithin Push Protocol, a communication channel is a service via smart contracts that facilitates messaging and notifications for Web3 users. These communication channels enable dApps, protocols, or even Web2 services to send messages to subscribers directly linked to their wallet addresses. Communication channels are designed to be chain-agnostic, meaning that they can deliver messages on any network of choice.\n\nPush Protocol allows for both general chat and notifications. Users can restrict receiving notifications only from specific channels to ensure they only receive messages from approved senders. Users can opt in or out of the channels they are interested in without incurring transaction fees. The communication channels are also spam resistant and ensure that subscribers only receive messages relevant to them. This is accomplished through smart message filtering, ensuring that users only receive notifications that are relevant to their interests.\n\n## Creating a Communication Channel\nCreating a communication channel on Push Protocol is a simple process that can be done using the Push dapp or smart contracts. To set up a channel, you will need the following:\n\n- A channel name\n- A channel logo (an image of size 128px * 128px)\n- An amount of 50 $PUSH tokens in your wallet (and some ETH)\n- A brief channel description (250 characters)\n- Channel CTA (call-to-action link)\n- Network & Alias address\n\nOnce you have created a channel on the compatible blockchain, you can enable it on other blockchain networks, such as Binance Chain (BNB).\n\n## BNB Chain (Binance Channel Setup)\nWith the recent Binance Chain (BNB) deployment, let’s look at how you can create a communication channel that seamlessly communicates with users on the BNB network.\n\nYou must complete two straightforward steps to set up a channel alias address for the Binance Chain. First, select the Binance Chain and provide the correct alias address for the channel during its creation. Second, you need to verify the alias address on the Binance Chain.\n\nIt’s essential to note that the alias verification procedure is part of the channel creation process, and verification must occur on the selected chain. This procedure ensures that the alias address provided during channel creation actually belongs to the channel owner. Once the verification is complete, the channel owner can use their alias address to communicate with subscribers on the Binance Chain.\n\nIn practice, the verification process involves\n\n- Logging into the dApp with the same address provided as the Alias Address during channel creation\n- Navigating to the Create Channel menu\n- Clicking the <b>Verify Alias Address</b> button\n\nOnce the verification transaction is approved on the Binance Chain, the alias address is successfully verified on the Binance Chain and linked with the Ethereum network channel. The channel owner can access their channel profile page and send notifications from the Binance Chain using their alias address.\n\nIt’s worth noting that delegate addresses are also useful for ensuring notifications can be sent out from wallets other than the one that created the channel. The channel creator is the only person able to add or remove delegates at any time. The communication channels’ chat feature also allows users to whitelist addresses, block addresses, and prevent spam messages. These features help ensure that communication channels remain secure and relevant to their subscribers.\n\nTo learn more about Channel Aliases and Delegates, you can refer to [Push documentation here](https://docs.push.org/developers/concepts/create-your-notif-channel/what-is-a-channel-alias).\n\n## Conclusion\nCommunication channels play a crucial role in enabling decentralized applications and services to communicate with their users. Push Protocol offers a chain-agnostic solution that enables communication across ecosystems and networks. Following the straightforward steps outlined in this section, you can easily set up a communication channel on one of the compatible chains and communicate seamlessly.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.gif)\n<!--truncate-->\n\nFirst-principle thinking means breaking down a complex problem into its most basic, foundational elements.\n\nOne example of applying First-principle thinking is Richard Feynman’s (an American theoretical physicist) famous essay that starts with basic algebra such as addition and subtraction and explains calculus in just [four pages](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_22.html) through fully connected coherent reasoning.\n\n![Reasoning](./image-1.png)\n\nWith that, let’s explore the Push Protocol by applying First Principle Thinking:\n\n## The Internet.\nThe internet is a global network of computers and devices connected by a set of standardized communication protocols. These protocols define how information is transmitted across the network, including how data is encoded, transmitted, and received.\n\nThese devices are connected together through a variety of wired and wireless connections, including fiber optic cables, copper wires, and radio waves.\n\nThe internet is based on a set of standard protocols, including TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which define how data is transmitted across the network. This creates a foundation for how data is broken down into packets, how those packets are addressed and routed across the network, and how they are reassembled into a complete message at the destination.\n\nThese protocols allow computers and devices to communicate with each other regardless of their location or type. They also provide a foundation for a wide range of applications and services, including email, web browsing, social networking, and online commerce.\n\n## How the Internet got Centralized.\nThe internet started out as a decentralized network, with no central authority in control. However, over time, the internet has become increasingly centralized as companies and organizations have gained more power and control over critical aspects of the network.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this centralization is the growth of large internet service providers (ISPs) and content providers. These companies have become dominant players in the online ecosystem, controlling vast amounts of data and traffic, and using their power to influence how the internet is used and accessed.\n\nAnother factor contributing to centralization is the development of proprietary technologies and platforms that are controlled by a few large companies. For example, many people use Google’s search engine, Facebook’s social media platform, and Amazon’s Web Service, which all operate on proprietary technology that is controlled by those companies.\n\nIn addition, there are certain technical limitations of the internet itself that can contribute to centralization. For example, the Domain Name System (DNS), which is used to translate domain names into IP addresses, is controlled by a small number of organizations, making it a point of centralization.\n\n## The Blockchain.\nA blockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger that is used to record transactions or information in a secure and transparent manner.\n\nAt its core, a blockchain consists of a network of computers that work together to validate and record each transaction. Each transaction is added to a basic containers of information in a blockchain which are known as block, which is then added to the existing chain of blocks, creating an immutable and transparent ledger that is visible to all participants in the network.\n\nThe security of a blockchain is achieved through the use of cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms. Each transaction is encrypted and validated by multiple participants in the network, using a consensus mechanism such as proof of work or proof of stake. Once validated, the transaction is added to the blockchain and cannot be altered or deleted.\n\n## The Need for Decentralized Communication Protocols\n\n![Need for decentralized](./image-2.png)\n\nDecentralized communication protocols on the blockchain offer several benefits that traditional centralized communication systems cannot provide. Here are some of the reasons why a decentralized communication protocol on the blockchain is needed:\n\n- <b>Security:</b> Decentralized communication protocols on the blockchain are more secure as they use cryptography and peer-to-peer networking to ensure that messages are transmitted securely and cannot be intercepted or tampered with by third parties. In contrast, centralized communication systems are vulnerable to hacking, data breaches, and other security threats.\n- <b>Privacy:</b> Decentralized communication protocols on blockchain offer greater privacy as they do not require users to provide personal information to a centralized authority. This helps to protect users’ privacy.\n- <b>Censorship resistance:</b> Decentralized communication protocols on blockchain are resistant to censorship as there is no centralized authority that can control or censor the flow of information. This helps to ensure that people can communicate freely without fear of censorship or repression.\n- <b>Ownership and control:</b> Decentralized communication protocols on blockchain give users ownership and control over their data and communications. In contrast, centralized communication systems often collect and use user data for commercial or other purposes without their consent.\n\nOverall, a decentralized communication protocol on blockchain is needed to provide greater security, privacy, censorship resistance, ownership, control, and transparency than traditional centralized communication systems. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, decentralized communication protocols can help to create a more open, secure, and democratic internet for everyone.\n\n## The Push Protocol\nPush protocol is a decentralized communication protocol. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services through an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic mechanism.\n\nThis means that different applications and services can communicate with each other in a secure and open way, regardless of the blockchain platform they are built on.\n\nThe Push protocol provides an open communication layer that allows any crypto wallet/frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across. This can help to improve the interoperability and usability of decentralized applications and services in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nPush has empowered the web3 space by delivering 25 million+ notifications, 70k+ subscribers, and over 150 integrations so far.\n\n![Ecosystem](./image-3.png)\n<center>The Push Ecosystem</center>\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

You can enter a challenge to increase your savings, and earn NFTs, badges, and a spot on the leaderboard. But that’s not all. You can create and vote on challenges of your choice as you watch your savings grow.\n\nSay goodbye to dull financial management and hello to HaloFi.\n\nFor a DeFi platform like HaloFi, it’s critical to keep users informed so they don’t miss out on new challenges or lose track of their savings journey. This is where Push comes in. With Push, HaloFi can easily notify users when a new challenge is launched, ensuring they never miss out on any exciting opportunities to save and earn rewards.\n\nIn this episode of “Frens of Push”, we are in conversation with [Rachel](https://twitter.com/RachBLondon) from HaloFi to talk about how HaloFi is progressing on its mission to enable easy personal financial management and how Push protocol is helping.\n\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\n\n## Hi Rachel, how did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What’s your story?\nI became involved in building in the blockchain space back in 2017 when I was working as a developer. At first, I didn’t really understand blockchain, but that all changed after I spoke to someone at a hackathon who told me “bitcoin has never been hacked.” That statement sent me down the rabbit hole, and I started to learn some Solidity and explore the technology more. This newfound interest ultimately led me to change jobs and start working in developer relations for a protocol. That all happened in 2017/8 and since then I have been working full-time in the industry. That’s the short version of my story!\n\n## Tell us about HaloFi — what’s it about, and what problem does HaloFi solve?\nHaloFi is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that was first conceptualized in early 2020. While there are many DeFi protocols in the market, HaloFi addresses the issue of accessibility by making it easy for everyday people to save and build their personal wealth. Originally called GoodGhosting, the name was coined during an ETH London Hackathon at 4am, we recently rebranded to HaloFi. But our mission of helping people become their best financial selves, stays.\n\n![Dashboard](./image-1.jpg)\n\nWithin our app, users can join “Saving” or “Hold” challenges, which require them to make regular deposits or hold their tokens for the long term. If users meet these goals, they are rewarded with additional returns from DeFi protocols, badges, and other incentives. Overall, HaloFi aims to make saving and building wealth accessible and fun for everyone. We are bringing gamification to DeFi personal finance.\n\n## What’s your 2023 plan for you and your team?\nWe recently rebranded, and alongside this launched a suite of new features; badges, leaderboards, shareable profile pages, fiat on and off ramps, and bridging solutions. We will be building on these to make HaloFi even more accessible, fun, and engaging. Ultimately we want to be the place where people start their DeFi journey. I can’t mention specifics, but there will be a lot in the pipeline.\n\n## How is HaloFi using Push’s web3 communication layer?\nWe are currently using Push to notify users when a new challenge launches, this means anyone using Push can be one of the first to be notified. Meaning you won’t miss a tasty challenge or end up FOMOing.\n\nLet us know if you are using Push and HaloFi, as we have a number of additional integrations that are possible, but we want to make it work with how users are using both our product and Push. The possibilities of a crypto-native messaging layer are huge!\n\n## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\nThere are many! Aside from additional information about transactions, i.e. Venmoing crypto, Push could be one of the main social messaging platform, since we all now have wallet’s it makes very good sense to build more social applications on top of these. For DAOs, this also has the benefit of more identity security. We’ve seen time and time again how dangerous malicious impersonations can be. It think it’s important we build secure and web3 native infra structure to solve this.\n\n## How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\nPush is a great tool for updating our community of new challenges, updates to our product and other news. It feels great to not have to rely on third party email or text solution, which sometimes can cut you out without notice. Ultimately Push is a great community building tool.\n\n## What do you do if you’re not working?\nRollerskating! This has been my latest hobby and it’s a great way to switch off, whilst being tons of fun. Aside from that travel, but I have to be honest, web3 and crypto takes up a lot of my time!\n\n## What haven’t we asked you about that you wish we had?\nSomething that is important to me is how can we make web3 tech more accessible. We think about this alot at HaloFi, and I’m sure you also do at Push. Personally I’m very excited to see the developments in account abstraction, as wallet UX has always been a pain. However I also think it’s important to build apps that people want to use, and can understand. We saw in 2021 how explosive the growth of NFTs was. In DeFi there is a need for easy to understand, accessible applications. We are working on this daily at HaloFi.\n\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center><br/>\n\nFor HaloFi users, the Push channel is LIVE.

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n<!--truncate-->\n\nBlockchain technology has come a long way since the advent of Bitcoin in 2009. Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms with unique features, capabilities, and ecosystems.\n\nWith that, the need for interoperability between these different platforms has been a major challenge for blockchain technology’s growth and mass adoption. As such, cross-chain solutions have become essential to enable seamless interaction between different blockchain platforms though they still lack a critical component — communication.\n\nThis is where the Push Protocol comes into play.\n\n## What is Cross-Chain?\nCross-chain refers to the ability of different blockchain platforms to communicate and interact. In other words, cross-chain technology enables the transfer of assets, data, and additional information between different blockchain platforms.\n\nThis opens up a world of possibilities for blockchain technology, as it allows for the creation of dApps that can operate across multiple blockchain platforms without being limited by the constraints of a single platform.\n\n## What’s the difference between Cross-Chain and Multichain?\nMultichain technology refers to creating an internet of blockchains, where blockchains can communicate freely while remaining secure. This is achieved through a shared underlying security layer that connects the different blockchain platforms.\n\nOn the other hand, cross-chain technology uses smart contracts to create synthetic versions of coins that can interact with other blockchains directly. In other words, multichain is about connecting blockchains, while cross-chain is about connecting assets and data across blockchains.\n\n## Recap on Interoperability\nInteroperability is the ability of different systems to work together seamlessly. In the context of blockchain technology, interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain platforms to communicate and interact with each other. This is critical for the growth and mass adoption of blockchain technology, as it enables the creation of dApps that can operate across multiple blockchain platforms, providing users with more options and greater flexibility.\n\n## Push Protocol: Communication for Cross-Chain\nPush Protocol is the missing piece of Web3, filling the gap in critical infrastructure that has been holding back the growth and mass adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nUntil now, there was no solution to enable native communication between wallets in response to on and off-chain data. This has created a fractured dApp ecosystem held together by antiquated and centralized communication platforms. Push Protocol is building the communication network for Web3, addressing this gap and improving the everyday experience for blockchain users.\n\nPush Protocol adds the necessary middleware to achieve interoperability by providing a communication layer for cross-chain interoperability. This is especially important now, as the infrastructure layer is still being built and designed, not necessarily for the “ideal end product.”\n\n## The Solution to the Problems of Cross-Chain Solutions\nImagine a future where cross-chain solutions can communicate with each other seamlessly, either autonomously or manually, sending out necessary notifications to indicate specific events. This opens up a world of possibilities and creates a more secure environment for users.\n\nWith the use of Push Protocol, cross-chain solutions can effectively communicate with each other, allowing for the implementation of fallbacks and fail-safes. This means that in the event of a security breach or other blockchain-related incident, these systems can automatically take effect, protecting users and their assets.\n\nBy having a native communication layer in the form of Push Protocol, cross-chain solutions can be made more resilient and safe, preventing terrible incidents such as hacking and the loss of funds without the ability to act.\n\n## The Need for Cross-Chain UX in Web3\nThere is often talk about the idea of the “super dApp” or the “universal dApp” in the blockchain and Web3 space. But, real-time communication, which is a fundamental aspect of the internet as we know it, is often not a part of this equation. This can lead to a fragmented user experience for blockchain users who constantly shift between dApps and blockchain networks.\n\nPush Protocol addresses this issue by revolutionizing the user experience in Web3. It brings the necessary real-time communication found in today’s internet to the decentralized and distributed world of Web3. By providing this missing piece of the puzzle, Push Protocol makes cross-chain communication possible and improves the overall user experience for blockchain users.\n\nIn conclusion, cross-chain communication is a critical component of the Web3 ecosystem, and Push Protocol provides the necessary middleware to make interoperability a reality. With its focus on improving the UX in Web3, Push Protocol is poised to play a vital role in shaping the future of the decentralized world.\n\nIf you’re curious to learn more about how Push Protocol’s interoperability works and how you can enable cross-chain communication, come read more in our documentation👉 [right here](https://docs.push.org/developers/developer-guides/create-your-notif-channel/enabling-channel-on-other-chains).\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.gif)\n<!--truncate-->\n\nDevelopers and researchers in computer networks are constantly seeking ways to improve messaging systems’ security, reliability, and scalability. Why? Because traditional centralized messaging systems have their drawbacks, including vulnerabilities to hacks, censorship and the risk of downtime.\n\nThat’s where decentralized messaging protocols come in. Decentralized protocols use blockchain technology and decentralized networks to create a more secure and resilient messaging infrastructure.\n\nWhile we’ve already looked deeper into how [Push Chat](https://medium.com/push-protocol/were-still-pushing-a-deeper-look-into-push-chat-90fdea8d9e8e) works, we now want to see where it fits in the grand scheme of things. To start with, let’s take a step back and examine how traditional chat applications work.\n\n## An Overview of Traditional Chat Applications\nMost traditional chat applications use a client-server model, where the client (e.g., a mobile app or desktop software) communicates with a central server to send and receive messages. The server acts as a mediator, routing messages between clients and storing them in a database.\n\nThis model has some advantages, such as the ability to support many users and the convenience of storing messages in a centralized location. However, it also has its drawbacks. The server is a single point of failure, meaning that if it goes down, the entire chat system becomes unavailable. Additionally, the server has complete control over the messages, which means it can censor or alter them if it chooses to. Not to mention, the ethos of web3 has shown us that distributing and decentralizing methods of communication is a logical next step to drive humanity forward.\n\n## An Example with Discord\nIn the traditional client-server model of chat applications, such as Discord, messages are typically stored on the central server in a database. When a user sends a message on a Discord channel, it is sent from the user’s client to the Discord server over a network connection using a transport protocol, such as HTTP or WebSocket. The server then routes the message to the intended recipient and stores it in the database.\n\nIn the case of Discord, if the recipient has enabled push notifications, the server will send a push notification to the recipient’s device when a new message is received (we explained this scenario in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/push-protocol/my-app-would-like-to-send-you-push-notifications-4b591a68f803\"><b>’My App’ Would Like to Send You Push Notifications blog post.)</b></a> The message is delivered directly from the server to the recipient’s account when the recipient is online and has the Discord application open on their device. If the recipient is not online or has the application closed, the message is stored on the server until the recipient becomes available.\n\nThis process allows for real-time communication between users and the ability to receive notifications even when the app is not open. However, it also relies on a central server to route messages and sends notifications, which can be vulnerable to outages and censorship. It is worth noting that the specifics of how messages are stored and transmitted may vary depending on the particular chat application and implementation.\n\n## Our Answer to These Problems? Push Chat.\nPUSHing the standards of communication started with EPNS, which transformed in Push Protocol. But Push Protocol on it’s own doesn’t add value to the user nor the dApp, hence, we created a host of communication solutions to be used for real-life applications.\n\nWith an endless number of use cases, some of which high impact areas right now that Push can revolutionize are:\n\n- Wallet  &lt; &gt; dApp communication\n- Wallet  &lt; &gt; Wallet communication\n- Off-chain or private marketplace communication\n- META communication in the metaverse\n- Off-chain games and gamified events communication\n\nPush Chat’s potential doesn’t end there. It also has the potential to encourage the development of new communication primitives in the web3 space. Providing a secure and reliable messaging infrastructure opens the door for developers to create innovative solutions for messaging and communication that were not previously possible.\n\nCome explore Push Chat and see for yourself!\n\n👉👉👉 https://app.push.org/#/chat\n\n## An example of Governance: Disconnected Autonomous Organizations\nAs the decentralized ecosystem grows, so does the need for effective communication between decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and their users. Unfortunately, the current communication state in the space leaves much to be desired.\n\nCentralized tools dominate the space, requiring users to give up some level of their privacy and personal identity to participate. This can be a significant barrier for many, especially in cryptocurrency and blockchain, where anonymity is highly valued.\n\nPush Chat offers a solution to this problem, providing a decentralized communication layer for web3. With Push Chat, DAOs and their users can communicate with each other in a secure, anonymous, and censorship-resistant manner.\n\nUsing the power of peer-to-peer networks, Push Chat allows users to send messages directly to each other without the need for a central server. This enhances privacy and security and makes the system more resistant to censorship. But Push Chat isn’t just a messaging platform — it also enables censorship-resistant, decentralized polling and voting on proposals submitted on the blockchain. [With our generalized SDK (docs)](https://docs.push.org/developers/concepts/push-chat-for-web3), you can use Push Chat for decentralization, security, and significantly lower costs in gas for you and your users.\n\nWhether voting on proposals, collaborating on projects, or just keeping in touch with fellow community members, Push Chat provides a powerful and easy-to-use solution for decentralized communication.\n\nPush Chat can even broadcast user transactions to a network of sequencers, where sequencers compete to include transactions, further decentralizing cryptocurrency infrastructure.\n\nWhether you’re building a social network, a platform for collaborating on the artwork, open-source software, or any other type of dApp, Push Chat can provide a decentralized, private, censorship-resistant, and user-friendly experience for communication and collaboration. And with its ability to save gas fees through transaction aggregation, Push Chat can enhance the decentralization and ease of running your dApp or protocol, allowing users to submit their own transactions or creating a decentralized architecture that handles this for them.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

With this API, you can easily subscribe to real-time notifications and updates from the Push network.\n\nIn this article, we’ll go over the PUSH-SDK Socket API and how to use it in your dApp.\n\n## Note on Addresses\nIn any of the specified methods (unless explicitly stated otherwise), you can use either CAIP format (specifically CAIP-10) or the ETH address format.\n\nRecall that CAIP, or Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal, is a way to describe standards for blockchain projects that are not specific to a single chain. It was developed by the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process and is used to identify and encode information about Ethereum addresses, contract addresses, and other crypto-assets. For example, an ETH mainnet address would be in the form:\n\n<b>eip155:1:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb</b><br/><br/>\n\n<blockquote>The sockets API uses CAIP-10 (but defaults to the Ethereum address format), which is a specific proposal within the CAIP specification that focuses on the identification of blockchain addresses. It defines a format for representing addresses in a way that is both chain-agnostic and human-readable.</blockquote>\n\nThe ETH address format is supported for backwards compatibility. For example, an ETH mainnet address would be in the form <b>0xab16a96d359ec26a11e</b>\n\n## Creating a Socket Connection\n\nTo create a socket connection, you’ll need to create a socket connection object.\n\n```js\ncreateSocketConnection(options: SocketConnectionOptions): SocketConnection\n```\n\nYou can use the <b>createSocketConnection</b> method to create a socket connection object. This method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\n\n- <b>user</b> (<b>string</b>, required): The user account address, in <a href=\"https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md#test-cases\">CAIP</a> format.\n- <b>env</b> (<b>string</b>, optional, default: <b>'prod'</b>): The API environment to connect to. Can be <b>'prod'</b>, <b>'staging'</b>, or <b>'dev'</b>.\n- <b>socketOptions</b> (<b>object</b>, optional): Options to pass to <a href=\"https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-options/\">SocketIO</a>.\n\nThis method returns a <b>SocketConnection</b> object that you can use to connect, disconnect, and subscribe to events.\n\n## For Notifications\nTo create a socket connection for notifications, you’ll need to create a socket connection object.\n\n```js\nconst pushSDKSocket = createSocketConnection({\nuser: 'eip155:5:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb', // CAIP-10 format\nenv: 'staging',\nsocketOptions: { autoConnect: false }\n});\n```\n\n## For Push Chat\nTo create a socket connection for chat, you should define the socket type as “chat” when instantiating the socket client. The user address can be in any format, including non-CAIP-10 formats.\n\n```js\nconst pushSDKSocket = createSocketConnection({\n user: '0xFd6C2fE69bE13d8bE379CCB6c9306e74193EC1A9',\n env: 'staging',\n apiKey: 'jVPMCRom1B.iDRMswdehJG7NpHDiECIHwYMMv6k2KzkPJscFIDyW8TtSnk4blYnGa8DIkfuacU0',\n socketType: 'chat',\n socketOptions: { autoConnect: true, reconnectionAttempts: 3 }\n});\n```\n\nThis method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\n\n- <b>user</b> (<b>string</b>, required): The user account address.\n- <b>env</b> (<b>string</b>, optional, default: <b>'prod'</b>): The API environment to connect to. Can be <b>'prod'</b>, <b>'staging'</b>, or <b>'dev'</b>.\n- <b>apiKey</b> (<b>string</b>, optional): The API key to use for authentication.\n- <b>socketType</b> (<b>string</b>, optional, default: <b>'notification'</b>): The type of socket connection to create. Can be <b>'notification'</b> or <b>'chat'</b>.\n- <b>socketOptions</b> (<b>object</b>, optional): Options to pass to <a href=\"https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-options/\">SocketIO</a>.\n\nThis method returns a <b>SocketConnection</b> object that you can use to connect, disconnect, and subscribe to events.\n\n## Connecting and Disconnecting\nOnce you have a <b>SocketConnection</b> object, you can use the <b>connect</b> and <b>disconnect</b> methods to establish or close the connection:\n\n```js\nSocketConnection.connect(): void\n```\n\nUse the <b>connect</b> method to establish a connection to the backend.\n\n```js\nSocketConnection.disconnect(): void\n```\n\nUse the <b>disconnect</b> method to close the connection to the backend.\n\n## Subscribing to Events\n\nOnce you have a connection, you can subscribe to events to receive updates in real-time.\n\n```js\nSocketConnection.on(event: SocketEvent, callback: (data: any) => void): \n```\n\nUse the <b>on</b> method to subscribe to a socket event. This method takes an event name and a callback function as arguments. The callback function will be called whenever the specified event is triggered.\n\nThe following events are supported:\n\n- <b>EVENTS.CONNECT:</b> Triggered when the socket connection is established.\n- <b>EVENTS.DISCONNECT:</b> Triggered when the socket connection is closed.\n- <b>EVENTS.USER_FEEDS:</b> Triggered when a new notification is received by the user after the last socket connection.\n- <b>EVENTS.USER_SPAM_FEEDS:</b> Triggered when a new spam notification is received by the user after the last socket connection.\n- <b>EVENTS.CHAT_RECEIVED_MESSAGE:</b> Triggered when a new chat message is received.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst pushSDKSocket = createSocketConnection({\n user: 'eip155:5:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb',\n env: 'staging',\n socketOptions: { autoConnect: false }\n});\npushSDKSocket.connect();\npushSDKSocket.on(EVENTS.CONNECT, () => {\n console.log('Connected to socket!');\n});\npushSDKSocket.on(EVENTS.DISCONNECT, () => {\n console.log('Disconnected from socket!');\n});\npushSDKSocket.on(EVENTS.USER_FEEDS, (feedItem) => {\n console.log(`Received notification: ${feedItem.title}`);\n});\npushSDKSocket.on(EVENTS.USER_SPAM_FEEDS, (feedItem) => {\n console.log(`Received spam notification: ${feedItem.title}`);\n});\npushSDKSocket.on(EVENTS.CHAT_RECEIVED_MESSAGE, (message) => {\n console.log(`Received chat message: ${message.text}`);\n});\n```\n\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\n\nThat’s it!

These latest additions to our suite of web3-native communication products are set to revolutionize the world of web3 messaging offering secure and speedy wallet-to-wallet communication for all.\n\nPush Chat and Push Group Chat is now available to everyone!💪\n\nThe public launch of Push Chat is a major step forward in realizing our vision of becoming the de-facto communication layer of web3. Our mission has always been to empower the user experience on web3, and we’re excited to see Push Chat and Push Group Chat take us one step closer to achieving this goal.\n\nCome check out Push Chat for yourself!👉 https://app.push.org/#/chat\n\n## How Does Push Chat Work?\nWith Push Chat now available to the public, web3 users can enjoy a seamless, secure, and truly private messaging experience. Using advanced technologies such as IPFS, encryption, and message pinning on Push Nodes, Push Chat ensures a no-message drop experience for the users. Additionally, each message and notification carries a unique [verification proof](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification) that allows the front-end to confirm the authenticity of the sender and message content.\n\nPush Protocol first announced Push Chat at Devcon in October 2022. The alpha was released to select members of the Push community. We’re excited now to make Push Chat available to anyone in the Push ecosystem.\n\nYou can learn more details about Push Nodes, sending and receiving messages on Push Chat, storage, and security of messages [here](https://medium.com/push-protocol/were-still-pushing-a-deeper-look-into-push-chat-90fdea8d9e8e).\n\n## Push Chat: Paving the Way for Decentralized Communication\nAs the web becomes more decentralized, it’s crucial for applications to protect user data and prevent censorship. The Push Protocol team is taking on this fundamental problem in web3 with a two-step strategy that ensures [immutability of content](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification) and elimination of censorship.\n\n## What makes Push Chat an ideal messaging solution for web3 dapps and their users?\nFirst, it is a permissionless protocol, meaning that any address on any platform can use their account to chat with any other account across web3, without the need to sign up with personal information. Second, Push Chat is forward-compatible, allowing it to adapt to any changes made to existing or new platforms. This ensures Push Chat remains a reliable and adaptable solution. Third, the user-friendly interface of Push Chat provides a familiar user experience that users can quickly learn. Finally, our Push Chat SDK allows developers to easily integrate the messaging layer into their application or service, improving their CI/CD processes.\n\nIf you’re looking to provide robust communication for your dapp and users, Push Chat is the solution you need!\n\n## Introducing Push Group Chat — A New Way to Collaborate on Push Chat🤝\nSay hello to the newest addition to Push’s communication solutions: Push Group Chat. Group Chat, inherent in its name, allows web3 users to create group chats, online communities, come together and share experiences natively on web3.\n\nWith the introduction of Group Chat, the potential use cases for Push Chat expand to include applications for DAOs, NFT communities, gaming, and more.\n\n![GroupChat](./image-1.png)\n\nAdditionally, since Push Chat is built on top of Push Nodes, if you choose to, every chat message sent or received can have notifications natively! All web2 communications start with a notification, so why should web3 be any different?\n\n## What are the Group Chat features?\nGroup Chat comes with several functionalities to enhance the chat experience on your dapp including:\n\n- Token gate your group: Choose to allow only addresses that hold an ERC20 or a certain NFT to be part of your group.\n- Public or Private groups: Create transparent groups where the community can read the message content or private groups where only the group members can read the chat messages.\n- Group Meta: Have fun with it! Select a funny group name, add a group description, and select your best group picture.\n- Add/remove admins and members: Add and remove wallet addresses to the group or promote them to become group admins so they can change group information.\n- Share Files: Not only can you chat with your web3 friends, but you can also share hilarious GIFs, awesome images, and even important files.\n\nWhat’s more? Each wallet can create up to 10 groups.\n\nWith Push Group Chat, the possibilities are endless!\n\nHead over to our docs to learn how you can start creating web3 communities with the Group Chat feature 👉https://docs.push.org/developers\n\n## Pushing the Limits of Web3 Communication\nAs we look to the future, the potential for web3-native communication solutions is limitless. We’re constantly striving to improve the user experience on web3 by creating solutions that prioritize privacy, security, and transparency. With the launch of Push Chat and the introduction of Push Group Chat, we’re at the forefront of an exciting new era in web3 communication and we’re glad to take this journey with you all.\n\nCome check out Push Chat for yourself!👉 https://app.push.org/#/chat\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

It includes components for rendering notifications, spam notifications, and forms for subscribing and unsubscribing to spam notification channels.\n\nIn this blog post, we'll take a closer look at the components included in the <b>@pushprotocol/uiweb</b> package and how you can use them in your dApp.\n\n## Components\n### NotificationItem\nThis component displays a single notification item. It takes the following props:\n\n- <b>notificationTitle</b> (string): The title of the notification.\n- <b>notificationBody</b> (string): The body of the notification.\n- <b>app</b> (string): The name of the app that sent the notification.\n- <b>icon</b> (string): The URL of an icon to display next to the notification title.\n- <b>image</b> (string): The URL of an image to display in the notification.\n- <b>url</b> (string): The URL to open when the notification is clicked.\n- <b>theme</b> (string): The theme to use for the notification. Possible values are 'light' and 'dark'.\n- <b>chainName</b> (string): The name of the blockchain the notification was sent on. Possible values are \"ETH_TEST_GOERLI\", \"POLYGON_TEST_MUMBAI”.\n- <b>isSpam</b> (boolean, optional): Set to true if the notification is spam.\n- <b>subscribeFn</b> (function, optional): A function to call when the user clicks the \"Opt-in\" button on a spam notification.\n- <b>isSubscribedFN</b> (function, optional): A function that returns a boolean indicating whether the user is subscribed to the spam notification's channel.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport { NotificationItem } from \"@pushprotocol/uiweb\";\n\nfunction MydApp() {\n  const notifications = [\n    {\n      title: \"Notification 1\",\n      message: \"This is the first notification\",\n      app: \"My App\",\n      icon: \"https://my-app.com/icon.png\",\n      image: \"https://my-app.com/image.png\",\n      url: \"https://my-app.com/notification-1\",\n      blockchain: \"ETH_TEST_GOERLI\"\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Notification 2\",\n      message: \"This is the second notification\",\n      app: \"My App\",\n      icon: \"https://my-app.com/icon.png\",\n      image: \"https://my-app.com/image.png\",\n      url: \"https://my-app.com/notification-2\",\n      blockchain: \"ETH_TEST_GOERLI\"\n    }\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {notifications.map((notification, i) => (\n        <NotificationItem\n          key={i}\n          notificationTitle={notification.title}\n          notificationBody={notification.message}\n          app={notification.app}\n          icon={notification.icon}\n          image={notification.image}\n          url={notification.url}\n          theme={{ background: \"blue\", color: \"white\" }}\n          chainName={notification.blockchain}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\nThe <b>Notification Item</b> component can also be used to render spam notifications. To get the spam data, you can use the <b>PushAPI.user.getFeeds() </b> method with the <b>spam</b> parameter set to <b>true</b>.\n\nThe <b>NotificationItem</b> component is a general-purpose component that can be used to render any type of notification item, including spam notifications. It accepts props such as <b>notificationTitle, notificationBody, cta, app, icon, image,</b> and <b>url</b> to customize the appearance and behavior of the component.\n\nThe <b>Spam</b> component is a specialized variant of the <b>NotificationItem</b> component that is specifically designed for rendering spam notifications. It includes additional props such as <b>isSpam, subscribeFn,</b> and <b>isSubscribedFn</b> that allow the user to interact with the spam notification channel. It also includes an unsubscribe form that is displayed if the user is subscribed to the spam notification channel.\n\nYou can use the <b>PushAPI.user.getFeeds()</b> method with the <b>spam</b> parameter set to <b>true</b> to get the spam data. Here's an example of how you can use it:\n\n\n```js\nconst spams = await PushAPI.user.getFeeds({\n  user: 'eip155:5:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681',\n  spam: true,\n  env: 'staging'\n});\n```\n\nTo render the <b>Notification Item</b> component for each spam notification, you'll need to pass in the additional props <b>isSpam, subscribeFn,</b> and <b>isSubscribedFn</b>\n\n- isSpam: A boolean value indicating whether the notification is a spam notification\n- subscribeFn: A function that opts the user in to the spam notification's channel\n- isSubscribedFn: A function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the user is subscribed to the spam notification's channel\nHere’s an example of how you can render the Notification Item component for each spam notification:\n\n\n```js\n{spams.map((oneNotification, i) => {\n  const { \n    cta,\n    title,\n    message,\n    app,\n    icon,\n    image,\n    url,\n    blockchain,\n    secret,\n    notification\n  } = oneNotification;\n\nreturn (\n    <NotificationItem\n      key={`spam-${i}`}\n      notificationTitle={title}\n      notificationBody={message}\n      cta={cta}\n      app={app}\n      icon={icon}\n      image={image}\n      url={url}\n      theme={theme}\n      chainName={blockchain}\n      isSpam={true}\n      subscribeFn={subscribeFn}\n      isSubscribedFn={isSubscribedFn}\n    />\n  );\n})}\n```\n\nTo implement the <b>subscribeFn</b> and <b>isSubscribedFn</b> functions, you can use the <b>PushAPI.channel.subscribe()</b> and <b>PushAPI.channel.subscribe()</b> methods from @pushprotocol/restapi package, respectively.\n\nFor examples on how you can implement these functions, check out [PUSH-SDK Rest API blog post](https://medium.com/push-protocol/getting-started-with-push-sdk-rest-api-%EF%B8%8F-821e5b8389cc) we recently published.\n\nHere’s an example of how you can implement these functions:\n\n```js\nawait PushAPI.channels.subscribe({\n  signer: _signer,\n  user: 'eip155:5:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681',\n  channel: 'eip155:5:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681',\n\tenv: 'staging'\n});\n\nconst subscriptions = await PushAPI.user.getSubscriptions({\n  user: 'eip155:5:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681',\n  env: 'staging'\n});\n```\n\n## Putting it all together\nHere is an example using <b>subscribeFn</b> that demonstrates the <b>uiweb</b> components used together.\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { NotificationItem, chainNameType } from \"@pushprotocol/uiweb\";\n\nfunction MydApp() {\n  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([]);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchNotifications = async () => {\n      // fetch user notifications using the PushAPI\n      const notifications = await PushAPI.user.getFeeds({\n        user: 'eip155:5:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681', // user address in CAIP\n        env: 'staging'\n      });\n      setNotifications(notifications);\n    };\n    fetchNotifications();\n  }, []);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>MydApp</h1>\n      <h2>Notifications</h2>\n      {notifications.map((notification, i) => {\n        const {\n          title,\n          message,\n          app,\n          icon,\n          image,\n          url,\n          blockchain\n        } = notification;\n        return (\n          <NotificationItem\n            key={i}\n            notificationTitle={title}\n            notificationBody={message}\n            app={app}\n            icon={icon}\n            image={image}\n            url={url}\n            theme={theme}\n            chainName={blockchain as chainNameType}\n          />\n        );\n      })}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n<b>MydApp</b> is a component that renders a list of notifications and spam notifications, as well as a form for subscribing to or unsubscribing from spam notifications. It uses the following components from the <b>@pushprotocol/uiweb</b> package:\n\n- <b>NotificationItem:</b> A React component for rendering a single notification item.\n- <b>Spam:</b> A React component for rendering a single spam notification item, with options for subscribing or unsubscribing to the spam notification channel.\n- <b>Subscribe:</b> A React component for rendering a form for subscribing to a spam notification channel.\n- <b>Unsubscribe:</b> A React component for rendering a form for unsubscribing from a spam notification channel.\n\n<b>MydApp</b> uses the <b>useState</b> and <b>useEffect</b> Hooks to fetch and display the user's notifications and spam notifications using the <b>PushAPI</b>. It also defines event handlers for subscribing to and unsubscribing from spam notifications.\n\n<b>MydApp</b> returns a JSX element that contains the following elements:\n\n- A <b>div</b> element with a <b>h1</b> element for the title of the application and a <b>h2</b> element for the section heading for the notifications.\n- A loop that renders a <b>NotificationItem</b> component for each notification in the <b>notifications</b> array.\n- A <b>h2</b> element for the section heading for the spam notifications.\n- A loop that renders a <b>Spam</b> component for each spam notification in the <b>spamNotifications</b> array.\n- A <b>h2</b> element for the section heading for the subscription form.\n- An <b>Unsubscribe</b> component if the user is subscribed to spam notifications, or a <b>Subscribe</b> component if the user is not subscribed to spam notifications.\n\nThere are of course other React components that you can to compliment the uiweb API. For instance: the <b>Feed </b>component is a container for displaying a list of notifications in a UI. It takes the following props:\n\n- notifications (array of Notification objects): An array of notifications to be displayed in the feed. Each Notification object should have the following shape:\n- <b>cta</b> (string): The call-to-action text for the notification.\n- <b>title</b> (string): The title of the notification.\n- <b>message</b> (string): The body of the notification.\n- <b>app</b> (string): The name of the app that sent the notification.\n- <b>icon</b> (string): The URL of an icon to be displayed with the notification.\n- <b>image</b> (string): The URL of an image to be displayed with the notification.\n- <b>url</b> (string): The URL to be opened when the notification is clicked.\n- <b>blockchain</b> (string): The name of the blockchain on which the notification was sent.\n- <b>theme</b>(Theme object): An object defining the colors and styles to be used in the feed. The Theme object should have the following shape:\n- <b>background</b> (string): The background color of the feed.\n- <b>color</b> (string): The text color of the feed.\n- <b>chainName</b> (string): The name of the blockchain to be displayed in the feed.\n\nExample:\n```js\nimport NotificationItem from \"@pushprotocol/uiweb/NotificationItem\";\nimport Feed from \"./Feed\"; // User-implemented component\n\nconst notifications = [\n  {\n    cta: \"Learn More\",\n    title: \"Notification 1\",\n    message: \"This is the first notification\",\n    app: \"My App\",\n    icon: \"<https://my-app.com/icon.png>\",\n    image: \"<https://my-app.com/image.png>\",\n    url: \"<https://my-app.com/notification-1>\",\n    blockchain: \"Ethereum\"\n  },\n  {\n    cta: \"Get Started\",\n    title: \"Notification 2\",\n    message: \"This is the second notification\",\n    app: \"My App\",\n    icon: \"<https://my-app.com/icon.png>\",\n    image: \"<https://my-app.com/image.png>\",\n    url: \"<https://my-app.com/notification-2>\",\n    blockchain: \"Ethereum\"\n  }\n];\nfunction MydApp() {\n  return (\n    <Feed\n      notifications={notifications}\n      theme={{ background: \"blue\", color: \"white\" }}\n      chainName=\"Ethereum\"\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThat’s it! You now know how to use the components of the <b>@pushprotocol/uiweb</b> API to add push notification functionality to your application.\n\nWe’ll cover the other parts of the SDK in the coming posts. More reference material is available in the [Push Protocol SDK documentation](https://docs.push.org/developers/developer-tooling/push-sdk).\n\nIn addition, try out the [Push SDK sandbox](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-sdk-sandbox).\n\nKeep PUSHING! #PoweredbyPush\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

These Decentralized Nodes Connect Web3 and Web2, Allowing Your Platform to Receive Notifications from Validating and Indexing Storage Nodes, Tied Directly to Your Wallet Address and Multi-Chain Identity</ImageText>\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n<!--customheaderpoint-->\n# The Swiftest Route to Web3 Notifications, Chats, and More Across Mobile, Desktop, and Extensions.\n\n## What are the Delivery Nodes?\nPush Delivery Nodes serve as a decentralized solution for connecting web3 and web2. They allow any centralized or decentralized platform to receive communications from Push Storage Nodes, which validate and index all communications and link them to a user’s wallet address and multi-chain identity.\n\nDevelopers can run these nodes on their backend to connect their web2 infrastructure to web3 communication, allowing for extended communication beyond web3 wallet addresses to web2 platform users. Push Delivery Nodes enable mapping any web2 device token or platform username to a specific web3 wallet address, which can then send alerts to web2 or web2.5 platforms.\n\nExamples of platforms that can be reached include crypto wallet apps, mobile apps, browser extensions, Telegram and Discord bots, email alerts, and more.\n\nFor a pure web3 experience, listening to Push Storage Nodes or utilizing their RPC endpoints/SDK is the best option. However, if you’re a developer looking to extend these communication experiences to centralized platforms, you need to use Push Delivery Nodes.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.png)\n\n\n## 7 Steps for Getting Started With the Delivery Node Module🌱\n### Prerequisites\n- MYSQL (Version >= 5.7)\n- Redis (Version >= 6.0)\n- Docker (For local setup)\n- Google FCM Account Setup\n### Step 1: Clone Push delivery node repo\nGit clone can be found here: https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-delivery-node.git\n\n### Step 2: Environment configuration\nRefer env sample file. The MYSQL DB credentials and Redis URL needs to be updated. The remaining conf need not be edited as of now.\n\nIf you use docker-compose for the local setup MYSQL DB and Redis config can be left as it is.\n\n```js\n# REDIS\nREDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379\n# DELIVERY NODE MYSQL DATABASE\nDELIVERY_NODE_DB_HOST=localhost\nDELIVERY_NODE_DB_NAME=dbname\nDELIVERY_NODE_DB_USER=user\nDELIVERY_NODE_DB_PASS=pass\nDELIVERY_NODE_DB_PORT=3306\n```\n### Step 3. a: Infra setup: (local)\nThe docker-compose will bring up the MYSQL, Redis, and PHPMyAdmin containers for the Delivery Node.\n\n\n```js\ndocker compose up\n```\n\n### Step 3. b: (Alternate) infra setup: (Production)\n- Host MYSQL and Redis Separately\n- Add MYSQL and Redis credentials in the .env file\n### Step 4: FCM project setup\n- Refer https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n- Create the firebase-adminsdk.json file in the root folder and add the FCM JSON to this file\n### Step 5: Build the delivery node project\nYou should then be able to build the project using:\n\n```js\ncd push-delivery-node\nnpm install\n```\n### Step 6: Start the delivery node project\nYou should be able to start the server using:\n\n```js\ncd push-delivery-node\nnpm start\n```\n\n### Step 7: Device registration\n- An endpoint is hosted as part of the delivery node project, which can be used for device registration.\n- Below is the API to create a mapping between the wallet address and the device token for which the messages need to be delivered.\n- <delivery_node_url> is the base URL of the Delivery node you have hosted.\n\nBelow is the curl request of this endpoint\n\n```js\ncurl - location - request POST 'https://<delivery_node_url>/apis/v1/pushtokens/register' \\\n - header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n - data-raw '{\n\"wallet\": \"eip155:0x35B84d6848D16415177c64D64504663b998A6ab4\",\n\"device_token\": \"device_token\",\n\"platform\": \"android\"\n}'\n```\n\n## Useful Links\n- <i>Delivery Node Repo Link:</i> <a href='https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-delivery-node'>https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-delivery-node</a>\n- <i>Demo Mobile App Repo Link:</i> <a href='https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/demo-push-mobile-app'>https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/demo-push-mobile-app</a>\n- <i>Delivery Node Setup Video Tutorial:</i>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OlRHL3qd4oY\" title=\"Get started with Push Delivery Nodes | #web3 communication\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<i>PUSH Documentation:</i>  <a href='https://docs.push.org/developers/developer-guides/receiving-notifications/receiving-via-delivery-node'>https://docs.push.org/developers/developer-guides/receiving-notifications/receiving-via-delivery-node</a>\n\n## Push Support\nIf at any point you find yourself needing assistance and help with getting set up, Push has a team of helpful developers ready when you need it.\n\nCome join us in Discord where you can get assistance and meet other devs who are building with Push👉 https://discord.com/invite/pushprotocol\n\n## Push SNS Module for Delivery Node\nWe have also launched the Push SNS Module for the delivery nodes, which instantly allows any developer to receive notifications, chats, or any other form of web3 communication directly to the platform they are building with the help of webhooks.\n\nYou can find more details here.\n\n### What’s next for Push Delivery Nodes?\n- Dockerization\n- Analytics\n- Monitoring APIs\n- Support Push Chat\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

With our new launch, the door is wide open for the Push ecosystem to grow dramatically and bring on new exciting use cases for our communication solutions.\n\nWith this announcement, we’re excited to introduce our BNB launch Collaborators who are collaborating with Push on various use cases to bring web3 native notification and messaging to users across the BNB ecosystem.\n\n### Push and BNB: Decentralized communication to power web3 UX\nUsing Push, BNB dapp developers can begin adding notification services to their dapps, building custom communication channels, and enabling wallet-to-wallet communication for users (check out [this guide](https://docs.push.org/developers/developer-guides/create-your-notif-channel/enabling-channel-on-other-chains/bnb-chain-binance-channel-setup) for getting started). For end-users, this means enhanced capacity to stay updated on critical information relevant to their favorite dapps.\n\nThe BNB notification ecosystem will be available through the primary Push Protocol app: [app.push.org](http://app.push.org/). For users, you can follow this [user guide](https://docs.push.org/users/basics/how-to-start-using-push-notifications) to begin opting-in to channels.\n\nThis integration is a major step forward in Push’s mission to provide seamless and decentralized web3 communication and we are thrilled to have eight new frens from BNB joining our mission.\n\nLet’s explore some interesting use cases these frens are deploying with Push.\n\n### Staying updated about critical events with Push notifications\nFor a powerful DEX aggregator like 1inch [Network](https://1inch.io/), rapid changes in token prices among various DEXes create the need for quick notifications. Thanks to Push, 1inch is now updating users on exchange rates, limit order executions, and expiry statuses eliminating the need for continuous monitoring of token exchange rates. Additionally, 1inch DAO can now send new governance proposal notifications directly to members’ wallet addresses using Push. 1inchers can [opt-in](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x1a9dDEf485674fC60a269cf97FAbc6b8728A3497) to the channel now, and start receiving notifications.\n\nCEX and DEX liquidity aggregator, [Orion Protocol](https://www.orionprotocol.io/), is the single point of access to the crypto market, combining the top crypto exchanges into [one order book](https://trade.orionprotocol.io/). Through Push’s seamless wallet-to-wallet technology, the Orion team can now keep users informed of their [developments](https://blog.orionprotocol.io/terminalupdates) via Push notifications.\n\nWith an ever-growing DeFi ecosystem and an increasing amount of on-chain activity, constant innovation is required to accommodate the growing needs of DeFi users. For one, users need to be updated about their positions and market conditions. Having to stay on top of market conditions and portfolio statutes 24/7 is exhausting. This is where notifications and real-time alerts prove useful.\n\nDeFi apps that require active management of positions can often lead to forgotten collateral and live loan positions. By sending real-time insights and liquidation alerts to users, liquidation can be avoided. For other critical events like price swings and changes in vault strategies, users can be notified to prompt timely action on their portfolios.\n\n### Improving access to DeFi tools\nUse cases are being established with [Apeswap](https://apeswap.finance/) to enhance access to DeFi tools like staking and farming. By alerting users when a new pool launches or new bonds are issued, users are given all the information they need to participate in the latest pool on time. Users can [opt-in](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x0e255B1900b8cE23f8E818C7Ee08cfd5b41df748) to the channel now, and start receiving notifications.\n\n[ZeroSwap](https://zeroswap.io/) is another protocol taking advantage of Push notifications to assist users with their trading strategies by updating them with the latest price information.\n\n### Enhanced governance and community participation\nAlmost every protocol that’s integrated Push is utilizing notifications to also enhance governance on their platform. For DAOs and decentralized exchanges like Sushi, community participation is key to the growth of their network.\n\nTo enable this trust and distributed decision-making, users need to stay on top of what’s happening. For [Sushi](https://www.sushi.com/), Push notifications are being used to update users about upcoming governance proposals within the forum as well as a medium for connecting with the community. Sushi channel is now live on Push, [opt-in here](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x458E4E1877F2F0D6752bD6f6DFd2e9048C2A56b3).\n\nDeFi apps like [Thena](https://thena.fi/) are implementing Push notifications to notify users to timely vote on their staking rewards program. Users can opt-in to [Thena channel](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xC59c69342eb0bF2635dac683e44cEB2A18a5C38d) now.\n\nGovernance is better with Push!\n\n### Increasing player retention and enhancing the Metaverse experience\nMetaverse and NFT gaming have been all the rage recently. But while the Metaverse space garners a lot of attention, lacking native web3 communication remains a major challenge. NFT-gaming platform, [Wombat](https://www.wombat.app/), is solving this problem by integrating Push into their platform. For an ecosystem that relies heavily on player-to-player interactions, native communication tools can go a long way in enhancing the overall UX of Wombat.\n\n[SecondLive](https://secondlive.world/), a create-to-earn open Metaverse, is also committed to providing the best user experience and is working with Push to enable native web3 communication within their Metaverse. By enabling Push notifications and Chat, SecondLive is able to create a decentralized and transparent communication channel between its platform and users.\n\n### Pushing for success together with Frens\nWhile a lot of interesting use cases have already been established with our new frens, this is only the start of an exciting journey on BNB Chain. There are a ton of applications for communication tools yet to be explored and we cannot wait to get started.\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol).\n\nStay updated on BNB Chain: [Website](https://www.bnbchain.org/en), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN), [Telegram](https://t.me/bnbchain), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BNBChainOfficial), [Discord](https://discord.gg/bnbchain), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bnbchaininnovation/), [Build N’ Build Forum](https://www.buildnbuild.dev/), [Dev Community](https://bnbdev.community/)"

This means the largest web3 communication platform is now available to BNB’s ecosystem of thousands of dapps and hundreds of thousands of daily users.\n\nBack in September 2022, Push launched on Polygon’s mainnet, signaling our first step into becoming <i>the</i> multi-chain communication protocol for all of web3. Staying true to our commitment of an interoperable future, the next chain to support Push Protocol is BNB Chain.\n\nThe launch of Push Protocol on BNB Chain will enable <i>Push Notifications</i> and <i>Push Chat</i>. Read on to learn more.\n\n###  Push Notifications on BNB Chain\nTo date, Push Protocol has powered over 25 million notifications to +70,000 subscribers across the Ethereum and Polygon networks. The BNB Chain launch will allow existing BNB dapps and developers to launch and create their own channels and offer customized notifications in response to on- and off-chain events.\n\nAny application or individual can launch a notification channel starting today. At launch, 1inch, Sushi, Thena, and Apeswap channels will be live for mainnet notifications.\n\nBNB Chain will be implementing Push Smart Contracts v1.5, the newest upgrade to the Push Protocol. Push v1.5 upgrades provide imperative features including <i>channel creation with PUSH token, enabling notifications using Subgraph, inclusion of EIP-1271, etc.</i> Additionally, it also enables extra customization, including time-bound channels and editable channel details. The Protocol Fee Pool in v1.5 will deduct 10 PUSH from the original staked amount (minimum 50 PUSH to create a channel) for any critical transaction (like creation, reactivation, or detail modification). As part of the upcoming v2 release, the Protocol Fee Pool will have more functionality — including allowing protocol users to claim rewards and distributing funds to wallets that integrate Push Protocol. [Learn more about Push v1.5!](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-push-protocol-v1-5-80eb39b55424)\n\nAll of these features will be enabled for BNB Chain notifications starting today. The BNB notification ecosystem will be available through the primary Push Protocol app: [app.push.org](http://app.push.org/). In order to create and enable your channel for the BNB Chain, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.push.org/developers/developer-guides/create-your-notif-channel/enabling-channel-on-other-chains/binance-smart-chain-channel-setup) to ensure the complete setup is done adequately.\n\n### Push Chat on BNB Chain\nIn October, Push Protocol announced our alpha for Push Chat — p2p web3 native chat between on-chain addresses. Push Chat is enabled for Ethereum and Polygon addresses, and with the BNB Chain launch, whitelisted addresses can now chat through BNB Chain as well. We’ll have more information about the continued rollout of Push Chat, so stay tuned on the [Push Protocol Twitter.](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol)\n\n### Existing Push Ethereum & Polygon Users\nTo existing Push Protocol users on Ethereum and Polygon — say hello to the BNB Chain communities! And get ready for more mainnet announcements down the road. With today’s BNB announcement, no action is needed by Ethereum and Polygon users. All notifications and channels will remain functional, as will PUSH staking and rewards.\n\n### Conclusion\nBack in September with the Push Protocol rebrand, we made a promise to build out the multi-chain communication protocol for all of web3. With the Polygon and Push Chat launches, we started our journey. With today’s BNB Chain launch, we’re continuing that promise to the Push community and to web3 at large.\n\nLet’s #PUSH for web3 communication!\n\n#PoweredbyPush\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nThis week, we are glad to feature our fren and the leading crypto index platform — Phuture Finance.\n\nPhuture Finance is an investment platform that combines passive exposure to crypto assets with transparency and lasting value. As such, the index platform is working towards making DeFi more accessible by bringing yield-generating index funds to risk-averse crypto investors.\n\nIf you’re an investor who wants to bank upon the crypto revolution without dealing with complexity or extensive tracking, Phuture Finance is your solution.\n\nAs a crypto investment platform, Phuture places a strong emphasis on creating a trustworthy environment for its investors. Communication plays a significant role in this regard and Push is glad to be the solutions provider! By collaborating with Push, Phuture delivers investment updates directly to its users, thereby enabling a culture of transparency on the platform.\n\nFor this episode of “Frens of Push”, we sat down with Oliver Mehr, co-founder of \nPhuture Finance to talk about Phuture’s mission of enabling transparency in the DeFi realm and how Push is helping further this mission.\n\n### Hi Oliver, how did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What’s your story?\nI became involved in crypto in late 2016 when the family office that I was working for at the time started to invest in crypto. It started off with just Bitcoin and Ethereum but grew from there, participating in the ICO boom and ultimately culminating in the creation of a venture fund, SVK Crypto, to invest in early-stage blockchain-based businesses. After fully deploying the capital for that fund and realizing the potential that decentralized finance had to offer, we began building Phuture.\n\n### Tell us about Phuture — what’s it about, and what problem does Phuture solve?\nPhuture is a decentralized protocol that gives users passive exposure to crypto assets. Phuture creates on-chain index funds and structured products so anyone can get exposure to crypto without the complexity of managing each asset individually. Phuture’s products are built with best-in-class methodologies and audited to the highest standards.\n\nHere’s how it looks:\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.png)\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-2.png)\n\n### What’s your 2023 plan for Phuture?\nIn 2023, we plan to take on-chain index funds and structured products to the next level with the launch of Phuture V2 a next-generation non-custodial asset management protocol. We will be releasing more details about Phuture V2 as we get closer to the launch so make sure to stay updated through our socials.\n\n### How is Phuture using Push’s web3 communication layer?\nPhuture is leveraging the Push protocol to create a communication channel with our users that relies solely on their wallet address and no other personal information. Through our channel, we send our users weekly updates on the performance of their portfolio as well as notify them when we rebalance our index products.\n\n<blockquote><i>Engaging with your users in web3 has been an ongoing problem and we believe that through Push we can provide our users with both general updates on our products as well as notifications tailored to their Phuture portfolio. Ultimately, we believe the integration of web3 notifications into Phuture will drastically improve the user experience over time.</i></blockquote>\n\n### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\nPush provides ample flexibility for us to utilize our subgraph data within our notifications to deliver accurate, account-tailored information the moment an on-chain event occurs, the timestamp is met or the transaction is triggered.\n\n### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\nWe are most excited about seeing Push get integrated directly into consumer wallets so that notifications can be sent straight to a person’s wallet. We believe this will massively increase the adoption rate and engagement of Web3 communications through a seamless user experience.\n\nThank you once again for your time Oliver!\n\n### About Phuture\nPhuture (PHTR) is a decentralized crypto index platform that simplifies investments through automated, themed index funds on Ethereum.

Whether it’s employee payroll, web3 subscriptions, or real-time investing, the need for ongoing money transfers has become more important than ever. Superfluid solves this exact problem by enabling continuous money streaming, thereby helping users, developers, and projects simplify recurring value transfer in web3.\n\nWith a single on-chain transaction, Superfluid allows users to send ongoing money streams that transfer value second by second in a constant flow. In effect, crypto-native organizations can now ensure a smooth and efficient flow of money to multiple employees or contributors on a recurring basis or receive on-chain subscription revenue.\n\n## Push X Superfluid\nAs a money-streaming platform, Superfluid empowers individuals and organizations to handle payments and subscriptions in a trustless, decentralized manner. The creation of such an ecosystem calls for a transparent communication model between Superfluid and its users. This is precisely where Push comes in!\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\n'We’re incredibly excited to integrate with Push. Although our ecosystem has seen tremendous growth to date, it’s difficult to build engaging web3 apps without having a direct communication channel with users. This is especially challenging when users are primarily identified by their wallet addresses.\n\nWith Push, we can now provide users with time-sensitive notifications in a secure, decentralized, and personalized way.' — Francesco Renzi, CEO and Co-Founder of Superfluid\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\nWith this collaboration, Superfluid users can opt-in to notifications through the Push apps for when:\n\n- Super Token balances are low for outgoing streams\n- A Super Token balance hit zero and outgoing streams were liquidated\nAs a result of this integration, Superfluid will have a verified channel on Push that users or developers can try out to subscribe to alerts and updates about their streams directly on their devices.\n\nIn the near future, Push will feature as part of Superfluid Dashboard notifications, and we hope that many others in the Superfluid ecosystem make use of these capabilities too.\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\n'We’re thrilled to announce our partnership with Superfluid, a pioneer in web3 money streaming. By combining Push’s web3-native communication tools with Superfluid’s innovative payment primitive, we’re enabling a truly seamless and connected web3 experience for Superfluid users.\n\nHowever, this is just the first stage of our integration with Superfluid and we can’t wait to provide more enhancements in the near future!' — Harsh Rajat, CEO of Push Protocol\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\nPush is excited to be encouraging financial flexibility with Superfluid, and looks forward to individuals and businesses having greater awareness around their streams!\n\nBeyond that, we are looking forward to delivering more decentralized notifications to Superfluid users in the coming months enabling deeper notification integration for future versions of Superfluid.\n\nThe user experience enhancements for Superfluid users is only just beginning!\n\n<b>#PoweredbyPush</b>\n\nIf you need help subscribing to the Superfluid channel, you can check out [this helpful walkthrough document here](https://help.superfluid.finance/en/articles/6974092-superfluid-push-channel).\n\n\n## About Superfluid\n[Superfluid](http://superfluid.finance/) is the leading asset streaming protocol that enables web3 native subscriptions, salaries, and rewards for DAOs and crypto-native businesses. Superfluid streams transfer value in a constant flow over time between wallets in a non-custodial and permissionless manner. Superfluid Protocol can be used to describe cash flows and execute them automatically on-chain, over time, and in a non-interactive way.\n\nMoney streams are programmable, composable, and modular, allowing developers to build custom applications on top of the protocol. No capital is locked up, and all inflows and outflows are netted in real-time at every block without consuming any gas. Ongoing streams can be forwarded as they are received to both wallets and applications, eliminating delays and drastically increasing capital efficiency.\n\n[Website](https://www.superfluid.finance/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/superfluid_HQ), [Github](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JrnpZWymeU), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/superfluid/)\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

That’s Wherever for you. The platform enables web3 dapps to communicate with wallets directly, no matter where they are. Communication wherever, literally!\n\nBy way of this collaboration, Push provides Wherever the infrastructure to facilitate wallet communication with an emphasis on personalization, automation, and user experience. Wherever relies on Push’s communication layer to deliver in-app notifications while ensuring a decentralized relay and storage.\n\nIn this episode of “Frens of Push”, Amos joins us to talk about how the pilot collaboration between Push and Wherever has the potential to disrupt web3 communication.\n\n## Hi Amos, how did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What’s your story?\n<b>Amos:</b> Before I started working on Wherever, I founded an airline communication startup, helping the biggest airlines in the world communicate with their passengers during flight disruptions. Working with web2 communication infrastructure at a large scale really showed me how fragmented and antiquated it is. Dominated by either siloed walled gardens or out-of-date messaging protocols, the digital communication space was broken. In search of other alternatives, I came across the potential of web3 to disrupt this huge space and decided that I have to join this revolution. And so together with my two amazing friends and co-founders, Niv Oppenhaim and Ido Goldberg, we started Wherever on a mission to help create an internet where users can communicate with anyone from wherever.\n\n### Tell us about Wherever — what’s it about, and what problem does Wherever solve?\n<b>Amos:</b> Wherever is a wallet-first communication platform. We help web3 projects communicate directly with wallets, wherever they are. Today, dapps and communities struggle to rise above the noise on Twitter and Discord, lacking a more personalized channel with their users. On top of the clutter, the web3 identity gap forces projects to “spray and pray” in these web2 platforms, engaging users without understanding their on-chain activity and ownership.\n\nWherever provides product and community managers with the tools to grow a direct web3 communication channel with their users, and leverage web3 messaging protocols to send messages directly to their wallets. Our platform is comprised of three main components — Subscriber Growth tools, Broadcasting Studio, and Web3 Inbox.\n\nGrowth tools are basically APIs, widgets, and Discord bots that help collect web3 subscribers and enable them to connect web2 channels, such as email and Telegram, without compromising their privacy. In the Studio, marketers can broadcast personalized campaigns directly to their users’ wallets based on their digital ownership, and PMs can use our no-code builder to create automated notifications based on the users on-chain activity. Lastly, we enable dapps and Wallet Apps to embed a web3 inbox and empower their users to tap into decentralized and secure messaging.\n\n### What’s your 2023 plan for Wherever?\n<b>Amos:</b> First, we believe that 2023 will be the year of wallet-to-wallet communication! Every project in the space will add web3 native messaging channels to build trust with their users, drive engagement, and foster stronger relationships.\n\nWe’ll be focusing this year on helping dapps onboard their users to this next-gen digital communication, and leverage the messaging protocols to send the right message, at the right time, to the right wallet. Furthermore, we will be introducing cool new ways to create wallet-first loyalty & ambassador programs, user research surveys, customer support, airdrops, and more!\n\n### How is Wherever using Push’s web3 communication layer?\n<b>Amos:</b> Wherever leverages Push’s communication layer to send messages directly to users’ wallets. Push enables us to focus on personalization, automation, and UX while they provide the infrastructure to manage the relay and storage of the messages. Together, we are able to offer any web3 project a communication experience that is on par with web2 but completely decentralized and interoperable. This unlocks a completely new and radically different experience — your inbox, wherever you go!\n\n### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\n<b>Amos:</b> Interactive Messages! Besides interoperability and this notion of “your inbox, wherever”, interactive messaging could be web3’s killer feature. As Gabby Goldberg coined it, “talking to the protocol”, means that the recipient of the message is the protocol itself. Interactive Messages would enable users to do almost everything through the chat interface — send money to a friend, submit an NFT offer, or vote on a new DAO proposal. This will take web3 from “being on par with web2”, to “kicking web2 in the a**”!\n\n### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\n<b>Amos:</b> The experience so far has been great! We look forward to collaborating and helping more web3 projects leverage the Push protocol to engage their users in more delightful ways. Shoutout to Madeline and Richa for being such great partners to us!\n\n___\n\nThanks Amos for the awesome conversation.

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nThe [PUSH-SDK](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-sdk), is a growing JavaScript-based SDK that allows developers to add push notification functionality to their dapps. Using the SDK, developers can:\n\n- Build PUSH features into their dapps\n- Get access to Push Nodes APIs\n- Render Push Notifications UI\n\nIt is written in Typescript and supports React, React Native, Plain JS, and Node JS-based platforms. (We are adding support for more!) It is also built on top of standard Web3 packages like <b>ethers, @web3-react</b>.\n\nIf you’re looking for our full documentation on [Push-SDK REST API, you can find that here](https://docs.push.org/developers/developer-tooling/push-sdk).\n\nBut for now, let’s walk you through the main features of the Push-SDK REST API and how to use them in your code.\n\n## Fetching user notifications\nYou can use the <b>getFeeds</b> method to fetch a user's notifications. This method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\n\n- <b>user</b> (mandatory, string): The user’s address in CAIP format.\n- <b>page</b> (optional, number): The page index of the results. Default is 1.\n- <b>limit</b> (optional, number): The number of items per page. Default is 10.\n- <b>spam</b> (optional, boolean): Whether to fetch spam notifications. Default is false.\n- <b>env</b> (optional, string): The API environment to use. Possible values are ‘prod’ and ‘staging’. Default is ‘prod’.\n- <b>raw</b> (optional, boolean): Whether to return the raw, unformatted API response. Default is <b>false</b>.\n\nHere’s an example of how you might use the <b>getFeeds</b> method in your code:\n\n```js\nconst notifications = await PushAPI.user.getFeeds({\n  user: 'eip155:5:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681',\n  env: 'staging'\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a user address using the CAIP format. CAIP, or Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal, is a way to describe standards for blockchain projects that are not specific to a single chain. It was developed by the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process and is used to identify and encode information about Ethereum addresses, contract addresses, and other crypto-assets.\n\nIt is important to note that CAIP is not a standardized way of identifying and encoding information about crypto-assets; it is under development by the Ethereum community and is not yet widely adopted in the ecosystem.\n\nCAIP addresses are composed of three parts:\n\n- <b>The namespace:</b> This is a string designed to uniquely identify a blockchain ecosystem or set of ecosystems as a namespace.\n- <b>The network ID:</b> This is an integer that identifies the Ethereum network the asset belongs to. For example, 1 is the main network, 3 is the Ropsten test network, and 5 is the Goerli test network.\n- <b>The address:</b> This is the actual address of the asset, encoded as a hexadecimal string.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\neip155:5:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\n```\n\nIn this example, the namespace is eip155 which identifies EVM chains, the network ID is 5 (Goerli test network) and the address is <b>0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681</b>.\n\nCAIP is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for the inclusion of additional information as needed. It is used by the Push Protocol and other Ethereum-based projects as a standardized way of identifying and encoding information about crypto-assets, and distinguishing information from different chains.\n\nContinuing with <b>getFeeds</b>, to fetch spam notifications, set the <b>spam</b> parameter to <b>true</b>:\n\n```js\nconst spams = await PushAPI.user.getFeeds({\n  user: 'eip155:5:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681',\n  spam: true,\n  env: 'staging'\n});\n```\n\nThe <b>getFeeds</b> method returns a list of notifications for the specified user.\n\n## Fetching user subscriptions\nYou can use the <b>getSubscriptions</b> method to fetch a user's subscriptions.

If you want to be featured, reach out to us and you could be our next Fren in the series.\n</i>\n\nThis week, we’re delighted to have on a leading decentralized stablecoin protocol and our fren, QiDao, to talk about their journey with Push.\n\nA bit about [QiDao](https://www.mai.finance/). How do you keep your crypto assets while still being able to spend their value? QiDao stablecoin protocol allows you to lock your tokens out of circulation and be used as collateral to borrow stablecoins. As a borrowing and lending protocol, QiDao is self-sustained, community-run, and completely decentralized.\n\nFor a borrowing protocol, updating its users about their debt positions is immensely important to keep their positions from liquidating. This is where Push steps in. By sending Push notifications directly to users, QiDao is able to update users about the health of their debt positions, thereby preventing potential losses.\n\nIn this episode of ‘Frens of Push’, we sat down with [Benjamin](https://twitter.com/Benjamin918_) from QiDao to talk about the problem QiDao is trying to solve, their vision, and their journey with Push.\n\n\n### Hi Benjamin, how did you first get involved in building in the blockchain space? What’s your story?\n<b>Benjamin:</b> I’ve been in crypto for a few years now. Started launching some infrastructure projects in early blockchains. When the DeFi movement really started, that became more of my focus.\n\n### Tell us about QiDao — what’s it about, and what problem does QiDAO solve?\n<b>Benjamin:</b> QiDao is a stablecoin protocol that allows you to mint MAI against the value of your tokens. What makes MAI special is that you can mint it natively against your favorite collaterals on your favorite chains. As a result, you don’t have to trust bridges to access stablecoins. You can create them on your chain.\n\nAdditionally, MAI loans are 0% interest, so your debt amount does not change. QiDao only charges a 0.5% repayment fee, which stays constant in value no matter when you repay.\n\n### What’s your 2023 plan for QiDao?\n<b>Benjamin:</b> We have a ton planned for 2023. Here are the 3 I’m most excited about.\n\nA stability pool to liquidate debt positions at QiDao will soon be rolled out. This will offer MAI holders a new yield opportunity that won’t rely on inflationary tokenomics. It will also have a component for arbitrageurs to buy collateral assets with MAI at a fixed MAI price of $1.\n\nLiquidation-protected vaults. Our team is working on vaults that will protect users from being liquidated. What’s interesting about this product is that it will be fully onchain, unlike alternative liquidation protection products.\n\nWe’re one of a handful of protocols alpha-testing Chainlink’s brand new CCIP — a cross-chain messaging system. QiDao will likely use this for cross-chain governance and improved bridging.\n\n### How is QiDao using Push’s web3 communication layer?\n<b>Benjamin:</b> When users take loans in crypto, they have to be very careful to maintain the collateralization of their debt position. Otherwise, those debt positions can be liquidated.\n\nAt QiDao, we use Push so that users can stay up to date with the health of their debt positions. This can help prevent unnecessary user losses. In general, users trust Push given their OG status in crypto and their amazing track record.\n\n### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\n<b>Benjamin:</b> It’s amazing! We had people tell us for months that they wanted this integration so it’s great to have this utility. What’s best is that it’s simple to use. And that’s what has brought so many of our users to the platform.\n\n### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\n<b>Benjamin:</b> What Push is really good for is keeping people’s attention. Because normally you exit a dapp and that’s it- no more engagement. Take a look at sites like Twitter, which are always trying to get you back. Push can be a powerful tool for user engagement.\n\nThank you, Benjamin, for taking the time to speak with us. We look forward to accelerating your growth and helping bring value to your users.\n\n## About QiDao\nQiDao is Polygon’s first native stablecoin protocol (and is now supported by multiple chains) that functions on an over-collateralized debt position model. The protocol allows its users to borrow $MAI or miMatic stablecoin against their decentralized token collaterals.\n\nFind out more about QiDao: [Website](https://app.mai.finance/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/QiDaoProtocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mQq55j65xJ), [Docs](https://docs.mai.finance/introduction-1)\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nDecentralized communication is a hot topic in the web3 space as more and more developers are looking to build dapps that can function independently of any single central authority.\n\nThough, a key component of building a successful dapp is providing a communication layer that is both decentralized and universal.\n\nA decentralized communication layer does not rely on any central server or authority. Instead, it depends on a distributed network of nodes to handle and route data between users. This ensures communication is resistant to censorship, tampering, and other forms of interference, as well as be able to function even if some nodes go offline.\n\nIn this way, a universal communication layer is accessible to all users regardless of their device or platform. This is essential in the web3 space, as users will often have a variety of different devices and platforms that they need to interact with to access and use a dApp.\n\n## What does it take to build a web3 communication layer?\nIn general, to build a decentralized and universal communication layer, several vital components are required, including:\n\n- <b>Robust Network Architecture:</b> The network architecture of a decentralized communication layer must be designed to ensure that data can be reliably and efficiently routed between nodes, even in the event of node failures or network congestion.\n- <b>Data storage:</b> Decentralized communication systems typically rely on distributed data storage to ensure that data is stored redundantly across multiple nodes, making it less vulnerable to data loss or corruption.\n- <b>Consensus:</b> A consensus mechanism ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the system’s state. This is particularly important in decentralized systems, as there is no central authority to ensure that all nodes are in sync. Network maintainers must verify and finalize message data for a communication layer to function.\n- <b>Security:</b> Securing a decentralized communication system is a significant concern, as there are a variety of potential attack vectors that could be used to compromise the security of the system. A communication layer must consider encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure the safety of the users’ data.\n- <b>Interoperability:</b> A universal communication layer must interact seamlessly with various devices and platforms, so a communication protocol needs to ensure that the system can handle different data formats and protocols.\n- <b>Composable:</b> A communication layer must be able to adapt to a variety of conditions and improve as required. This includes the incorporation of new technologies and web-based systems.\n\nWith these components, a web3 communication layer can offer censorship-resistant, privacy-preserving, and spam-protected communication while being chain-agnostic, gasless, and scalable\n\n## Are we still Pushing? We’re always Pushing.\nBuilding a decentralized communication layer is a process, not a product, meaning it’s not something that can be fully achieved but rather something that requires consistent development.\n\nThe team at [Push Protocol](https://push.org/) is continuously working on improving its architecture by crafting and refining the key components for building a communication layer. With a strong focus on security and performance, Push is working to bring the best decentralized communication tools possible to the web3 space.\n\nAs a result, the Push Protocol community continues to rapidly evolve and is getting closer to reaching its goal of enabling millions of users and devices to communicate simultaneously across web3. Push brings novel communication capabilities to the decentralized world with real-time messaging, efficient message dissemination, and interoperability, allowing it to become the communication standard for dApps.\n\nStay tuned! In upcoming posts, we’ll delve into the technical details with each component, from peer-to-peer networking to message verification.\n\nPssssssst 🤫\n\nThanks for making it this far.\n\nIf you’re interested in exploring how Push Notifications or Push Chat can boost user engagement and benefit your project, check out:\n\n- [Our Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) — we’ve got devs ready to give your project whatever support and consultation you need.\n- [Push developer docs](https://docs.push.org/developers/) to get started on building right away!\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

If you want to be featured, reach out to us and you could be our next Fren in the series.\n</i>\n\nSince its conception, the goal of [Developer DAO](https://www.developerdao.com/) has been to onboard, educate, and support web3 developers with all the tools they need to successfully build the next generation of web3 projects. With over 5,000+ members from around the world, it’s safe to say the Developer DAO mission to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders has been widely accepted.\n\nFor a DAO that relies on the participation of its members to operate effectively, communication remains an integral component. By [integrating Push Notifications](https://medium.com/push-protocol/developer-dao-x-push-enhancing-ux-through-web3-communication-tools-7538b5656d43), the D_D community can now enhance its communication capacities and hence UX, by enabling members to better stay updated on the latest governance proposals, forum topics, and other important updates.\n\nIn this episode of “Frens of Push”, we are in conversation with [Krinza](https://twitter.com/kayprasla) from Developer DAO to talk about how Push’s communication layer is powering the D_D community.\n\n### Hi Krinza, how did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What’s your story?\nKrinza: Before joining web3 full-time, I was working in my capacity as a data scientist building AI products. My first year working in that role was all fun and games until the work started to feel redundant. It was no longer about the thrill of solving a problem anymore, but the drudgery of making the exact pipelines run in similar ways or applying them to different problems.\n\nThis made me start exploring blockchain in my spare time. I was already enveloped in crypto and had explored the NFT space to its fullest. Yet, it was really when I joined the Developer DAO earlier in March 2022 that things started to pull me down the rabbit hole and I became hooked to web3.\n\nNow I work for this project called \nAnkr, where we are building a decentralized multichain web3 infrastructure and dev tools for developers and enterprises to experience the potential of blockchain without doing any heavy lifting themselves.\n\n### Tell us about Developer DAO — what’s it about, and what problem does D_D solve?\nKrinza: Developer DAO is a tokenized community of web3 builders and developers. We’re all about creating public goods, offering educational opportunities, and helping developers level up their careers.\n\n<blockquote><i>One of the main problems that Developer DAO solves is the lack of resources and support for new web3 developers to explore and build in this space. DevDAO has been a soft ground for most of us in kickstarting our careers in web3.</i></blockquote>\n\n### What’s your 2023 plan for D_D?\nKrinza: 2023 plan for Developer DAO is to keep on contributing to the organization’s growth and development while ensuring we engage with members outside of the community and give them a platform to learn and grow with us. This will happen through a couple of initiatives we are launching this quarter that will get builders to attend their first hackathons (Build Scholarships), get the right kind of resources and mentorship (DevRel Incubation), and eventually full-time jobs in web3 (DevDao Jobs).\n\n### How is D_D using Push’s web3 communication layer?\nKrinza: We have recently plugged Push Protocol to add another layer of notification, and we’re super excited to see all the awesome ways we can use it. Right now, we’re thinking about sending notifications for things like new proposals on Snapshot and new topic creations on our forum. But we can also think about reminder pings for when proposal voting is about to end and notifications for our newsletter and new blog posts on DevDAO Hashnode. The possibilities are endless, and we can’t wait to see what we come up with!\n\n### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\nKrinza: The experience with Push has been smooth, which has allowed us to make the community members informed of the on-chain activities. It is easy to integrate and offers many benefits to bring the community together in a much more secure manner.\n\nSpecial shout-out to Harsh, Fabio, and Jun for always being available to engage with the DevDAO community.\n\n### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\nKrinza: Supporting more chains, and eventually onboarding more ecosystems!\n\n### What do you usually do (for fun) besides web3? :)\nKrinza: Ah — lots of random things. I’ve recently started to skip rope and of course more traveling.\n\nThank you so much Krinza. You’re truly awesome! We can’t wait to see how this journey goes for D_D and Push.\n\nAbout Developer DAO\nDevDAO is a community of web3 builders working towards creating a better internet.

As our ambitions grew beyond just notifications, we felt we needed a brand refresh that would better accommodate our vision of becoming web3’s most widely used communication protocol.\n\nAnd so far, people seem to love it.\n\n<iframe width=\"567\" height=\"319\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiC-nbg9Iuk\" title=\"EPNS Rebrands into Push Protocol — the Communication Protocol for Web3\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nA fantastic rebrand however needs similarly fantastic project developments behind it. This started included:\n\n- Push going live on [Ethereum](https://medium.com/push-protocol/the-epns-mainnet-is-here-470faec0c01) mainnet in January.\n- Completed our Series A round and honored to have some amazing [investors](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1514632659514798081) help us realize our vision.\n- Many exciting product developments followed including the launch of the [SNS](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-sns-for-push-delivery-nodes-quickest-way-to-bootstrap-your-wallet-app-or-any-c88017595e09) module for Push Delivery Nodes and the release of [SDK monorepo](https://medium.com/push-protocol/here-comes-the-all-new-epns-sdk-monorepo-framework-8447b486a801) structure. Both these developments were aimed at creating a seamless experience for developers.\n- We launched on [Polygon](https://blockworks.co/news/polygon-onboards-new-web3-native-communication-network), adding it to our expanding list of supported chains.\n- Our most awaited product, [Push Chat](https://medium.com/push-protocol/were-still-pushing-a-deeper-look-into-push-chat-90fdea8d9e8e) went live in alpha and with it, we took a huge step in facilitating wallet-to-wallet communication in web3.\n\nSince going live with all these features, we’ve seen increased adoption and utility of the Push protocol.\n\n## Push by the Numbers📈\n2022 saw more notifications, live channels, and channel subscribers than we’ve ever had before.\n\nAs we’ve continued to refine, improve, and develop our communication tools, more protocols are harnessing the power of notifications than ever before — and we’re happy to be leading the way. In fact, in Q1 and Q3 Push saw more than 20%+ QoQ growth.\n\nWe went [live on Polygon in September](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-protocol-launches-on-polygon-enabling-communication-for-thousands-of-dapps-1c49d7c996f8) and [live on Lens in October](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-and-lens-powering-ux-with-notifications-and-aaves-lens-85828638e691), giving Push a huge boost in the way of reach and utility.\n\nHere’s a look at the numbers:\n\n![Push Growth](./image-1.png)\n<ImageText>Push Growth Overview</ImageText>\n\n![Notifications](./image-2.png)\n<ImageText>Number of Push Notifications — Powered by </ImageText>\n\n## The Push Fam Continues to Expand 🌱\n2022 was a fantastic year for making new frens and building new partnerships. Some of the most renowned projects in the web3 space joined forces with us to enable decentralized communication on their dApps.\n\nWe are thrilled to be working with some of the most ambitious projects in web3 and enabling native web3 communication for their protocols.\n\nHere’s a look at our ecosystem today:\n\n![Ecosystem](./image-3.png)\n<ImageText>Frens of Push 2022</ImageText>\n\n## IRL Events🛠️\n2022 kept us busy with a long list of conferences and events. We were honored to be able to attend some of the most prestigious conferences and hackathons this year and get to meet a lot of our community in person.\n\nWe attended ETHDenver, Devconnect, ETHAmsterdam, ETHNewYork, EthCC, Unfold, Devcon Bogotá, ETHSF, and ETHIndia, and co-hosted [Zero-to-Dapp conference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyWTqFLqKt9ZJOmEsEbkrn1nPCy69INhl) along with The Graph, Arbitrum, and Router.\n\nNeedless to say, it was a busy year with tons of new projects building with Push and bounties being won.\n\n![Developer Adoption](./image-4.png)\n<ImageText>Developer Adoption of Push in 2022</ImageText>\n\nThank you to everyone who invited us to teach, discuss, and demo our ideas, as well as everyone who showed up to the events to meet the Push team and build using Push.\n\nHere are a few sights from hackathons this year:\n\n![EthIndia1](./image-5.jpg)\n![EthIndia2](./image-6.jpg)\n![EthIndia3](./image-7.jpg)\n![EthIndia4](./image-8.jpg)\n\n\n## Push in the News📰\nWith all the progress Push had this year, publications took note. A host of our launches and collaborations were featured in a variety of prominent publications.\n\nSome of our favorite headlines were:\n\n- CoinDesk: [EPNS Goes Live in Bid to Bring Notifications to Web 3](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/11/epns-goes-live-in-bid-to-bring-notifications-to-web-3/)\n- CoinDesk: [Ethereum Push Notification Service Raises $10M at $131M Valuation](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/14/ethereum-push-notification-service-raises-10m-at-131m-valuation/)\n- Benzinga: [Ethereum’s Communication Layer EPNS: Interview With Co-Founder Harsh Rajat At EthCC 5 Paris](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/07/28227776/ethereums-communication-layer-epns-interview-with-co-founder-harsh-rajat-at-ethcc-5-paris)\n- Blockworks: [Polygon Onboards New Web3-native Communication Network](https://blockworks.co/news/polygon-onboards-new-web3-native-communication-network)\n\n## Our Community, Our Strength🤝\nCommunity is everything for Push, and 2022 would not have been such a successful year without your help. To all the devs who built using Push, all $PUSH token holders, and users who subscribe to channels — we thank you for being a part of our community!\n\nTo foster our community’s growth, we started the [Push Grants Program](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-grants-program-its-here-f2bfba29388f) earlier this year with the goal of funding builders in the web3 space. With feedback and learnings from the first iteration of the program, [PGP v2.0](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1604867953190739973) went live later this year and we’ve seen tons of projects begin to apply.\n\n![PGP V2](./image-9.webp)\n\nBeyond just community growth, we also wanted to better involve the community in the improvement of Push. To streamline feature requests, we launched [Push Improvement Proposal](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-push-improvement-proposal-pip-702c44fc24f6) to create an open forum to discuss proposals for standardized, community-driven improvements in the Push ecosystem.\n\n![PIP](./image-10.webp)\n\nPush now has new initiatives for fostering Push notifications and chat integration, community-led improvements to the protocol, and community growth.\n\nWe have no doubt setting these initiatives up in 2022 is going to lead to a massive year for us in 2023!\n\n## You’re the Real Rockstars👨‍🎤\nWe launched the second version of Push Rockstars this year: Rockstars Of Push Vol. 2 and had 24 winners to date, 100+ submissions, and over 20M+ of $PUSH token voting!\n\nFrom educational threads to YouTube demos, the Push community never failed to surprise us with fantastic Push-related content.\n\nThanks to all the Rockstars of Push for your love and ongoing support.\n\n## What’s Next for Us?🚀\nAs always, we continue to build.\n\nEverything we’ve done this year has been a stepping stone to prepare us for a massive 2023. We’ll be looking to set new records for Push integrations, utility, and partnerships, all while bringing exciting new developments that best serve the communication needs of web3.\n\nHappy Holidays from the Push team, and we look forward to building with you in 2023.\n\n![Offsite](./image-11.jpg)\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

What are you working on now?\n<b>Anton:</b> I’ve been in the space since 2016, and I think that everyone would agree that there are human years, and there are crypto years. Down the rabbit hole, time feels different. I love this space, and I live it. What do I do here? I’m a builder. I love experimenting, I love building the tech. My passion is building simple products that solve complex problems. Mover is just that.\n\n## Tell us about Mover — what’s it about, and what problem do you guys solve?\n<b>Anton:</b> <a href=\"https://viamover.com/\">Mover</a> is a web3 primitives platform. We created the first crypto debit card that supports web3 primitives. What’s that? Well, Push Protocol is a primitive. It is a communication layer primitive. Lending, savings, options, derivatives, NFTs — all of them are primitives. So in other words, <b>Mover allows you to use your favorite crypto network or protocol in your day-to-day finance</b>.\n\n## What is Mover’s plan for 2023?\n<b>Anton:</b> A new card, more networks, more primitives, and instant cash out! That is to name a few upcoming things.\n\n<blockquote><i>Our goal is very simple, we want to offer one debit card for all web3. One card for all crypto natives: those who contribute to a DAO, those who trade on DEXs, those who trade decentralized options, those who collect NFTs, those who mint NFTs, those who create NFTs, and many more. We are here to create THE web3 card.</i></blockquote>\n\n## How is Mover using Push’s web3 communication layer?\n<b>Anton:</b> Currently, there are over 786 notifications sent to subscribers on our vault contracts. The notifications help users get real-time updates on when they receive their yield.\n\nYou can opt-in to the Mover channel here:\n\n[Push App (Previously EPNS)](https://app.push.org/?source=post_page-----d1c05c90f736--------------------------------#/channels?channel=0xb754601d2C8C1389E6633b1449B84CcE57788566)\n\n## How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\n<b>Anton:</b> We have been a customer and user of Push since the very beginning! Our mission has always been to push the boundaries of decentralized and permissionless system, while making everyday finance easier. <b>Push Protocol is an important part of making our mission easier.</b> Our experience has always been smooth. Only in web3 you can meet up and say “how about this?” and the other protocol is “sounds good, let’s push it”, and later that day it’s already running on-chain.<br/><br/>\n\nMover is built by engineers and active web3 users. So our first and immediate benefit was the fact that our users can be notified of on-chain activity in the vaults, bringing us closer to the ease of web2 services.\n\n## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\n<b>Anton:</b> Web3 native customer support, debit card top-up alerts, and more!\n\nWhat haven’t we asked you about that you wish we had?\nAnton: Our question to the Push team: what is that one missing piece in personal finance that you wish existed today? How can Mover and Push make web3 a native place even offline?\n\nGreat questions, Anoton! Let’s talk about it on your pod in Jan :) And thank you for taking the time to speak with us. We look forward to building communication infrastructure on Mover and powering a truly global DeFi adoption.\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n### About Mover\nMover is a DeFi savings account that allows users to trade, store, send, and earn interest on their crypto in a simple wallet with a debit card.\n\nTo learn more about Mover: [Website](https://viamover.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/viaMover), [Telegram](https://t.me/viaMover), [GitHub](https://github.com/viamover).\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nLaunched in early October, [Push Chat](https://app.push.org/#/chat) is providing secure and instant communication for all by connecting users and dapps across web3.\n\nIn this article, we deep dive into how Push Chat works and its use case.\n\nPush Chat is still in alpha and we’re gradually rolling out early access to all of you. If you want to skip the line and become one of the first builders to try out Push Chat — keep reading 👀\n\n## What Is Push Chat?\n[Push Chat](https://app.push.org/#/chat) is a secure messaging protocol built by Push Protocol. Messages are encrypted, signed, and stored on IPFS and they are sent through Push Nodes.\n\n<i>Note: The team is continuing to develop the Push Protocol including notification and chat for wallets regardless of any chain in web3 in a multichain, platform-agnostic, and gasless way. Push Chat is the next offering of the protocol after push notifications and is currently available on Ethereum and Polygon with other chain support to follow soon.</i>\n\n## Why Push Chat now?\nPush Chat and video were imagined by us in 2020 but we knew that before notifications become a reality, doing chat or video will just become a novelty as everything we do in our virtual lives starts out with a notification.\n\nFor example, you don’t chat on WhatsApp as much as you chat via notifications on WhatsApp, the same is the case with Facetime. Owing to this, Push created notifications for web3 first which paved the way for real-time communication mediums to become a possibility.\n\nPush Protocol’s vision has remained to be the de-facto layer of communication for the entire web3 and Push Chat (with native push notification support) helps in wrapping another milestone to bring the UX of web3 on par with web2.\n\n## How Push Chat works?\nPush Chat uses IPFS, encryption, and pinning of the messages on Push Nodes to enable a seamless, no-message drop experience for the user. Each message (and notification) carries a verification proof which the front-end can use to determine that the message content and sender are actually the ones that sent these messages out. You can read about notification verification proofs and the various supported formats here:\n\n[PIPs/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification at main · ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification?source=post_page-----90fdea8d9e8e--------------------------------)\n\n## What are Push Nodes?\n<i><b>Push Nodes</b></i> are a network of nodes, where each node can have a different role in the network that is responsible for validating and dispatching each notification and chat message between addresses.\n\nTheir main task is to validate that:\n\n- the payload is following the corresponding payload standard,\n- the sender can actually send the message, and signature validation,\n- if the payload is valid, the Push Nodes will store the message on IPFS and then send a notification to the receiver of the message.\n<i>Note: Push Nodes are in alpha right now and are currently run by the push protocol team with an alpha version of these nodes scheduled to come out around Q1 / Q2 of 2023.</i>\n\n## Who is currently running Push Nodes?\nThe Push team currently runs the Push Nodes for Push Chat. The team is working towards decentralizing the network every day by making progress in establishing the underlying primitives for the Push Protocol. This is only until the team fully bootstraps the Push Protocol and the protocol and Push Chat are production ready.\n\nOnce the network becomes fully decentralized, Push Nodes will be incentivized to maintain the network, be readily addressable, and provide message content through $PUSH tokens which are native tokens of the protocol.\n\n<i>Read about Push Economics here:</i><br/><br/>\n\n[Push Token Economics](https://docs.push.org/hub/pusheconomics/push-token-economics?source=post_page-----90fdea8d9e8e--------------------------------)\n\n\n## How Does a User Send a Message Using Their Account Address?\nA user of Push Chat has two sections: <i><b>Chats and Requests.</b></i>\n\nUsers sending a message to another address for the first time will be the first subject to the Request type until the receiving address accepts the message. Then, messages and notifications from that address will appear in the receiving addresses chats section. Eventually, users will be able to block addresses. Receiving addresses aren’t notified about messages in the Request box. This prevents users from receiving messages from any random address that sends them a message and general spam.\n\nIf a message is sent to an address that hasn’t been authenticated yet on the Push Protocol, those messages will be in plain text until the receiving address authenticates itself.\n\n![Push Chat](./image-1.webp)\n<ImageText>Push Chat: <a href=\"https://app.push.org/#/chat\">https://app.push.org/#/chat</a></ImageText>\n\n## Where are messages stored?\nPush Nodes store all messages sent over the network. Any Push Node can expose locally stored messages to the network, which other Push Nodes can connect to and fetch. The nodes can then push these messages to a user’s public address. Each message is stored on IPFS along with its verification proof which allows the frontends to verify that the content of the message indeed originated from the sender and not from anyone else.\n\n## Are messages safe, and is the network secure?\nPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is an encryption method that provides privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP encryption keys are generated for every address on the network. Learn more about P2P encryption here.\n\nThe PGP public key is used to encrypt the content sent using asymmetric encryption. This ensures that the encrypted message payload can only be decrypted by the receiver and no other third party can decrypt or see the content of the message.\n\nNote: The encryption method used here is future-proof, as other methods can encrypt the keys and adapt to newer cryptography.\n\n## Does this apply to notifications? How do notifications fit into all this?\nChat while an integral part of any application works best when notifications are integrated into it natively. Most of the time, whenever we are chatting either on Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, or anywhere else, we usually don’t have the application open. Instead, we reply to a message and then go on doing other activities until the other person replies which we receive as a notification.\n\nPush Chat uses this exact web2 UX to ensure that the web3 user finally gets the same experience as that of a web2 user by utilizing the native push notifications capabilities of Push Protocol to send a notification out to the wallet address if the wallet address has approved the request of the sender wallet.\n\n## Push Working Towards Decentralization\nApplications need to protect users and their data and remove censorship. The Push team is privileged to tackle a fundamental problem in the new web (such as the poor user experience and a subliminal communication layer).\n\nTo achieve decentralization, the Push team has broken that into two phases, one is content can’t be changed and the other one is content can’t be censored.\n\n### 1) Content can’t be changed\nWith verification proof, the immutability of the content is always ensured (1), read more here:\n\n[PIPs/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification at main · ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification?source=post_page-----90fdea8d9e8e--------------------------------)\n\n### 2) Content can’t be censored\nThis is achieved by developing Push Nodes that enables anyone to run the node in a permissionless way with PoS to incentivize and penalize behavior. Alpha Push Nodes are scheduled to happen somewhere between Q1 / Q2 of 2023.\n\n## Push-ing Real Solutions for Web3\nYes, the user experience in web3 needs much work, and to be frank, it is likely years out from where it should be. That is why the Push team is focusing on a protocol that tackles the problem from the ground up, a grassroots solution, and a primary reason why web3 is the next iteration of the web — improving how we interact.\n\nWhen a sufficient number of dapps and services in web3 implement Push chat, it enables a new wave of use cases and scales coordination because now messaging and notifications are web-wide and not in isolation to dapps and their users.\n\nDapps can use event-driven computation to communicate off-chain or on-chain with one another and enable fully-scaled coordination. Dapps also don’t have to worry about maintaining the underlying infrastructure to push messages which takes the load off developers, and the network guarantees message integrity.\n\n### We mean it — let’s scale communication\nWe previously described how you could use Push Protocol for various use cases in web3, such as in [governance](https://medium.com/push-protocol/an-introduction-to-push-notification-part-2-2-governance-use-cases-1ea1e0a58ce1). While Push allows for these great capabilities, the truth is that many web3 governance systems lack participation. Many DAOs depend on a few contributors and have a central source of truth, and there is still a disconnect between DeFi and the user. User coordination generates high-value sources of truth. We can see this with the effectiveness of crowdfunding, the pooling of knowledge, funds, and resources, novel voting methods, petitions, and even zero-knowledge primitives. An easily adaptable communication stack and an ambitious outlook are a step in the right direction.\n\nImagine a web-wide poll about a major topic that anyone around the world can participate in. The poll is guaranteed to be censorship-resistant and verifiable, all while properly incentivizing those who participated and curated the poll with their resources. This scratches the surface of the coordination capabilities of a web3-native messaging protocol.\n\n### Push your dapp\nYour application and the users of web3 deserve robust communication. Push Chat can help. Here is a summary of its key features:\n\n- <b>Push Chat is permissionless:</b> the production-ready version will allow any address on any platform to use their account (address) to chat with any other account across web3. Users aren’t required to sign up anywhere.\n- <b>Push Chat is forward-compatible:</b> Push Chat can adapt to any changes made to existing platforms or new ones that arise, as the messaging functionality will not rely on the underlying platform the messages are sent and received from.\n- <b>Push Chat is user-friendly:</b> Push Chat is a friendly and familiar-facing user experience that current users appreciate.\n- <b>Push Chat is developer-friendly:</b> Using the Push chat SDK, developers can add a messaging layer to their application or service. The message type is JSON, making it easy for developers to consume and interpret. Developers can integrate push chat into the development workflow and improve their CI/CD processes. Test and deployment results can be pushed as messages to user wallets.\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\nPssssssst 🤫\n\nThanks for making it this far.\n\nIf you’re interested in exploring how Push Chat can boost user engagement and benefit your project, please:\n\n- Share this article\n- Join our Discord [#push-chat-alpha channel](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), and tell us what you’re building, we’ve got devs who can help give consultation and we’ll be sharing exclusive Push Chat access to Discord members soon!\n- To get started building right away, head over to the [Push Chat developer docs](https://docs.push.org/developers/concepts/push-chat-for-web3).\n\nSee you soon on Push Chat!\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

If you want to be featured, reach out to us and you could be our next Fren in the series.</i>\n\n[Tollan Worlds](https://medium.com/u/5afd7b03aba2?source=post_page-----ba3f9697523--------------------------------), a web3 gaming platform, has joined forces with Push to power communication on their platform.\n\nBlockchain gaming is leading the growth of the gaming industry. To enable more transparency in the gaming ecosystem, Tollan Worlds is bringing decentralized communication to its platform.\n\nBy integrating Push, Tollan Worlds is able to regularly announce development updates, new partnerships, community events, and giveaways to the gamer community directly.\n\nIn the fourth segment of ‘Frens of Push,’ we are in conversation with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/im_mkx\"><b>Michael Kuvshynov</b></a>, co-founder and CEO of Tollan Worlds, to talk about how Push is enabling communication on the gaming platform. For all the gamers — if you’d like to play Tollan Worlds and here’s the good news, the Tollan Worlds team is giving away <b>exclusive 30 access codes</b>. How to get the code? Keep reading!\n\n## Hi Michael, what’s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\n<b>Michael:</b> My blockchain journey started a few years ago. Coming from computer science and game design backgrounds as well as creating various content as a hobby, I saw the tremendous potential Web3 can bring to each of these directions. Kernel from Gitcoin has been my gateway into the decentralized world and taught me a lot about the values of the new web, most importantly about the sense of community and the power of decentralization on an ethical level. I believe whoever wants to start building in Web3 should stop asking what Web3 could do for them and instead ask what they could do for Web3.<br/><br/>\n\n<blockquote>Gaming was always my passion, and I’ve seen it as one of the biggest use cases for blockchain and especially NFT technologies. And here we are, building a pixel art MMO we call Tollan Worlds.</blockquote>\n\n## Tell us about Tollan Worlds — what’s it about, and what problem does Tollan Words solve?\n<b>Michael:</b> Tollan Worlds is an online role-playing game where you play as an escapee from an authoritarian city with an imperial mentality called <i>The Mainland</i>. Finding your way through endless Darklands and finally stumbling upon a hidden developing society in the middle of nowhere. That’s where your journey finally begins.\n\nPlayers will shape their own path through the main story as well as go to dungeons with their friends and join forces with many other players for massive boss fights. They can explore the vast world where each new place brings new creatures, stories, and unforgettable experiences while being determined to the main objective of defending their new home from the ubiquitous forces of The Mainland.\n\nOur main goal is not only to create great gameplay with a deep story but also to create a fair and transparent monetization model while also putting players in charge of their game world, and blockchain allows us to achieve that.\n\nTollan Worlds “solves the problem” of both traditional and blockchain gaming worlds. Transparent monetization allows us to be closer to our player base and develop trust and long-term retention of our community. Focusing on the gameplay and story, and escaping Ponzi play2earn schemes allows us to create a game that doesn’t depend on market conditions and where money does not interfere with the core gameplay.\n\n<iframe width=\"567\" height=\"319\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MOJ4hSdbiD0\" title=\"Tollan Worlds: The First Adventure Teaser\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## How do people play Tollan Worlds?\n<b>Michael:</b> Our pre-alpha is currently live for a limited amount of users, with only 6,000 spots available.

We regularly announced development updates, new partnerships, community events, and giveaways there. Now that we are planning a multiplayer experience, we are looking forward to integrating push even deeper into Tollan Worlds.\n\n## How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\n<b>Michael:</b> Push was easy to use and a great way to communicate with our community in a decentralized and secure way. It is extremely easy to integrate and has so many benefits that are definitely worth the time.\n\n## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\n<b>Michael: We believe Push has tremendous potential across a diverse array of applications, especially games.</b> Imagine having a secure and decentralized in-game chat or being able to receive in-game notifications about clan invitations or trade proposals to your wallet address.\n\n## 🎁 Tollan Worlds Pre-alpha Codes Giveaway 🎁\nFrom December 15th to December 20th, please follow three simple rules:\n\n1.

Here’s what to expect from the update.<br/>\n\nPush Protocol is elated to announce the successful completion of the [security audit of our smart contracts v1.5](https://github.com/ChainSafe/audits/blob/main/EPNS/epns-protocol-11-2022.pdf) with Chainsafe.\n\nThe completion of this audit was one of the most significant roadmap items for this year. We couldn’t be happier to share with you all that our version 1.5 of Core and Communicator smart contracts have been successfully audited by Chainsafe.\n\nOur [initial plan](https://medium.com/push-protocol/epns-contract-v2-features-e7887fac72a6) was to release Push v2 all at once in 2022. However, we decided to split up the upgrade into v1.5 and v2 in order to ensure adequate time for development, testing, and auditing. The decision allowed us to drive forward with this launch of v1.5 while continuing to build v2\n\nVersion 1.5 of Push smart contracts includes imperative functionalities that will provide better features to users and also improve the overall utility of the PUSH token. Below, we recap six of the most critical new functionalities of the Push Core and Communicator smart contracts in v1.5.\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n## 1) Enhancing the PUSH token utility through channel creation\nOne of the most significant modifications in v1.5 of the Push smart contract can be found in the channel creation procedure. In v1 of the core contract design, channel creators were required to deposit DAI to launch a channel. In v1.5, the protocol removes the need to deposit DAI. <b>Instead, all channels will now be created using PUSH</b>.\n\nAdditionally, v1.5 of Push smart contracts will also deprecate the use of AAVE, which was previously used to deposit DAI tokens and earn interests.\n\nAll crucial transactions of core smart contracts like <i>channel creations, channel reactivation or deactivation, and channel details modifications</i> will require PUSH with the launch of v1.5.\n\n## 2) Incentivizing the network with the PUSH Protocol Fee Pool\nVersion 1.5 of Push smart contracts will introduce the concept of <b>Protocol Fee Pool</b>. So, what exactly is a Protocol Fee Pool?\n\nThe protocol fee is a small fee amount deducted by the core smart contract for any imperative transaction like channel creation, channel reactivation, channel detail modification, and others.\n\nAs of now, the protocol fee is set to be equal to <b>10 PUSH tokens</b>. This value, however, can be changed by the community later using on-chain governance.\n\n<b>Note for Channel Creators:</b>\n\nIt must be noted that this is not an additional fee that is charged on top of channel creation fees. Instead, the protocol fee is simply deducted from the same amount that a channel creator chooses to stake in the protocol. For example, if you chose to stake 50 PUSH during channel creation, 10 of those 50 PUSH tokens go into Protocol Fee Pool, while the remaining goes into Channel Pool Funds that are claimable by channel owners anytime they choose to deactivate their channel.\n\nThe Protocol Fee Pool is going to play an imperative role in the incentivization mechanism of the core smart contracts, which will allow PUSH holders and users of the protocol to also earn incentives from the protocol in the form of PUSH.\n\nSince the incentives will be directly tied to the protocol’s fee pool, this would mean that the more the protocol expands its boundaries, the better the incentives for users that they can claim from the contracts.\n\n## 3) Enabling more flexibility and customization with time-bound channels\nWith this new version of smart contracts, v1.5 will introduce another amazing feature that allows users to create time-bound channels.<b>Time-bound channels</b> are the ones that can be created for a specific duration of time and can easily be removed once the duration is over.\n\nDiving a bit deeper into this function: while the underlying channel creation procedure is similar, this feature allows users to pass an additional parameter — the date of expiry of the channel — to the already existing channel creation function. This is what indicates that a time-bound channel with a predefined expiration date is to be created. Once the channel’s duration is over, the channel creator can destroy the channel and get the staked tokens back.\n\nFinally, the original creator can recreate the channel using the same address after destroying the previous time-bound channel. This was not possible till now with permanent channels.\n\n## 4) Allowing for upgrades and adjustments with channel edit features\nV1.5 brings with it a much-awaited feature: the ability to modify your channel details! Descriptions, logo, information, etc.\n\nWhile editing channels is a simple feature, there were a specific set of reasons why this wasn’t made available until v1.5.\n\nIdeally, modifying channel details repeatedly is not a behaviour that is encouraged. Editing and modifying channel details could allow a malicious channel owner to update details and confuse subscribers, impersonating important DeFi or governance channels, for example.\n\nHowever, since this feature was an important one for the community and users, we included this feature in v1.5 of the smart contracts along with the crucial steps to avoid the above-mentioned scenario.\n\n<b>💰 Channel Edit Fees 💰:</b>\n\nEditing channel details requires fees to be deposited. This fee shall keep increasing if the channel owner repeatedly updates their channel name, logo, description, etc.\n\n<b>⚠️ Warning Sign ⚠️:</b>\n\nWhenever a channel owner modifies any specific detail about their channel on the protocol, the channel shall appear with an additional note/warning in the dApp UI. This note will inform the rest of the users as well as subscribers about the channel’s old name or description.\n\n## 5) Enabling notifications using The Graph subgraph\nPush has developed an in-house helper function specifically for The Graph protocol that allows you to read events from the subgraph and define notifications accordingly. Once defined, they will be stored on the Subgraph in a “long string” format.\n\nThis function shall simply allow users to pass subGraph data, in the form of bytes, which is basically a combination of the Subgraph ID and Poll Interval. It emits out the event with the msg.sender and the bytes value.\n\nThe function shall only be accessible by the activated channels in the protocol.\n\n## 6) Including of EIP-1271 in the Push Communicator contract\nAlright, now that we have talked about quite a few new features in the Push Core smart contracts, it’s time to discuss the Push Communicator smart contract.\n\nAlthough the communicator contract doesn’t have a lot of new features in this version, it has one major feature worth discussing. The v1.5 of Push Communicator smart contract implements <b>EIP-1271</b>.\n\n<b>What is EIP-1271?</b>\n\nIn very simpler terms, EIP 1271 provides a standard to verify signatures that come from the account which is a smart contract address instead of an EOA address.\n\nWhile externally-owned accounts (EOA) can easily sign messages with their associated private keys, smart contracts can’t do the same (since they don’t have any private keys). However, with the help of the EIP-1271 standard, we have an effective mechanism by which a contract can indicate whether a given signature is valid or not on its behalf. Read more about EIP-1271 [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271).\n\nSome of the crucial features of the Push Protocol communicator contract are now carried out off-chain. For example, opting in or opting out of a channel or sending notifications are now fairly easy procedures as all you need to do is sign a message using your EOA.\n\nHowever, now with EIP-1271 implementation in the communicator contract, it shall be fairly simple for wallets like Argent wallet, multi-sigs like Gnosis safe, or smart contracts to validate signatures on their behalf and use these features as well.\n\n<b>Preparing for the future with Push v1.5</b>\n\nA lot of development has gone into reaching this moment with Push v1.5. We’re thrilled by all the support from the community. V1.5 is one of the most important upgrades the protocol has undergone. Updates to channel creation and fees create more nuanced utility for the PUSH token and ecosystem. Time-bound and editable channels deliver much-requested customization to users. The integration with The Graph and EIP-1271 demonstrate Push’s commitment to best-in-class technology standards and partners. We’re thrilled for the Push community to welcome v1.5 soon, while we continue to build out Push v2 and deliver that to the community in the near future!\n\n<b>Note:</b>\n\nThe Push Core and Communicator smart contracts will be upgraded to version 1.5 by January 2023. All the above-mentioned modifications and new features will come into effect post the upgrade.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

Push will begin enabling notifications for Developer DAO members to be notified of new proposals, voting end periods, and relevant announcements and content.\n2. The [official push notifications channel](https://app.push.org/) for D_D will go live on Dec 13th.\n3. Push will be conducting [a workshop](https://lu.ma/d-d-push-protocol-workshop) on Dec 14th at 5:00 PM UTC to showcase how you can integrate notifications and chat functionality into your dapps\n4. There will be a surprise for all D_D members (if you join the workshop, you’ll be the first to know :)\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\nIf you’re a Web3 enthusiast who envisions an internet that is free and collectively owned, <a href=\"https://www.developerdao.com/\"><b>Developer DAO</b></a> is the community for you. With over 5000 members from around the world, D_D continues to accelerate its mission of empowering a new wave of Web3 builders through constant innovations and educational efforts.\n\nWe are excited to have Developer DAO as a part of the Push ecosystem and look forward to enhancing the community experience via decentralized communication. This is only the start of an amazing journey with D_D!\n\n## Developer DAO X Push: What to expect\nFacilitating a culture of “learning and growing together” is a cornerstone mission of D_D. With this in mind, the importance of streamlined community participation and governance is critical to the community’s success. This is where Push comes in.\n\nPush Protocol addresses this user experience problem by providing a communication layer for wallets and dapps. Push allows any dapp, smart contract, backend, protocol, or, in principle, any distributed technology to send communication directly to user wallet addresses in an open and decentralized way. Being an open and permissionless protocol, anyone can create dedicated channels to distribute information directly to user wallets without needing to rely on centralized service providers.\n\n### Push x D_D channel soon!\nBy creating a communication channel for D_D members, Push aims to encourage maximum participation by DAO members. Push will notify:\n\n- When there is a new proposal on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth)\n- 24 hrs before the proposal voting ends\n- When there is a new Proposal topic created on the [D_D forum](https://forum.developerdao.com/c/proposals/5)\n- When a Substack newsletter or blog post is live\n\nD_D official channel will be live on [Push](https://app.push.org/) on Dec 13th. Members can simply opt-in and stay up-to-date with all the latest updates from Developer DAO.\n\nKeep an eye out for all the surprises and exclusive events we have for the D_D community.\n\n### Push workshop: Power your Web3 app with Push\nWe’re pulling together an awesome <b>1-hour workshop</b> for the D_D community with our founder [Harsh](https://twitter.com/harshrajat) and core dev [Fabio](https://twitter.com/learn4life6).\n\nWhether you are just entering the space, an experienced developer, or an indie hacker, we will help you understand our tech and learn how to use Push Protocol to power your web3 app through a hands-on workshop.

Traditionally, we might be recognized as a provider of Index products, enabling diversification across multiple crypto assets.\n\n<a href=\"https://indexcoop.com/blog/index-coop-the-next-chapter?source=post_page-----a72fc7be86e8--------------------------------\"><b>Meet Our Upcoming Products</b></a>\n\n## How do people use Index Coop?\n<b>Brad:</b> Pending compliance with all local jurisdictions and regulations, people can access Index Coop products directly through popular dApps and exchanges like Uniswap and Sushi. We’re also listed through Coinbase and the amazing Argent wallet.\n\nOr directly through our own website app: https://app.indexcoop.com/\n\nIf anyone has more questions, they can jump into our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/indexcoop) and meet with our community and community managers.\n\n## What’s your future plan for Index Coop?\n<b>Brad:</b> Directly from: https://indexcoop.com/blog/index-coop-the-next-chapter\n\nSince launching over two years ago, the Index Coop has established itself as the leader in on-chain structured products. With over 80% of the market share of on-chain index products, we’ve experienced first-hand the many trends and cycles of DeFi. <b>During this period, our thesis has remained the same: on-chain products are the future and it’s up to us to make sure it includes everyone</b>. To that end, we’ve remained committed to building products that are accessible, secure, and simple to use.\n\nAs this industry has grown, the definitions of “simple” and “secure” have become ambiguous. Is DeFi simple when it takes ten steps to complete a transaction or must be monitored daily? Is it secure when promised yields disappear or when pegs falter? The next wave of DeFi will not look like the days of old. Traditional retail buyers and institutional capital will not behave like the degens of the past. Crypto must be held to a higher standard in order to onboard the next wave of users. Veteran DeFi users and traditional buyers alike expect performance. So, we must build for both performances and for sustainability.\n\nThe question then becomes: how does our industry deliver on the advancements and efficiencies of the on-chain world while still being simple and safe enough for the average user? Index Coop bridges this gap, allowing anyone to access sophisticated strategies. Our upcoming roadmap of products and enhancements captures the best advantages of DeFi while being secure and easy to use.\n\n## How is Index Coop using Push’s web3 communication layer?\n<b>Brad:</b> We plan to leverage the Push communication layer to provide a more seamless communication channel with our community and customer base.\n\nFirst, by providing high-level insights, notifications, and updates to our customers on the community on major product and new product updates.\n\nWe then intend to evolve our use of Push to provide more nuanced communication to our audience around specific product updates, rebalancing, etc.\n\n## How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\n<b>Brad:</b> We’re only new to the Push ecosystem! But we’ve already received positive feedback from customers who are grateful for the exploration of additional on-chain communication channels.\n\n## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\n<b>Brad:</b> Endless! <b>We see these on-chain, wallet-integrated communication channels as playing a huge role in the future of DeFi</b>. For an organization like ours, aggressively product-focused and always looking for ways to innovate and create infrastructure to improve DeFi access for a wider audience, on-chain communication and notifications will be extremely important and helpful.\n\n## What haven’t we asked you about that you wish we had?\n<b>Brad:</b> I’m sure we’ll catch up again soon with some additional updates!\n\nWe want to thank [Brad](https://twitter.com/bradwmorris) for speaking with us! We look forward to building with Index and cultivating better communication with their awesome coop. Stay tuned for more exciting developments from both Push and Index Coop!\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n### About Index Coop\nIndex Coop is a collective that provides broad exposure to DeFi, making the purchase of digital assets simpler and cost-effective.

If you want to be featured, reach out to us and you could be our next Fren in the series.</i><br/><br/>\n\n<a href=\"https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/\"><b>Cryptocurrency Jobs</b></a>, the leading job board for blockchain jobs, has teamed up with Push to enhance how users are notified and alerted of exciting new Web3 job opportunities!\n\nWeb3 has quickly become synonymous with innovation and provided a doorway to the development of many projects with vast potential. Many of these projects are expanding rapidly and looking to hire new talent. This is where Cryptocurrency Jobs enters the picture. By connecting Web3 professionals with leading blockchain-based companies from around the world, Cryptocurrency Jobs is helping bridge the hiring gap in Web3.\n\nThrough the collaboration with Push, the platform is bringing new job opportunities and updates to Web3 professionals directly. All this is made possible through decentralized Push notifications that users can opt-in to receive on their devices.\n\nIn the second episode of “Frens of Push”, we are in conversation with Daniel — the founder of Cryptocurrency Jobs, to talk about how Push is enabling a people-centric approach to hiring.\n\n## How did you become involved in building the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\n<b>Daniel:</b> Hi, I’m Daniel, the founder of Cryptocurrency Jobs. I began my journey in this space through the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies course on Coursera. Fun fact: it’s taught by the founders of Arbitrum. Falling down the rabbit hole, I wanted to get involved and contribute to the community so I launched Cryptocurrency Jobs in October 2017. <b>Since then, I’ve featured over 10,000 jobs at 1,000+ companies and startups and published 406 newsletter issues</b>. All for free and accessible to all. Since then Cryptocurrency Jobs has become the leading job board for blockchain and cryptocurrency jobs — entirely independent, bootstrapped, and run by me.\n\n## What’s your future plan for Cryptocurrency Jobs?\n<b>Daniel:</b> Cryptocurrency Jobs recently <a href=\"https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/blog/five-years-of-cryptocurrency-jobs-and-a-new-partnership/\">turned five</a>. As part of the milestone, I announced the newest partner to Cryptocurrency Jobs: Pantera Capital. Since 2013, Pantera Capital has invested in digital assets and blockchain companies. I’m excited to work with the team, support their portfolio companies, and help you find more opportunities to grow in this space. As I continue to build Cryptocurrency Jobs, I remain committed to making this a friendly place for people everywhere. That’s why all content will remain open and accessible to all. There will be no gatekeeping. Everyone is welcome, and you all have a place in crypto.\n\n## How is Cryptocurrency Jobs using Push’s Web3 communication layer?\n<b>Daniel:</b> Since 2021, I have been working with Push Protocol to help them find talented humans for their team. I recently started using Push’s Web3 communication layer to create a decentralized communication channel that allows direct interaction with the Cryptocurrency Jobs community. The <a href=\"https://medium.com/push-protocol/app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xde3e447E125FA2391DC9BCbfA0B821424422FEAF\">Cryptocurrency Jobs channel</a> is live on the Push Protocol platform, and you can subscribe to receive decentralized notifications about new job opportunities, the weekly newsletter, and more.\n\n## How would you describe your experience using Push Protocol? What benefits have you seen?\n<b>Daniel:</b> The onboarding and setup process has been seamless. The Push Protocol team are true rock stars. Special shout-out to Jaf and Muktanshu for their help guiding me through the process.<br/><br/>\n\n<blockquote>Using Push Protocol has opened up a new communication channel with my community and helped onboard new users to the crypto space.</blockquote><br/>\n\nWe want to thank Daniel for taking the time to speak with us! We look forward to building Cryptocurrency Jobs and facilitating thousands of Web3 professionals to land their dream jobs.\n\nStay tuned for more exciting developments from both Push and Cryptocurrency Jobs!\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n### About Cryptocurrency Jobs\nCryptocurrency Jobs curates the best new blockchain jobs at leading companies and startups that use blockchain technology.

In this series, we highlight outstanding projects who are building using Push and give them the spotlight. If you’re interested in being featured, reach out to us!</i><br/><br/>\n\nEarnifi, an airdrop aggregator platform designed to find unclaimed airdrops, has integrated Push to make airdrops more accessible to everyone!\n\nEver since the advent of DeFi, airdrops have become a popular marketing tool for protocols to incentivize early users. What started as a way to generate awareness about DeFi projects quickly resulted in providing momentum to the overall adoption of DeFi. The space, however, is now flooded with thousands of projects, leading to missed opportunities for claiming these airdrops. This is where Earnifi comes in.\n\nBy aggregating all available airdrops and bringing them to a single platform, Earnifi ensures you never miss out on an airdrop again.\n\nIn the first segment of “Frens of Push,” we sat down with Earnifi founder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DawsonBotsford\"><b>Dawson Botsford</b></a> to talk about how Push is furthering Earnifi’s “mission to find millions.”\n\n## How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\n<b>Dawson:</b> I first got into Bitcoin back in 2014, trying to make arbitrage bots. I quickly learned that finance was not enough for me and that smart contracts were the long-term answer to decentralized finance. After working in web2 for the next 5 years, I returned to Ethereum and got obsessed with web 2.5 applications during DeFi Summer.\n\nNowadays I run Earnifi, The Airdrop Platform. Earnifi has notified over $1 billion USD since it began in February 2021. Since I’m an indie hacker, I run this alone without other employees.\n\nIn addition to my work as the CEO of Earnifi I also hack in TONS of [ETHGlobal](https://medium.com/u/3d1733b8e86a?source=post_page-----9ee5805730f9--------------------------------) hackathons, run the developer podcast [dev3.fm](https://reflect.fm/anchor/dev-3), and publish open-source projects. I am most proud of Essential Eth, a replacement for Ethers.js that is 20x smaller.\n\n## How is Earnifi using Push’s web3 communication layer?\n<b>Dawson:</b> Earnifi uses Push daily as a part of the notification engine. Some people want email notifications, but others want mobile notifications, which is where Push comes in. <b>Earnifi has pushed over 100,000 messages via Push!</b>\n\n## How to use Earnifi?\n<b>Dawson:</b> If you arrive at Earnifi you can easily paste in any Ethereum or Cosmos address. Earnifi will quickly search you for 2,000 different assets, all within just a few seconds. Many of these assets are worth hundreds of dollars and are airdropped to you because you’re an early adopter. Even Push had a big airdrop when they first launched!\n\n## How would you describe your experience using Push Protocol? What benefits have you seen?\n<b>Dawson:</b> Push has been a blast to work with because it enables decentralized notifications. With just a few lines of JavaScript, I’m sending out hundreds of thousands of notifications without ever needing to store information about users.\n\n## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\nDawson: Push enables decentralized communication, so seeing the recent announcement of [Push Chat](https://app.push.org/#/chat) gets me super excited! Allowing more decentralized communication means that we can be better informed without needing to trust centralized parties.\n\n## What haven’t we asked you about that you wish we had? How is Earnifi giving back?\n<b>Dawson:</b> One thing Earnifi focuses heavily on is contributing to open-source code. You can see on <a href=\"https://earni.fi/oss\">https://earni.fi/oss</a> that Earnifi supports not just revoke.cash but many other projects to bring safety and speed to web3. The world deserves a fast web3, which is why there are several open-source projects Earnifi supports and grows through both code contributions and grants.<br/><br/>\n\nOnce again, we thank Dawson for taking the time to speak with us! We look forward to growing alongside Earnifi and helping your protocol deliver meaningful value to the Web3 community.\n\nStay tuned for more exciting developments from both Push and Earnifi!\n\nIf you’re looking to be featured by Push in one of our upcoming Frens of Push series, reach out to us and let us know!\n\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n### About Earnifi\nEarnifi is a solution for discovering and receiving notifications for unclaimed airdrops — this includes tokens, NFTs, and other claimable assets.

But, to service such a large ecosystem, there needs to be a streamlined process for improving and developing the ecosystem to meet every actor’s needs. Introducing — Push Improvement Proposals (PIP).\n\nPIP is a new standard for proposing improvements, specs, and standards to the Push ecosystem. The goal of PIPs is to provide a standardized, community-driven improvements, specs, and standards for improving the Push ecosystem. In this way, PIPs is going to become an integral part of how the Push ecosystem grows and evolves to best serve the needs of its users.\n\nCurious to know more about what PIPs are, how they’re processed, and why they matter? Read on to find out.\n\n## What is a PIP?\nPIP stands for Push Improvement Proposal. It is a standardized process that enables developers and community members alike to collaborate and make changes to the Push ecosystem. Inspired by the [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1) (Ethereum Improvement Proposal), PIP is a step towards broadening the scope of community participation in innovating the Push ecosystem.\n\nThere are three types of PIPs:\n\n1. <b>Standard</b> PIP describes any change that affects most or all Push ecosystem implementations, such as changes in core, interface, networking, or application level standards.\n2. <b>Meta</b> PIP describes a process surrounding Push or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process PIPs are like Standards Track PIPs but apply to areas other than the Push protocol itself. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Push development. Any <b>meta-PIP</b> is also considered a Process PIP.\n3. <b>Informational</b> PIP provides general guidelines or information to the Push community but does not propose a new feature. Informational PIPs do not necessarily represent a Push community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational PIPs or follow their advice.\n\n## Why do PIPs matter?\nPIPs play a central role in how changes happen and are documented in the Push ecosystem. They are the way for people to propose, debate, and adopt changes. There are [different types of PIPs](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/tree/main/definitions#type) including core PIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and improvements in API/RPC as well as PRCs for application standards. For example, [Verification Proof](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification/Verification) or [Identity](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification/Identity) for Notifications is described in PRC to create a standard.\n\n## What is the lifecycle of a PIP?\nJust like passing a new law, the approval process of a PIP involves various stages of discussion, editing, and review. Variations in this process are based on the type of proposal we have at hand and the timeline for discussion which might be set by the editor. In broad terms, all PIPs follow a standard process that includes the following steps:\n\n![Lifecycle](./image-1.png)\n\n1. <b>Ideation:</b> Any ideas for new changes or development of the Push ecosystem are presented and discussed over the <a href=\"https://gov.push.org/c/pip/29\">Push’s governance forum</a> or discord. If members find this idea worth pursuing, it is presented as a documented PIP to the larger community of Push developers.\n2. <b>Drafting:</b> This is the first formal step in proposal development where the authors of a new idea create a technical draft of their vision. To submit a draft, authors should submit a Pull Request (PR) against an issue in the PIPs repository.\n3. <b>Reviewing:</b> After the preliminary vetting process, a new draft is open for feedback from editors, reviewers, and any interested parties. This stage involves a large-scale audit of a given proposal where authors invite insights on their development plan from the Web3 community.\n4. <b>Last call:</b> This is the final window for the reviewing stage after which the PIP gets finalized. The editor provides a deadline (typically two weeks), after which a given proposal will not accept any new suggestions. In case any significant changes are needed, the proposal goes back to the reviewing stage.\n5. <b>Final:</b> After passing the last call stage, a proposal is accepted as a final or implementable standard. The only modifications at this point can be made to correct errata or add non-normative clarifications.\n\nIn certain cases, the lifecycle of a PIP can undergo special stages such as:\n\n<b>Stagnant:</b> Any proposal which remains inactive for a period of 4 months or more in the Draft/Review/Last Call state is considered stale. Such a proposal may be resurrected from this state by Authors or Editors who can move it back to an earlier status. If not resurrected, the proposal stays stagnant forever.\n\n<b>Withdrawn:</b> If the authors of a proposal withdraw their submission, it is considered a finality that cannot be retracted. If the same idea is to be pursued at a later stage, it is launched as a new proposal.\n\n<b>Living:</b> This is a special status designated to PIPs which are expected to undergo continued updates. Such proposals never reach a state of finality and remain in an editing loop for their whole lifecycle. An example of such a proposal is PIP-1.\n\n## How can builders contribute towards improving Push?\nThe Push ecosystem is addressing a gap in critical blockchain infrastructure by enabling native communication between protocols, dapps, and wallets. Push is live on Ethereum and Polygon to power real-time uncensorable connectivity for over 100 Web3 apps and service providers.\n\nDevelopers can contribute to the Push ecosystem in the capacity of their interest, which includes Push protocol implementations, such as changes in core, interface, networking, or application-level standards. Also, if you’re aligned towards the meta-PIP it opens up a contribution channel for procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Push development.\n\n![Small PIP](./image-2.webp)\n\n## Come contribute to grow the Push ecosystem!\nIf you’re interested to read more about PIPs, check out the [PIPs Github](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs) repository where you can find additional information, including:\n\n- [PIP template for submission](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/blob/main/pip-template.md)\n- [PIP forum](https://gov.push.org/c/pip/29)\n- [PIP-1 — Purpose and Guidelines](https://gov.push.org/c/pip/29)\n- [Definitions of Types, and categories of PIPs](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/tree/main/definitions)\n\nWe invite all members interested in contributing to the future of native communication in Web3 to check out the [Push Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) and [PIP forum](https://gov.push.org/c/pip/29) and come meet the pioneers behind Push.\n\nWho knows, you just might be the author of the next chapter of Push and native communication in Web3.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

As such, users of Boba Network can receive decentralized push notifications pertaining to asset bridging.\n\n## Boba Network: Ethereum Layer2 for the Masses\nBoba Network is touted to be the people’s layer-2 for Ethereum that prioritizes developers and users. At its core, it is an L2 Ethereum scaling and augmenting solution. It features extensible smart contracts that allow developers to build the next generation of DApps that invoke the web-scale infrastructure. Boba offers community-driven liquidity pools while facilitating fast exits and giving LPs incentivized yield farming opportunities.\n\nMoreover, the Boba Network allows faster transactions, hybrid computing, lower gas fees, and Ethereum-level security for users. Users can also seamlessly move digital assets, including NFTs from Ethereum L1 to L2. As such, this novel network can benefit from a decentralized communication channel that allows direct communication with its users to keep them updated about the various activities on the network. This is where the collaboration with Push Protocol comes into play.\n\n## What Does the Integration Entail?\nThrough our integration with Boba Network, we envision the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to directly interact with its users. This channel will be housed on the Push platform and users of Boba Network can subscribe to it to receive decentralized push notifications on their devices. They can expect to receive notifications whenever:\n\n- Their assets are bridged into the Boba Chain\n- Governance proposals are up for voting\n- The results of the voting are declared\n\nThis allows users to grab the governance and investment opportunities on Boba Network at the right time. Push has a Chrome extension, a dapp, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\n\nWe’re pleased to collaborate with Boba Network on their journey and Stay tuned for more announcements in the coming week!\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n## About Boba Network\nBoba is a “Multichain “ L2 Ethereum scaling & augmenting solution built by the Enya team as core contributors to the OMG Foundation. It leverages Optimistic roll-up technology and allows developers to build the next generation of DApps and DeFi protocols.\n\nStay in touch: [Website](https://boba.network/) and [docs](https://docs.boba.network/).\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

After our rebrand to Push Protocol many things followed up and it’s time we go over them.\n\n![What's New](./image-1.webp)\n\n## Development 🏗️\nThe fun in the development team never ends. As we mentioned last month, many initiatives were coming together and this month they made it live!\n\n### Push Protocol in Polygon Mainnet\nOctober started strong with our announcement of Push Protocol deployed in Polygon Mainnet to bring world-class communication infrastructure to the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nYou can [read more here](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1575485566065381377?s=20&t=TdVmvodS54VtGSPTMr-Ovw&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) in case you missed it!\n\n### Push Chat (Alpha)\nA wallet-to-wallet communication protocol! We started development activities some time ago and Push Chat made it Live at the Polygon Connect event in Bogota. <b>Wanna give it a try?</b> Ping us on Discord!<br/><br/>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-5wsuRIS3s\" title=\"PushChat Product Launch\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><br/>\n\n\nAnd it doesn’t end there. We are working to launch very soon the Push Chat SDK, which will enable hackers and development teams to implement wallet to wallet communication in your solutions!\n\nNow, there are many other things that the dev team have been working on this month:\n\n- The new browser extension of PUSH Protocol is now live on Staging & Prod. With this extension now consuming the new SDK for fetching notifications.\n- The Push Protocol dApp is made it live on Staging and Prod with enhanced UI/UX and better performance\n- Push Staging environment was migrated to Goerli Network 🙏🏽\n- CAIP implementation is in steady progress\n- The analytics Dashboard is coming together nicely. The team is working on also integrating Governance key points to make it more complete to everyone.\n- Our ever-green documentation was improved after all the great feedback provided by hackers during ETH Bogota.\n\nAnd last, but not least… Push Smart Contracts v2 is now in development. More news to come soon!\n\n<center><b>. . .</b></center>\n\n## The Push circle of Frens gets bigger 🤗\nAlways exciting to see more projects trusting their Web3 communication on Push Protocol!\n\nThis month we started with amazing news of many projects joining us to celebrate Push Protocol coming to Polygon.

Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.png)\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nIn the past couple of years, the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies and DeFi opened a multitude of new investment opportunities for people across the globe. When compared to traditional finance, these investment opportunities were not only easily accessible but also far more profitable. Yield farming on DEXs alone gave investors an average [APR of 20–50% with some even going as high as 250%](https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-yield-farms).\n\nHowever, there is a caveat here. These opportunities, though profitable, are highly risky. So, average investors looking for steady growth of income with minimum risks, are left out of the DeFi revolution. This is where financial products like index funds could make a huge difference. By bringing together a portfolio of top stocks or bonds in a market, index funds let users benefit from the growth of the market without risk exposure.\n\nAs such, Phuture Finance is a DeFi protocol that is bringing index funds to the DeFi realm to cater to every day, risk-averse investors. And we at Push are thrilled to announce our strategic partnership with Phuture Finance.\n\n## How Phuture Integrates Push\nAs a crypto index platform, Phuture is designed to simplify investments through themed index funds. For instance, with its product Phuture DeFi Index (PDI), the platform brings together top DeFi assets (by market cap) on Ethereum. This allows users to capitalize on the overall growth of DeFi while minimizing the risks that come with each of these products individually. Along with PDI, the platform plans to build a whole host of other indexes that let users capitalize on various DeFi trends.\n\nNow, on a platform like Phuture where users invest in a financial product, they regularly check for updates on their investment. But Phuture Finance through its partnership with Push aims to directly deliver these updates to users. This not only improves the user experience on the platform but also allows users to take the required action on time.\n\nTo receive these updates, users of Phuture can simply subscribe to its channel on the Push platform. By doing so, they receive notifications whenever:\n\n- An index they’ve invested in has been rebalanced\n- An index they’ve invested in does +x% in a week\nIn the near future, we expect to integrate more use cases, bringing updates on all events to the Phuture platform. The best part is that users can receive these notifications on any device of their choosing. And these decentralized push notifications allow users to stay on top of their investments at all times.\n\nAs Phuture works towards making DeFi more accessible with index funds, we’re enthralled to partner with them and hope to continue this alliance into the future.\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n### About Phuture Finance\n[Phuture](https://www.phuture.finance/) (PHTR) is a decentralized crypto index platform that simplifies investments through automated, themed index funds on Ethereum. Accessible by anyone with an internet connection, Phuture is perfect for investors looking to upgrade their crypto investment strategy. Founded in 2019, Phuture has raised USD 3.75 million from VCs, crypto funds, and investors such as the CEO of Bitcoin.com.\n\nFollow Phuture on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phuture_finance) and [subscribe to their announcements](http://phuture.finance/contact) to be the first to hear updates!\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion.

Users are disconnected when connecting to digital assets and worlds; Push Protocol aims to change that. With the current web3 experience, it is not practical to expect meaningful and valuable interactions without a robust communication method.\n\n## Recalling the Metaverse: A Participatory Digital Society\nThe metaverse is an ambiguous idea and does not necessarily have to depend on a blockchain to exist. However, metaverse-based projects that use blockchain as their underlying infrastructure lack a means for communication. This necessary component is needed to deliver the intended socio-economic potential of the metaverse.\n\nThe metaverse can be interpreted in many ways and analyzed through different disciplines. Still, in general, the metaverse attempts to redefine how we interact and transact with one another through a participatory digital society. The metaverse requires a novel communication method that allows us to become active participants in the said digital society.\n\nThe two key things we mentioned here:\n\n- The socio-economic potential of the metaverse requires a means of communication.\n- Communication within the metaverse allows us to become participants in a digital society.\n\n## Meta-communication in the Metaverse\nPush Protocol is ready for meta-communication. As a universal and chain-agnostic protocol, Push can be used as the communication mechanism to send messages and real-time updates about activity in the metaverse. Digital entities within the metaverse can cross-communicate with one another. Creators can benefit from the frictionless experience of Push by forming direct communication channels with their audiences. Users can schedule actions in the metaverse based on automatic updates fostered through Push. Becoming the native communication layer means that Push protocol taps into multiple platforms, implementing meta-communication across the metaverse and web3.\n\nA project that recently integrated Push into their metaverse tech stack was [Decentraland](https://medium.com/u/98348dd48afe?source=post_page-----7efbda6d9b80--------------------------------), a virtual destination for digital assets. Decentraland contains a DAO that drives the direction of the virtual land. Users can propose all sorts of additions and improvements through the DAO. For instance, a user may want to add an example of the Eiffel tower at a specific location on the virtual land. The challenge is that other users must constantly check the latest proposals and continuously engage with the platform to raise their opinion and vote. With Push Protocol, the DAO can trigger a notification that broadcasts to all subscribed users through a dedicated Decentraland DAO communication channel about the Eiffel tower proposal. The image below illustrates this scenario:\n\n![Decentraland](./image-1.webp)\n\nConsider another example, this time based on managing your digital assets. You’ve listed an NFT for trade in a metaverse marketplace and aren’t aware of the offers being made. Nor are you aware of the general market or anything beyond what you already know about your potential trade. With push notifications, the marketplace can send you a message each time certain activities occur on-chain, such as another user bidding on your NFT.\n\n## How Can We Push NFTs?\nMany of us have been to web3-based events and received an NFT for attending or participating. Imagine you have just attended a speculator workshop about one of your favorite crypto projects and received an NFT for being a participant. You’re excited to look back at the NFT the next time you open your wallet as a way to connect with your cool experience.\n\n## Engage with Users\nBut, it usually stops there. The NFT is lonely and picking up digital dust, staying static at your address. Imagine the NFTs could talk to each other. Based on specific data queries on addresses that hold NFTs as part of the same collection, users can push messages to each other’s wallets. NFTs can also notify users about how other NFTs are being used.\n\nAnd we can consider the other perspective with the NFT provider(s): wouldn’t it be great to have a method of communication to keep in touch with participants, community members, and contributors instead of closing the doors on each other after they’ve left your event? Your team just ran an excellent crypto event and managed to give out more than 200 NFTs to participants. While you’re stoked about the successful event you ran, you know that after the participants mint their NFTs, they will sit in their wallets, gathering dust, and the interactions between you and them likely won’t exist. The diagram below shows an example of how Push protocol can communicate with NFT holders and establish a connection as long as they’d like to subscribe.\n\n![Engage With Users](./image-2.webp)\n\n<i>The metaverse and the digital assets within the blockchain space have proclaimed a message without being able to message: we need decentralized communication middleware, and Push Protocol offers just that.</i><br/><br/>\n\nWhile we named a few use cases in this article that relate to the metaverse and NFTs, there are plenty more, and we encourage you to start building yourself!\n\n<i>By Danny Salman</i>\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

Powered by Push Protocol.<br/>\n\nToday, we’re excited to announce the next evolution in Push Protocol: Push Chat!\n\nPush Chat is a wallet-to-wallet communication protocol that will accelerate the growth and value of web3 applications and communities alike. We are launching the Push Chat alpha and opening up access to select users across the Push community. To learn how to get access to the alpha, see “Push Chat Alpha Access” below.\n\n## The TL;DR about Push Chat\nThe Push Chat alpha allows anyone with a wallet or an ENS to chat with others directly through the Push Chat application ([app.push.org](http://app.push.org/)). Text, GIFs, and images are supported in the alpha. With a couple of web3 steps added in, Push Chat operates just like a typical messaging application — just web3-native. Features to be added down the road include video, group chat, payments, transfers, live chat, and more.\n\nPolygon Wallet is a launch partner for Push Chat, setting the stage for the intra-wallet chat that allows users to stay entirely within their wallets to communicate instead of jumping in between applications.\n\n## Push Chat Alpha Access\nStarting today, October 10, access to the Push Chat alpha is available to the following individuals. (If you’re not part of these groups, don’t sweat! We’ll be rolling out more alpha access to the communities in the weeks to come, and the full public launch isn’t too far behind 🙂).\n\n- <b>ETH Bogota Hackers</b>. If you were a developer who hacked with Push Protocol during ETH Bogota this year, come try out the alpha! More information is in the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/pushprotocol\">Push Discord</a>.\n- <b>Alpha POAP Holders</b>. If you have a POAP from the Push team handed out in Bogota, you can access the alpha. <i>Come find the Push team at Devcon (Push has a booth on Day 3 & 4 of Devcon!) and other events in Bogota and ask for a POAP</i>.\n\nIf you are part of the Push Chat alpha, your feedback will be important to the success of the app when it goes public. [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) and leave your thoughts and feedback in the #push-chat-alpha channel.\n\nIf you don’t join the Push Chat alpha — no worries! The public app will be available soon — stay tuned.\n\n## From Notifications to Chat (and Beyond): The Push Journey\nIn 2020, we launched as Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) to bring to market a clear and valuable product: push notifications on Ethereum. Push notifications are a core component of the daily user experience in web2. Much of our daily interaction with apps, services, and one another is prompted with push notifications. Since launching on mainnet in early 2022, Push Protocol has powered over 18 million notifications across 100 channels to nearly 60k subscribers.\n\nThe next frontier, we knew, was another core component of the daily user experience in web2: messaging. Even more than push notifications, global peer-to-peer digital communication has become a cornerstone of our society. Our reliance on web2 chat applications, however, has a long history of privacy concerns, data exploitation, censorship, human rights concerns, and poor user experience.\n\nWe knew that messaging would eventually find its home in web3 not as a feature, but as a fundamental building block for decentralized infrastructure. We started working to bring the lessons and the success from building push notifications into the next primitive of blockchain applications: chat.\n\n## Push Protocol: A Rebrand for the Future\nBefore we could launch Push Chat, we had to deal with the fact that much of our market branding to date has focused on push notifications. Not just that, but push notifications on Ethereum. If we wished to move beyond push notifications to include chat, we also knew that chat would need to be available to any web3 user, no matter which blockchain their app operated on.\n\nSo, in September 2022, EPNS [announced its rebrand](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1574771582790406144) to Push Protocol! Push is the multi-chain communication platform of web3. It powers any type of communication on any decentralized network, helping to better connect apps, services, developers, and users. And our rebrand wasn’t just for kicks. Two days after the rebrand, we announced that Push Protocol was [live on Polygon’s mainnet](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1575485566065381377), capable of powering notifications for the thousands of apps and hundreds of thousands of active users.\n\nWith new branding that nods to our roots, we are <i>pushing forward the future of web3 with robust, decentralized, and user-friendly communication for all</i>.\n\n## The Vision for Push Chat\nCrypto has been on “single player mode.” By that, we mean that interaction has largely been single-direction. Apps communicate through monolithic communication methods. When communities do come together to talk to one another, they are forced to do so outside of the technology stack they are so passionate about.\n\nAnd yet…the crypto market has seen unparalleled growth, driven by the sheer devotion that users have to the technology and their willingness to put up with an imperfect user experience. What if we unlock “multiplayer” mode in web3, and enable all the players of today’s and tomorrow’s ecosystem to communicate with each other directly with the technology they’re building? The growth that will spark is parabolic.\n\nExpressive, “multi-player,” web3-native experiences have been missing. When we bring chat and communication into the web3 stack, we begin to unlock composability and capabilities that have been impossible today unless web2 chat platforms have elected to build web3-compatible features.\n\nThe opportunity of Push Chat for developers will be to build better communication systems embedded into users’ everyday applications. Chatbots to automate communication and customer support. DAO communications to members and amongst members; including governance discussions. Wallet developers in particular have blank space to start integrating communication directly into user wallets, unlocking an entirely new paradigm for the way in which we use our wallets on a daily basis.\n\nBut, we don’t believe chat is just a feature. It is a core piece of the infrastructure of the decentralized internet, enabling any person, service, or app to communicate with others without barriers or borders. Our vision is for Push Chat to power every form of communication that occurs on the new internet that is being built. It’s a lofty vision, but one we’re excited to build with our community.\n\n## Looking Ahead\nPush Chat is the next evolution in web3-native communication. Push Protocol has spent 2 years building the most widely-adopted push notification service in web3. With Push Chat, we are delivering on our promise to create the most useful, adopted, and user-friendly communication protocol for web3.

As expected, all the hackers delivered impressive [work](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1575838134251626496).\n\nNow, it’s [ETHBogotá](https://ethglobal.com/events/ethbogota/prizes#push-protocol) time! This Friday, we’re challenging you to surprise and inspire the community with your projects — at the largest web3 hackathon in LATAM’s history and pushing new boundaries in web3 communication!\n\n## Prizes and Ideas 💡\nWe’ll be awarding multiple prizes totaling $10k for the best and most creative use cases using Push:\n\n- 🥇1st Prize — $3,500\n- 🥈2nd Prize — $2,500\n- 🥉3rd Prize — $1,500\n- ✨Runner up x5 — $500 each\n\nSince Push mainnet went live earlier this year, we’ve seen builders from the web3 ecosystem, such as [ENS](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x983110309620D911731Ac0932219af06091b6744), [dYdX](https://medium.com/push-protocol/app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x23c6b8fB0557FD5e6696BceF3fD4855E0d7018C0), [EarniFi](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xeEECa1449a75c96d2B34722AE7eE64121be42111), [Oasis](http://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x12b3eE60Df8ea26D03b8035Ec90434a38A82C4C7), [Lens Protocol](http://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xef6426D522CfE5B7Ae5dB05623aB0Ef78023dBe0), and more, build a variety of creative and useful use cases with Push. For more inspiration, here’re some product requests and sample use cases to get your wheels turning:\n\n- 💰 DeFi: Provide transactional updates with push notifications.\n- 🏦 DAO: Increase voting turnout using notification alerts.\n- 🎨 NFT and GameFi: Enable direct communications between players and platforms with simple notifications.\n- 🔧 Tooling: Offer a smooth user journey with push notifications.\n\n## Getting Started 🚀\nWe know getting started with building a new project can involve a lot of boilerplate code. That’s why we’ve put together some simple steps you can follow and create a channel — as the first step for sending notifications via Push Protocol, and get everything up and running in no time.\n\n1. Go to http://staging.push.org and connect your wallet.\n2. Once Connected, go to the Developer > Create Channel.\n3. Fill in the Channel Name, Network, and Channel Website URL details.\n4. Approve the transaction for 50 DAI (note: 50 test DAI and some test ETH are required for channel creation).\n5. After that’s approved, approve the second transaction call.\n6. Congratulations — your channel has been successfully created, and you are all set to send or receive notifications.\n\n### Useful links:\n- [Use case](https://www.notion.so/pushprotocol/Push-Protocol-Use-Cases-c0fe5e17bc634502817bdc60c29221e3)\n- [Monorepo SDK](https://medium.com/push-protocol/here-comes-the-all-new-epns-sdk-monorepo-framework-8447b486a801)\n- [Developer docs](https://docs.push.org/)\n\n### Hackathon survival guide — if it’s your first hackathon:\n- Join ETHGlobal [Discord](https://ethglobal.com/discord) to find a team before the hackathon gets started, but it’s totally okay to hack alone.\n- Go through the [use cases](https://www.notion.so/pushprotocol/Push-Protocol-Use-Cases-c0fe5e17bc634502817bdc60c29221e3) to get some inspo.\n- Join workshops during the hackathon, i.e., <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_tJGwyJBclY\"><i>How to Add Web3 Notifications to Your Project</i></a>.\n- Clean and easy-to-read documentation to win (and wow) the judges.\n- Explain what problem you are solving and why your project matters to your users in a short and sweet demo video.\n- Find the Push crew if you need any help — from brainstorming to user testing to feedback — we will be there for you.\n- One $ tip: the more protocols you are integrating with your hack, the more $ you are more likely to get if you do win.\n\n## Let’s Push for Web3 Communication Together 🔔\n<b>A little fun fact:</b> We started building Push (EPNS) in 2020 at the ETHGlobal hackathon, and the feedback we got from the early hackathon community convinced us that it could be so much more. So please remember, you can get pretty far in just a 3-day hackathon, and ETHBogotá is exactly your opportunity to make something happen!\n\nThe Push crew will be around to answer questions and offer our support. If something is missing that you want access to — find our crew members on site or let us know [online](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol). And don’t hesitate to get in touch on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol).\n\nGood luck and have fun! We can’t wait to see what you build!\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n<!--customheaderpoint-->\n# Seven protocols have joined Push to bring better UX to the Polygon Ecosystem.<br/>\n\nPush Protocol has recently launched on Polygon with [Lens](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-and-lens-powering-ux-with-notifications-and-aaves-lens-85828638e691) being the official launch partner. Today, we are excited to announce, some old, and some new friends are combining forces with Push to grow and strengthen their presence in the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nIn today’s post, we are going to explore some of the use cases of these frens supported by Push.\n\n## Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Provides Transactional Updates with Push Notifications\nDeFi has proven itself to be a key pillar of web3 since the start of DeFi Summer. Every day, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people are executing transactions, buying & selling, borrowing & lending, yield farming, and doing all kinds of activities on various dapps. Even though there have been major developments and upgrades on the application level and the smart contract level, UX still remains one of the main friction points. Users need to keep themselves informed about the projects they are trading on via Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. If users forget to check updates for some time, god forbid their loan might be liquidated or their position might be closed out because of some unexpected events that happened when they weren’t checking.\n\nThis is where notifications come in handy and why Push is very proud to announce it is bringing the critical notification solution to DeFi dapps on Polygon. Use cases we have established with our partners, such as [QiDao](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x994909594Ef6c80cE8d9C85Ad30AeC696E10f73E) and [Mean Finance](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x2f5ccA6f594118ef54f4157927A323BaA982Fd78) are to remind their users when their loan or collateral is approaching liquidation and other key stats which are critical for users to take urgent actions upon. For educational and fun DeFi projects such as [GoodGhosting](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xe8381F84a32A4C2B08c328BfF68c0E889a34F255), Push is keeping its users updated on the latest pool and round start dates so users can participate in those pools on time to enjoy the full benefits. For those gamblers in web3 (aren’t we all), Push is alerting users of [Pool Together](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xdc0964aaacE97CF4E7476B4EEbC924730E524ade) on changes in the prize pool and if they win in any of the four governance-managed prize pools.\n\n## Governance Teams Increase Voting Turnout, Powered by Push\nGovernance is one of the most common use cases for Push notifications. DAOs and the governance team in web3 know the pain of having to constantly remind communities to vote on important issues all too well, only to be blamed afterward if some members did not see any notification in the first place and missed out. To use [MahaDAO](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x64A971F0D01b3555Ac60B9Bd151d5B7A75cf12Fd) as an example, MahaDAO is using push notifications to inform its community when a new governance proposal is made and is ready for voting, so the governance manager never has to worry about turnout again.\n\n## Push Notifications Help NFT and Gaming Projects Keep Players on the Hook\nMuch hope and excitement have been put into web3 gaming and NFT space. Despite the huge influx of funding flowing into the space, UX and the sophistication of gaming design are still very much a work in progress. Smooth onboarding of users, In-depth understanding of players and players’ community will help to accelerate the mass adoption of blockchain-based gaming. Push is working together with leading gaming teams such as [Polychain Monster](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x27F68B2C092DB48928D70EA781F7dE8B844ad07B) to enable direct communications between players and platforms. Players will receive notifications regarding their rewards, game updates, or airdrop of any rare NFTs, keeping them well-informed of the progress they’ve made in the game and players are more likely to stay.\n\n## Tooling Offers Smooth User Journey with Push\nWeb3 is eating up web2, starting with the metamorphosis of various web2 tooling. ETH Sign is a perfect example of evolving from an established web2 tech solution, taking it on-chain to facilitate immutable and verifiable document signing. With Push, [ETH Sign](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x77f319B1d9c43a8B729399f81515166632100744) is able to notify signees at each step of the signing process while making sure comments are seen and checked.\n\n## In the Web3 World, We Push Together\nWhile the use cases listed above provide a good first view of the extensive capabilities of Push notifications, it’s important to remember that new use cases are emerging every day. Using notifications to increase UX, product stickiness, and community engagement is a feat many developers strive for and this trend will continue to drive more demand toward notification services that offer the most smooth, customized, and reliable solutions that stand out in comparison to legacy alternatives.\n\nIf you are a developer and want to quickly get your application integrated with Push, don’t hesitate to get in touch on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) or reach us via our social media channels below.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

Our recent announcement of support for the Polygon network marks a new phase for Push and the world of multi-chain communication. We could not be more thrilled for the incredible team at Lens to be the first to integrate Push and power push notifications for their users.\n\n## Lens and Push: Communication for Web3 Social Media\nCensorship-resistant dapps are steadily replacing centralized social platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. Every day, we see an increased demand for social apps that allow content ownership and free speech.\n\n[Lens Protocol](https://lens.xyz/) is the building block of web3 social. It enables the development of decentralized social applications that can be used to create, own, and monetize their content without the risk of censorship. Launched in May 2022 by Aave Companies, Lens Protocol’s tech stack for building decentralized social apps is live on Polygon and is already powering over 100 decentralized social media dapps. Those include: [Lenster](https://lenster.xyz/), a decentralized Twitter; [Lenstube](https://lenstube.xyz/), a decentralized video-sharing, think TikTok and YouTube; [Refract](https://refract.withlens.app/), a decentralized link forum think [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and others. Since its mainnet launch, the Lens API has had almost [3 million](https://twitter.com/lensprotocol/status/1565062620310372353?s=21) transactions, and over 70 thousand Lens profiles have been created.\n\nIn the world of social media, apps use notifications to keep us connected to our friends, work, and more. Today, Push is happy to work with Lens Protocol to let you stay on top of what is most important to you in your digital life!\n\nWith this collaboration, Push will power web3 notifications in the Lens ecosystem and create the best and most user-centric social experience. In version 1 of the Push integration, Lens can enable notifications to be sent to Lens profiles to better ensure communication and engagement around an event occurring with their profile, such as comments. Users can [opt-in](http://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xef6426D522CfE5B7Ae5dB05623aB0Ef78023dBe0) to the channel now, and start receiving notifications soon.\n\n## Building the Best Web3 Experience Layer With Lens\nWe are excited to be working with the Lens team to build out the best web3 native “Experience Layer.” Among those possible notifications, we anticipate building customizable notifications (likes, follow, etc) for Lens profile holders in future versions of this integration. Users have the ability to opt-in and out of the types of notifications they would like to receive and create customized notifications on top of Push that are tailored towards their own needs.\n\n“The Aave Companies is excited to be at the forefront of innovation having Lens Protocol be the first integration on to the Push Protocol,” said <b>Stani Kulechov, Founder of Lens and CEO of the Aave Companies</b>. “Communication is crucial to social networking and bringing easy-to-use tools for engagement as well as allowing for further notification customization capabilities will make the Web3 experience on Polygon more accessible and user-friendly.”\n\nLens is quickly becoming the go-to solution for building web3 social media. By using Push, dapps building on top of Lens are able to target the right users, increase user retention, boost adoption, and increase dapp engagement. All these benefits also translate to better UX. Such a key piece of infrastructure has been lacking in web3, and Push is proud to solve that piece of the puzzle and help better the user experience for the crypto community.\n\n“While Lens allows users to create their own social graph and get complete control of their data, content, and community, Push Protocol provides a decentralized and chain-agnostic communication bridge for the entire web3 world,” said <b>Harsh Rajat, Founder of Push Protocol</b>.\n\nAave’s team built one of the leading DeFi dapps with over [$6.6 billion in TVL](https://defillama.com/protocol/aave). Now, the future of social media is here, and it is decentralized. We’re excited to grow with Lens Protocol innovating web3 social, and looking forward to working with Lens to innovate web3 social and improve the way that blockchain technology can serve society.\n\nIn web3 social media, we Push together.\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n### About Lens Protocol\nThe Lens Protocol is a Web3 social graph on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake blockchain designed to empower creators to own the links between themselves and their community, forming a fully composable, user-owned social graph.

Soon, Push Protocol will announce launch partners to allow users to begin subscribing to live channels, opting to receive notifications when certain on- or off-chain conditions are met.\n\n## Polygon & Push\nPolygon, previously Matic Network, is a suite of layer 2 protocols backed by an ecosystem of next-generation apps. Polygon has a range of products that aim to solve the underlying challenges with traditional blockchain architectures, all while improving the user experience for end-users to support the mass adoption of web3 products and services. Push Protocol’s launch on Polygon will address the lack of communication between apps and users to support the Polygon ecosystem in improving the web3 user experience.\n\nMore than 37,000 apps are built on Polygon, offering a tremendous opportunity to create custom communication channels and user-based messages that users, developers, and stakeholders will benefit from. As with other apps, developers can easily add a notification service to their Polygon-based app and enable app-to-wallet communication. Users on Polygon can use wallet-to-wallet communication for just about anything.\n\nLately, Polygon has become the go-to platform for web2-based institutions to onboard into web3, such as Meta, Adobe, Stripe, and Starbucks. The new dapps built by these institutions can benefit from the flexible communication offered by Push Protocol, which gives them the ability to have direct control over messages, all while preventing spam. Users expect applications in web3 to provide a similar standard of user experience as they do with the applications they currently use daily. Users interacting with apps on Polygon will have the same user experience they do today when on these platforms by using Push Protocol.\n\nSmart contracts on Polygon powered by Push Protocol can include notifications that can reach any wallet, app, mobile app, and plugin. Push’s mainnet launch was in January 2022. Since then, the protocol has powered 17 million notifications on over 100 channels to close to 60,000 subscribers, making it the largest decentralized communication platform in web3.\n\n<i>“Push Protocol represents a fundamental communication layer for web3 that is sorely missing. By unlocking instant, direct notifications within the Polygon ecosystem and beyond, Push evolves the services many of us take for granted — bringing us one step closer to a truly composable and decentralized web.”</i> said Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon.<br/><br/>\n\n<i>“Our launch on the Polygon mainnet, immediately following our rebrand from EPNS to Push Protocol, is a pivotal moment for our ecosystem. Communication is a critical component for the future of the internet, and Push is rapidly expanding beyond the Ethereum network and beyond push notifications by building the missing piece of web3,”</i> said Harsh Rajat, co-founder of Push Protocol.<br/><br/>\n\nThe recent rebrand from EPNS to Push signals two evolutions from the service: the move beyond Ethereum and the move beyond push notifications to all forms of communication. Today’s announcement about Polygon’s integration of Push Protocol is the service’s first move into multi-chain, with more announcements about networks and communication types on the horizon. Let’s push for web3 communication!\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n### About Polygon\n[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) is the leading blockchain development platform, offering scalable, affordable, secure, and sustainable blockchains for Web3.

The rebrand signifies the network’s move beyond Ethereum to other blockchains and beyond push notifications to all forms of communication. The existing channels, notifications, $PUSH token, and app all remain unchanged. Learn more at [push.org](http://www.push.org/).\n\nDear EPNS family,\n\nToday, we are announcing a significant milestone for the protocol and community: EPNS is rebranding to <b>Push Protocol!</b> The rebranding of EPNS will take effect today. All existing EPNS implementations will remain the same, but the rebranding marks the beginning of the next phase of decentralized communication in web3.\n\nThe groundwork for the rebrand from EPNS to Push Protocol was laid a long time ago. This next step marks the beginning of two fundamental evolutions in EPNS\n\n1. <b>Moving beyond Ethereum to other L1s and L2s</b>\n2. <b>Moving beyond push notifications to all forms of communication</b>\n\nPush Protocol will continue to evolve by enabling flexible and decentralized middleware that serves as a public good to solve the decentralized communication problem.\n\nA communication protocol must be able to adapt to changing environments, constantly meet user needs and communication methods, and facilitate easy upgrades to be considered future-proof. The web3 communication layer of today should not look the same in twenty years, as we will likely change how we communicate and notify each other. Push Protocol is ready for this.\n\n## What is (was) EPNS Anyway?\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is a push notification protocol for web3. It enables any dapp or user to send out notifications to an audience that has subscribed to a specific channel (anyone who sends a notification is considered a channel in EPNS). Since the mainnet launch in January 2022, EPNS has powered over 17 million notifications across 100 channels to nearly 60k subscribers.\n\nThere are two actors in the original EPNS architecture: <b>publisher</b> and <b>subscriber</b>. As a publisher, you can rely on a transparent, secure, decentralized network of nodes that facilitate peer-to-peer notifications to channels. The network includes an incentivization scheme that rewards those maintaining the network while ensuring notifications are delivered correctly and messages are untampered with. EPNS (now Push Protocol) can also send out messages automatically triggered based on certain on-chain events.\n\nAs a subscriber, you should control what channels you subscribe to and know what to expect. The service is user-centric and stands by a user-first philosophy: an easy opt-in mechanism to subscribe to notifications that meet user needs. Not to mention, the protocol scores all messages to protect against spamming.\n\n## What is Push Protocol? A Generalizable Communication Solution\nPush Protocol is the next evolution in communication, built on top of nearly a year of proven mainnet adoption by EPNS. Push Protocol retains all the push notification capability of EPNS, and also lays the groundwork for multi-chain, general-purpose communication.\n\nCommunication is everywhere, and Push Protocol can fill the communication gap to get information across the web. To truly meet the original vision of EPNS, that is, being a platform agnostic and flexible protocol, this is a crucial next step to scale the protocol and make it as compatible as possible with all types of technology stacks and solutions.\n\nPush Protocol is already integrated with dozens of dapps across the web3 space, each with their own approach to deliver wallet-to-wallet and wallet-to-dapp messaging. As Push is an open communication solution, the protocol will progress with contributors from all platforms.\n\n## The Future of Communication: Web3 UX starts with Messaging\nPush Protocol keeps web3 users and web3 developers engaged with each other, all in real-time. Whether you only use a wallet to manage a few assets, are an active community member for one of your favorite projects, or building a state-of-the-art dapp, you should be able to feel like you are part of a flourishing web3 ecosystem; being able to reach all platforms and not be subject to interact with the new web in isolation.\n\nWe are super excited to take on this journey with you and can’t wait for what the future holds!

Many on-chain governance systems have low voter turnout, which is a result of many things, one being poor user experience.\n\nWhat if you’re a core contributor to the DAO, trusted by the DAO to uphold specific responsibilities and keep the community informed? Updates to the DAO can be transmitted over a communication channel to tell community members about the latest updates and what to look out for directly on their accounts.\n\nWeb3 communities must start to limit their dependence on platforms like Discord for their communication and use [EPNS’ communication channels](https://app.epns.io/) to serve information to the community directly.\n\nAs a core contributor to a DAO, who the members trust to uphold specific responsibilities, you can keep members informed in real time. Some fallbacks can be implemented, as dapps can immediately notify users of potentially malicious behavior of a core contributor or representative of the DAO based on that individual’s on-chain events. Imagine how many incidents EPNS can prevent with a simple communication channel integration.\n\n## A Communication Layer Empowers Decentralized Creativity\nWe’ve heard it a few times — web3 needs push notifications; end users and developers need communication and a way to create awareness about important information: EPNS? We hope EPNS can serve as a public good for messaging, but a communication layer for web3 sparks more innovation and solves a significant user experience problem.\n\nA creator economy with poor user experience is unsustainable, and creators should not operate in isolation; they should be able to communicate with other creators and build an ecosystem where everyone can push important information directly to the creator’s interface.\n\nGovernance in web3 is not meant to operate on Discord, Telegram, Slack, or depend on social channels outside. In many ways, this seems counter-intuitive. Imagine if a project runs an ambassador program but only depends on Discord. The project can integrate EPNS and create program-specific channels for program members to push messages over, like an ambassador communication channel that allows ambassadors to curate communication efforts to end-users and other ambassadors. DAO updates can also benefit, as the EPNS communication layer addresses many coordination issues in generating awareness and supporting end-users.\n\n## What Happened Around Me Today?\nMost of us may be surprised to learn about the amount of new policies (including policy changes) introduced in our governance systems. Beyond news outlets (including journalist activities), the reality of governance systems in the real world is that there isn’t a standard or format for notifying the general public about changes directly from the information source unless citizens manually look for them.\n\nStill, governance workers (like politicians) may keep their constituents up-to-date with push notifications via email, SMS, or even social media channels, but this depends on the politician and the medium they choose for communication. The news tends to focus on significant changes, but the risk is that they could be censoring information and likely have a bias. We are establishing a piece of software that addresses these pitfalls.\n\nWhat happened in web3? Well, DeFi solutions across web3 continue to integrate with EPNS to alleviate the friction with their end-users and fill the communication gap. An example of this is \n[Bancor](https://medium.com/u/2bd55d9e5fb5?source=post_page-----1ea1e0a58ce1--------------------------------), which we mentioned in [Part 2.1](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/loan-update-high-utilization-or-low-liquidity-please-check-your-position-fe917fe7c193?postPublishedType=repub). DeFi proposals to the Bancor protocol can be game-changing, and users should have a mechanism to know about them!\n\n![Communication Channel](./image-1.webp)\n\nAnother earlier integration with EPNS was done by [MakerDAO](https://medium.com/u/743224aba00c?source=post_page-----1ea1e0a58ce1--------------------------------), which has an active governance process maintained by a set of smart contracts and a vibrant community. However, users need to constantly watch the MakerDAO governance portal or depend on social channels to know about new polls and the state of current ones. Imagine there were communication channels to send notifications about polling information directly to users.\n\n<i>With EPNS, MakerDAO generates awareness, encourages participation, and brings the community together.</i>\n\nFor example, if the DS-Chief contract in Maker elects a new rule across the protocol, users should know as soon as a rule takes effect. Suppose the rule is up for review and available to vote on. In that case, it only hurts the overall progression and strength of the protocol when users are unaware or need to check for changes, creating a constant overhead of missed updates.\n\n![EPNS Channels](./image-2.webp)\n\nWhile we named a few use cases in this article that relate to governance, there are plenty more, and we encourage you to start building yourself!\n\nStay up-to-date with EPNS through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/epnsproject), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/epns), [Forum](https://gov.epns.io/), [Docs](https://docs.epns.io/), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService).\n\nAnd stay tuned for the subsequent use case article on NFTs and the Metaverse!\n\n<i>By Danny Salman</i>\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

As such, users of Commonwealth are poised to receive decentralized push notifications pertaining to the governance process. These notifications increase user participation and keep users updated about every step in the governance lifecycle.\n\n## Commonwealth: On-chain Governance Simplified\nCommonwealth is all-in-one governance and community management protocol. On this platform, anyone can create a community, link their governance contracts, and manage their communities with ease. The core functionalities of Discourse, Snapshot, on-chain voting, synchronous chat tools, and network analytics are all available on one platform for users\n\nWhether it is community discussions, treasury management, crowdfunding, or decentralized governance, crypto projects can rely on one go-to platform, making the process easy and accessible.\n\nAs such, the platform can benefit from a communication medium that keeps users updated about all the steps in the governance and discussion processes, encouraging user participation. This is where EPNS plays a key role.\n\n## What Does the Collaboration Entail\nThrough our collaboration with Commonwealth, we envision the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to interact directly with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and users of Commonwealth can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications at every step of the governance process like whenever\n\n- New proposals are up for voting\n- The voting process is about to end\n- The results of the voting are declared\n\nThis allows users to grab the governance opportunities on Commonwealth at the right time. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a dapp, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\n\nWe’re pleased to collaborate with Commonwealth on their journey towards bringing communities together for on-chain events and hope to continue the alliance into the future.\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n### About Commonwealth\nCommonwealth is a governance and community management protocol. The protocol enables users to claim and govern their communities. Anyone can create a community, link their governance methodology, and discuss the future of their specific community.\n\nStay in touch!

In this post, we will focus on decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWhile there are trade-offs to be made, DeFi should not be a step back in financial processes or user experience. The web3 communication layer enables solutions to increase the DeFi experience significantly. Let’s take some time to consider some of the current pitfalls in DeFi.\n\nAll financial products come with a degree of uncertainty. In centralized finance, uncertainties exist around safety, security, privacy, data integrity, and trust. However, centralized financial products work well for what they are supposed to do, with the caveat that the financial service provider controls the product and its usage. These products usually have sufficient user experiences with appropriate measures to inform users about essential information.\n\nAn example:\n\nModern financial systems use server pushes to send different information based on account activity. For instance, if you conduct a transaction from a foreign IP address, your bank’s server may push a notification to you through one (or many) information channels you are subscribed to, informing you about the transaction as a security precaution.\n\n![Design](./image-1.png)\n\nBy design, decentralized financial products aim to alleviate many uncertainties in centralized finance; users can safely and securely participate in financial services without permission, control their financial data, and don’t have to trust a financial service provider. DeFi products and services are still yet to reach this optimal vision. Yet, even in a world of optimal DeFi applications, the current user experience is uninformative, limits authentic engagement, and is not practical for the average user.\n\nToday, DeFi applications and services come with a high degree of uncertainty. DeFi users shouldn’t have to manually check activity constantly or depend on individuals’ efforts to release updates and findings on social channels. As unfortunate as hacks and exploits are, there should also be time-sensitive alerts about suspicious or unusual DeFi events, especially with the emergent nature of DeFi. In general, using EPNS as a communication layer enables:\n\n- Wallet-to-wallet and wallet-to-dapp messaging: user-centric messaging, regardless of platform or device, to communicate about the activity that matters most. Users also shouldn’t experience the limitations of account-based communication that exist in the financial world today.\n- Real-time updates about a range of DeFi primitives, such as price volatility, liquidity supply, state of liquidity pools, LP positions, loan positions, and Epoch farming.\n\nAnd more.\n\nAn example:\n\nTake, for instance, a DeFi asset management tool that manages LP positions in liquidity pools across different dapps. The tool’s purpose is to provide and deploy dynamic LP strategies for various LP pools. The tool monitors specific statistics and transaction data to achieve this. Despite the tool’s helpful service in managing assets and minimizing risk, how does the user know:\n\n- which pool their liquidity is in without checking?\n- the state of the liquidity pools?\n- if the strategies of the tool change?\n- how to avoid a certain threshold of risk without constantly engaging with the tool?\n\nand so on.\n\nAdding EPNS as the messaging protocol to the DeFi asset management tool, wallets can opt-in notifications they find most valuable and cater those notifications to metrics they are most comfortable with, all in a gasless manner.\n\n![Structure](./image-2.png)\n\nDeFi solutions across web3 continue to integrate with EPNS to alleviate the friction with their end-users and fill the communication gap. An example of this is [Bancor](https://medium.com/u/2bd55d9e5fb5?source=post_page-----fe917fe7c193--------------------------------), a growing EVM-based AMM (automated market maker), recently integrated EPNS and has an EPNS- based communication channel where a variety of messages are pushed to Bancor users, such as updates on liquidity mining, fee changes, and new token listings, to name a few.\n\nPush services through push or alert nodes aren’t new, but a chain agnostic solution that is robust, modular, and interoperable is yet to be established. The web3 communication layer allows for universal notifications, no matter the use case or the platform. EPNS encourages universal messaging, so dapps and wallets can talk to each other and notify their users. Without effective communication in place between peers, the goal for mass DeFi adaption is far-fetched. We will continue to explore other use cases for EPNS in the coming articles, stay tuned!\n\n<i>By Danny Salman</i>\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

It is designed to power the next generation of DeFi, NFT, GameFi, and metaverse projects.\n\nThe high scalability, instantaneous transactions, and low gas fees are enabled by the novel nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus that evades wasteful mining. Reef Chain is EVM-compatible and allows developers to easily integrate their existing dapps and protocols without changing the base code.\n\nThis novel blockchain network also supports wrapped ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to transfer liquidity and take advantage of its speed, affordability, and efficiency. The chain is self-upgradable and completely evades the need for hard forks.\n\nAs such, this next-generation blockchain can benefit from a decentralized communication mechanism that allows the network to directly communicate with its users. And, we at EPNS are proud to announce our strategic collaboration with [Reef](https://medium.com/u/4f1649b3658b?source=post_page-----f5e80bb632ff--------------------------------).\n\n## How Reef Chain Integrates EPNS\nThis collaboration between EPNS and Reef Chain will allow the network to directly communicate and deliver platform updates to users through decentralized push notifications. These timely push notifications will allow users to take required action and grab various opportunities on the network with ease. It also reduces their dependency on centralized communication platforms and saves them the hassle of manually checking for updates. The best part is that users can receive these push notifications on any device of their choice.\n\nIn the first stage of this integration, users are poised to receive notifications whenever their assets are successfully bridged from the mainnet. Later on, we expect to deliver push notifications for various other activities on the chain including governance updates, and loan liquidation alerts.\n\nWe are enthralled by the possibilities of this association with Reef Chain and hope to continue the alliance into the future.\n\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\n\n### About Reef\nReef is an EVM-first blockchain designed to make Web3 accessible for the next billion users.

Middleware also provides services that are not present in the operating system. The push notification service provider is an example of this, known as an operating system push notification service (OSPNS). For instance, the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) lives on iPhone devices as an OSPNS middleware software.\n\n## Taking the Push Notification Provider Away From the Notifications\nWeb3 moves away from the traditional client-server model and alleviates today’s power concentration over the control and truth of information and data. Web3 attempts to take service providers away from services, where middleware becomes trustless software (but can still be trustful) that offers security guarantees and robust communication through decentralization. Web3 also attempts to reconfigure how we monetize things in society and redirect incentives to where they should go, users, participants, communities, and those generating value.\n\nAddressing the limitations of push technology while utilizing its features in the next iteration of the web requires an OSPNS-like piece of middleware. There needs to be a similar layer of abstraction and push technology primitives that allow notifications to create a web3-based OSPNS.\n\n## Enter Web3 Push Notifications\n[The Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)](https://epns.io/): a decentralized OSPNS for push notifications; the open communication layer for web3.\n\n![Project Stacks](./image-1.webp)\n\nEPNS addresses the user experience problem in web3 by providing push notifications for wallets and dapps. EPNS allows any dapp, smart contract, backend, protocol, or, in principle, any distributed technology to send communication directly to user wallet addresses in an open, feeless, and platform-agnostic way. Being an open and permissionless protocol, anyone can create dedicated channels to distribute information directly to user wallets without needing to rely on centralized service providers. The protocol serves many communication primitives beyond simple push notifications, such as peer-to-peer chatting, communication channel creation, and on-chain governance. In addition, EPNS addresses information and content censorship as the protocol allows users and applications to control the content they’d like to push.\n\nWeb3 users:\n\n- don’t need to trust or rely on a centralized OSPNS for information.\n- don’t need to interact with applications unnecessarily and manually stay on stand-by for any activities they would like.\n- can opt-in to information and alerts they find useful.\n- can communicate with other accounts instead of operating in isolation.\n- can automate messages that users and dapps care about.\n- can expect a much better onboarding experience.\n\nEPNS enables open and direct peer-to-peer communication through an incentivization scheme without compromising communication or anonymity. Instead of app-to-client messaging, EPNS allows for wallet-to-wallet or service-to-wallet messaging both for on and off-chain events. As a result, end users have end-to-end visibility of transactions and on-chain events to generate awareness while increasing trust.\n\nFor example:\n\nGovernance mechanisms in web3 often lack good user experience as users must constantly check on and off-chain activity for recent updates and proposals. Or, users depend on the news efforts from individuals on the latest governance activity.\n\nIf, for instance, a user wants to keep informed and engaged with Uniswap’s governance proposals, they have the overhead of constant engagement to not miss out on any activity.\n\n<i>With EPNS, that changes.</i><br/><br/>\n\nIntegrating EPNS with Uniswap allows users to receive notifications directly to their wallets whenever a new governance proposal is submitted, such as the recent governance proposal to [create the Uniswap Foundation](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/24?chain=mainnet), allowing users to stay up-to-date and never miss a vote.\n\n![Project](./image-2.webp)\n\nThis is what EPNS had the pleasure of doing in early 2021 — integrating with Uniswap to accelerate DeFi and the web3 experience. Learn more about the collaboration in [this blog post](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/accelerating-defi-with-epns-f2cbfaa33c91).\n\nThe information required to notify users about different web3 events is complex and requires massive infrastructure efforts, which is another reason EPNS started. EPNS is also a demonstration of how to scale services and implement solutions in a modular way, as developers can easily build dapps with EPNS. Before diving into the communication layer itself, including how communication channels and messaging work with EPNS, how the publish/subscribe model fits into web3, and understanding EPNS under the hood, we will attempt to make the case by using web3 push notifications for different use cases and the need for a web3 communication layer in Part 2.\n\n<i>By Danny Salman</i>\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

      "content": "![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image.webp)\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n<!--customheaderpoint-->\n# An Introduction to Push Notification: Part 1.1<br/>\n\nIt is hard to imagine modern mobile devices without push notifications. The first push service was launched by Apple in June 2009, the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs). After that, Google followed with a service of their own, Google Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM). Both companies have led efforts to enhance the push notification technology to where it is today.\n\nPush notifications are a type of message that can be presented in an alert-based format, such as message alerts, pop-ups, and banners. They serve as a mechanism that informs users about all kinds of information. Today, push notifications have dynamic traits with app components directly built into the notification delivery scheme.\n\nBefore the implementation of push notifications, different methods were used to send messages to apps, like maintaining a permanent open TCP/IP connection to a web server to receive real-time notifications (isn’t efficient and not practical for modern devices) and polling, which requires a real-time request to prompt a notification (polling follows the request/response model).\n\n## An Overview of Push Notifications\nMessages allow for the transferability of information over the internet and are integral to communication among networks. In traditional client-server models, there are two types of messages: requests and responses. Push notifications are a type of response message from the server side, known as a server push. The server push requires a network request and is often event-driven, as in, if event “n” happens, trigger a response that pushes message “m” to the client.\n\nThe majority of applications provide responses to the user based on the actions they take on the application. For instance, if a user tries to log into a social media account but enters the wrong credentials, the server may prompt a message “ser, wrong password, account locked forever.” A notification example that shows asynchronous messaging is a user who has a sports app on their device and receives real-time game updates about professional sports games being played simultaneously.\n\n![Notification](./image-1.webp)\n\n### An example with Discord\nTake the case of using Discord to keep up with all of your favorite crypto projects. Assuming you have allowed for notifications (1,2) if someone from the [EPNS Discord](https://discord.gg/YVPB99F9W5) server sends a message to a channel (3), the Discord server informs the push server of the availability of the new message (4). The server uses a unique ID associated with your device to push the new message as a notification (5). The push mechanism is not used when the Discord app is open on your device, as messages are sent directly from Discord’s server to your account. The way your device receives the notification in real-time is by retaining a single connection (like a WLAN connection) whenever you close Discord. This method is used as opposed to each app on your device having its own connection. Note: this is a simplified version of how notifications [can] work on Discord.\n\n![Architecture](./image-2.webp)\n\nTo receive server pushes, a client must first subscribe to information channels provided by the server. This requires permission on the client side. When subscribed to push notifications, a publisher can push information. This is known as the publish/subscriber model. In general, the publish/subscribe mechanism includes peers who congregate around a topic they are interested in which lives on a central server, and these peers are said to be subscribed to that topic. Whenever new content is available on one of the information channels, the server pushes that information out to the client. Typically, push notifications are pushed to a client app that a user is using from an application server. Server pushes work because of a continuously open connection between a client device or interface, and the push service. A server provided by the operating system developer acts as middleware between the service and the client device by curating the communication with the device. The device registers on the push server with a unique ID to send the right messages to the right device. Thus, push technology can be considered a type of communication protocol with a centralized service provider.\n\n## Push Notification Providers\nPush notification providers allow apps to send notifications to their users. This is where APNs and C2DM would fall under. As an app publisher, the app can easily send messages, and these messages take different forms. A push notification provider gives you a platform on which you can create, schedule, and deliver messages to users and allow apps to compose, target, and execute message campaigns. Today, push notifications are not only a way to provide information, but have become a standard for communication.\n\n## Using Push Notifications\nBeyond the examples we gave, push notifications have a ton of use cases and can certainly enhance application experience, engagement, and general communication. The obvious is that users can obtain information in real-time about [almost] anything. In general, apps can establish direct communication channels that operate in an asynchronous format, engage users with curated content, and drive application traffic, all while ensuring users are up-to-date and informed of future events/changes.\n\nOutside of messaging notifications, push notifications are often unfavorable based on their usage for marketing and advertising. The frequency of notifications is also challenging to figure out. In addition, knowledge resources and assets are completely controlled by service providers who have the ability to generate narratives; they are the source of truth for the messages that are pushed.\n\n## Next-generation Push Notifications\nHow do we take push technology to the next level? By taking the service away from the service provider; from client/server to peers. Peers can facilitate messages as they wish. There is more data integrity within the resources that are pushed to peers as the peers are able to control the data.\n\nMany networks are already building the next generation of the internet, aka web3. However, the user experience in web3 is still mediocre and lacks the characteristics of seamless interactions and communication as found in the current web model. Along with many yet-to-be components, there is a critical piece missing: notifications. Users using web3 applications are forced to manually keep up-to-date with everything they are interacting with, manually conduct activities on their account, and operate in isolation. Bringing push notifications to web3 not only addresses some of the current pitfalls of push notifications but fundamentally improves the web3 user experience to a level capable of bringing on mass adoption.\n\nIn the coming articles, we’ll explore how push notifications fit in web3 and dive into the key concepts mentioned earlier.\n\n<i>By Danny Salman</i>\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

We gave away sponsorships of <b>$5,000</b> and gave away <b>eight</b> prizes!\n\nHere’s a glimpse of some of the exceptional teams that built with us at [ETHAmsterdam](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1518558686498594816), [HackMoney 2022](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1530157366229860353), and [ETHNewYork](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1541466249825091584).\n\nAnd here, we are, working with ETHGlobal again for the [ETHOnline 2022](https://online.ethglobal.com/) hackathon to encourage all types of builders, hackers, and creators to participate and build the future of web3 communication with EPNS.\n\nSo let us give you guys a quick breakdown to help you BUIDL at the ETHOnline 2022 Hackathon!\n\n### 🔔 About Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)\nIf you are unfamiliar with what we do, [EPNS](https://epns.io/) is a decentralized communication protocol for web3. Any dapps, smart contracts, backends, or protocols can send comm (starting with on-chain / off-chain / gasless notifications) tied to the user wallet in an open, gasless, multichain, and platform agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet or front end to tap into the network and get the comm across.\n\n### 🔗 Important Reference links for Developers\n- [ETHOnline 2022 — Checklist](https://www.notion.so/epns/ETHOnline-Hackathon-Doc-List-cd9d0fc69f0d4e4691c60c772b03d48a) <br />\nIf you are new to EPNS, don’t worry!

Continue reading to learn how.\n\nBefore this proposal, the official PIP’s approval process was a 3-step process as follows:\n\n<b>Proposal Phase</b> — Here, the draft proposal is posted at https://gov.epns.io/. At this stage, the proposal must receive at least 5 likes and be on the forum for at least 5 days.\n\n<b>Discussion Phase</b> — The PIP number is assigned at this stage, and more community discussion is encouraged. The PIP must receive at least 10 likes and 3 comments and be in this category for at least 5 days.\n\n<b>Voting Phase</b> — The proposal is voted on and passed or rejected. In this final stage, the PIP will be up for voting for 7 days.\n\nA PIP takes at least 17 days to pass through this method. And while effective, it might not be efficient enough in some cases where a proposal might receive immediate positive traction from the community.\n\nNow that <b>PIP-08 </b>is approved, the process can be significantly expedited once a proposal meets certain criteria, reducing its time for the approval to 5 days.\n\n## Here is how a PIP gets passed at full tilt via fast-tracking:\nStep 1: Post the draft proposal in the Governance Proposals section of the forum.\n\nStep 2: The proposal must receive a minimum of 7 likes and 5 comments in favor <b>in the first 48hrs of being added to the forum</b>.\n\nStep 3: The proposal will be assigned a PIP number in the discussion forum and be promoted to Snapshot, skipping the discussion phase.\n\nStep 4: Promote to Snapshot with immediate vote open for 3 days.\n\n### Important considerations to fast-track your proposals\n1. Fast-track requires a quorum (i.e., 1% of total votes ~ 153k PUSH as of August 17, 2022 )\n2. Proposals that don’t meet the criteria on any steps will continue the standard flow.\n3. For the comments on the proposal to be considered, they must be made by users with at least a <b>Basic</b> trust level (Level 1). The questions asked by users with<b> Member</b> trust level (Level 2) and above must be answered to continue with the Fast-track process. More information on trust levels can be found [here](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/).\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

While some offer the utmost decentralization, others are carved out for scalability, and then some are exclusively meant to support NFTs. The <b>growing number of blockchains</b> and their categorization isn’t particularly a bad thing.\n\nHowever, blockchains, by design, cannot communicate with or read data from sources outside their own ecosystem. This results in many high-potential but segregated blockchain ecosystems, each having its own isolated set of applications, platforms, and users.\n\nAs a solution, we have projects working to address the lack of interoperability to help apps and users transfer data and value across different chains. One project that is leading the charge in interoperability is Socket. And we are thrilled to announce that EPNS is partnering with this innovative project to bring a decentralized push notification service to its users.\n\n## Where Does EPNS Fit Into Socket’s Equation?\nSocket enables blockchain interoperability through its two key components:\n\n1. The Socket Liquidity Layer acts as a DEX aggregator and ensures users can easily transfer funds across blockchains as per their speed, fee, and security preferences.\n\n2. Socket Data Layer is a messaging layer that smart contracts and, thus, dapps hosted across blockchains can seamlessly interact and share data with each other.\n\nWith these two components, Socket offers developers the base infrastructure to build dapps that can operate across multiple chains. This also translates to the fact that users of the dapps using Socket’s infra would be able to easily transfer value across chains. And this is where EPNS comes into the picture.\n\n<b>Socket will use EPNS to notify its dapp users whenever bridging between two chains is complete</b>. Further, users will have the option to get notified whenever the gas fees drop so they can execute their cross-chain transactions for the lowest possible fee.\n\nIt is a delight for us to be partnering with projects like Socket that are genuinely pushing the bars higher for interoperability standards. While we have kicked off this collaboration with two use cases, we are excited to explore more use cases as the platform develops and new possibilities come into the picture.\n\nStay tuned to keep updated on the most recent EPNS partnerships and developments around the decentralized push notification standards!\n\n### About Socket\n[Socket](https://socket.tech/) is an interoperability protocol for secure & efficient data and asset transfers across chains. Socket is not a bridge or a cross-chain app — it is an infrastructure that allows developers to build these things easily. Developers can use Socket to build apps with interoperability as a core part of app infrastructure.\n\n[Website](http://socket.tech/) | [Bungee](http://bungee.exchange/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SocketDotTech) | [Discord](https://t.co/Il4enrA7Lo)\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

Mariano, Juan David, and CryptoChica joined us to discuss about everything ETH Latam, and the challenges and opportunities for the Latam region.\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\n    01:30 — 04.40 | Welcome! <br />\n    04:40 — 14:00| Mariano talks about his travels, living in Argentina, whats coming for ETH Latam, and his opinion on the upcoming Ethereum merge.<br />\n    14:00 — 17:50| Juan David talks about his participation in organizing DevCon Bogota and other initiatives.<br />\n    17:50 — 30:30 | All three guests discuss about the challenges & opportunities for the Latam region.<br />\n    30:30 — 35:50| Technical parenthesis to talk about the Uncle Maker problem: (Time)Stamping Out The Competition in Ethereum<br />\n    36:00 — 46:00 | CryptoChica talks about her journey in the web3 space, and the Quadratic Funding initiative for projects aligned to Public Goods in Argentina.<br />\n    46:30 — 1:02:48| All guests talk about what to expect when they come to Argentina and Latin America in general. Focus on meeting people and creating relationships.\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\nWe were set for a very entertaining conversation from the get-go after all guests started joining and words started to flow in English and Spanish. The Latam Fam was in the house!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LLiH-yDlqDY\" title=\"Friday #PUSH Call 21 – Vamos LATAM Fam 🧉💃 ft. Mariano Conti, Crypto Chica, and Juan David\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\nMariano was first to speak, and shared with everyone a little bit of what has been his life over the past year with all the travels he’s done and all the people he have met 🗺️. We discussed why Argentina became a hub for innovation due to all challenges people face on a daily basis. And we got the Alpha as to what he will be talking about during his talk in ETH Latam (<b><i>don’t miss it!</i></b>), and his “toy project” that as per Harsh “will change the world in the future!”.\n\nWe couldn’t miss the opportunity to get Mariano’s opinion on one of the most anticipated events in crypto — the <b>Ethereum Merge.</b> Looking forward for this moment to come!\n\nNext in line — <b>Juan David</b> from the Colombia community 🇨🇴 brought the latino style into the conversation and decided to spanglish things up! He shared with the things he’s been up to for the past year and his participation in organizing DevCon Bogota.\n\nWith the ETH Latam communities reunited in this space, the conversation took an interesting shift into discussing the challenges & opportunities for the Latam region and the role Ethereum and the blockchain technologies play.\n\nAnd in the blink of an eye we came to our last guest of the Latam Fam CryptoChica 🇦🇷. Given her vast contributions in creating educational content for the Spanish speaking community, we wanted to know “Who is <b>CryptoChica</b> and what has been her journey in the web3 space? — “Saludos a DeFi Latam”\n\nWe talked about the Quadratic Funding initiative that just started for projects aligned with Public Goods in Argentina, and soon to start in other countries.\n\nTo finalize, all our guests took a minute to talk about what everyone can expect when you come to Argentina and the ETH Latam event 🎉.\n\nIt was definitely a very fun time with friends and the Latam Fam in the house, we can’t wait to see you all in the Argentina.\n\nTill next Friday Push!\n\n— The EPNS team\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

This second half of the year is looking to be loaded with many new features and so many great news.\n\nLet’s do our thing and recap briefly all the happenings during July.\n\n## Development 🏗️\nThis month the Development team have made tons of progress in all fronts. Preparing backend tooling for monitoring, working on the PUSH Nodes, improvements to our dApp & SDKs, and of course one of out most awaited features — Wallet to Wallet communication.\n\n- The <b>Analytics Dashboard</b> have been in development to provide services with insights about notifications and their channels. The entire backend Integration is done, and the Dashboard will be released very soon.\n- With <b>PUSH Nodes</b> being a central piece in the EPNS ecosystem, optimization together with the standardization of payloads plays a critical role to ensure its optimal functionality. As we start making it publicly available anyone will be able to submit an improvement proposals for it.\n- On the decentralizing of PUSH Nnodes side, we are segregating nodes into modules. So, participants can spin up their own node and provide the service to the network to send notifications\n- The <b>EPNS Smart Contract v1.5 Audit</b> is coming to its last stage. Many new features will come together as we deploy this new version of the smart contracts. More details will be provided soon!\n- Content markdown standards for frontend SDK are in the works.\n- <b>Wallet to Wallet</b> code reviews are done. Currently going over extensive testing and also working with design team to provide a great UI ready for launch.\n- <b>EPNS dApp UI/UX improvements</b> for a better experience for channel creators and users. Also working on getting the sending notifications ready for multi-chain support.\n\nWith so many development efforts happening concurrently, there is so much room for conversation and discussion. We encourage everyone to join us on our Discord to participate and brainstorm ideas. We highly appreciate our community involvement to ensure every release is rock solid.\n\n\n## Frens of EPNS 🎎\nNo month recap would be complete without briefly mentioning the Frens we made this month, and what we are building together with them:\n\n- [Pine Protocol](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1542553551901278211?s=20&t=GXkfWyIHO3c6E6AObcN6ag): with their platform providing permissionless instant loan transactions that evade the need for negotiations, providing also loan liquidation and expiration alerts helps users be on top of their operations at all times.\n- [Sturdy](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1544728385733070854?s=20&t=ig7MxT6oSokwEmRJit6vSw): bringing timely notifications to users when their assets are in risk, but also notifying them about high APY opportunities available on the platform.\n- [Quest3](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1546543616570433537?s=20&t=bjnec1ShgYxUwKg9uy5oQQ&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email): providing users with opportunities at their fingertips and keeping them informed when a new quest starts or is about to end.\n- [Wonderverse](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1546902851976175616?s=20&t=5PBQj1Yka209QE2QTi620w): implementing into their Project Management offering notifications to users when anew task is assigned, or if the due dates for a task are approaching/reached.\n- [Polychain Monsters](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1550163713013186560?s=20&t=XZHLvLfunThtEKeKS5naPA): this collaboration aims to to notify users about important events such as when rewards are sent, and even if you pulled a rare Polymon.\n- [Cryptocurrency Jobs](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1552701299942367232?s=20&t=cd-LeFcxmiN7NQnZd9slqw): nothing beats getting new job opportunities delivered directly to you in a timely fashion so you are the first to act on it.

Followed by the user and developer journey for the folks who’d be interested in building over EPNS.\n\n### A tête-à-tête with our good ol’ fren Sam of Journal Du Coin\nOne of the best things about EthCC was learning so many interesting things happening across Web3, meeting some really exciting people especially French developers and folks who’re building on top of EPNS. And that’s exactly what Harsh resonated in his interaction with the one and only the top French media personality in the blockchain space, Sam, of Journal Du Coin.\n\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1551607830204932096&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"696\" width=\"680\" title=\"EPNS | $PUSH on Twitter: &quot;&quot;During my entire journey, I met some awesome French developers backing the web3 vision!

He was joined by some really focused, and awesome Web3 founders and builders, such as Hongbo, Founder of Debank, Fabian Riewe, Founder of KYVE, Hadrien Charlanes, Founder of Sismo, Marijo Radman, Cofounder of Solity Network\n\n### Meeting some Frens Old & New\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.png)\n\nAnd last but not least, what’s the future of France without meeting a ton of frens from the web3 space, old and new!\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

This technology made it possible for a network of participants from different parts of the world to collaborate and run the blockchain network on their terms. All without the need for centralized authorities.\n\nHowever, the degree of decentralization of blockchain-based protocols is determined not just by their architecture but also by the way in which they are governed and operated. In this regard, DXdao is DeFi’s super scalable collective that personifies decentralization. With an innovative suite of products, this protocol aims to provide decentralized governance solutions for DeFi protocols to help scale the DeFi industry as a whole. On this ambitious journey, we at EPNS are pleased to collaborate with DXdao to enable push notifications for Swapr Campaign updates and uphold the spirit of decentralization.\n\n### How DXdao Can Benefit From Push Notifications\nAs its name suggests, DXdao is a decentralized autonomous organization that is owned and operated by its community of users. It builds solutions for the development, growth, and governance of DeFi products, with a special emphasis on governance. It has an illustrious list of products that provide services ranging from automated market making and predictions to token launching and programmable incentives.\n\nDeFi protocols can integrate these products into their own platforms to create super scalable platforms. And, through one of its star products Swapr, DXdao provides a multi-chain AMM with a suite of unique features including LP governance, DIY farming, and much more. However, without the help of a reliable communication channel, it is difficult to keep users up to date with all events and news to maximize their participation in Swapr. This is where DXdao’s integration of EPNS could be game-changing.\n\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\nThrough our collaboration with DXdao, we aim to build a robust communication channel through which the network can keep its participants updated about all Swapr campaign events. Users can subscribe to the official channel on EPNS to receive notifications whenever\n\n- A campaign in Swapr is expired\n- A new campaign is starting\n\nAs DXdao continues to revolutionize and fully decentralize the DeFi ecosystem, we are pleased to collaborate with them to ensure the greatest user experience for all participants. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of DXdao.\n\n### About DXdao\nDXdao is a decentralized collective that builds and governs DeFi products. DXdao was spawned in May 2019 through a collaboration between Gnosis and DAOstack. Reputation (REP) is voting power in DXdao, and DXD is the financial token with a claim on profit from DXdao products. Some of DXdao’s products include [Omen](https://omen.eth.limo/) (permissionless prediction markets), [Swapr](https://swapr.eth.limo/) (governance-enabled AMM), [Carrot](https://carrot.eth.limo/) (programmable incentives), [Mesa](https://mesa.eth.limo/) (batch auction DEX), DXvote (DAO governance). DXdao believes in governance and decentralization.\n\nConnect with us: [Discord](http://discord.gg/4QXEJQkvHH), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dxdao_), [Telegram](https://t.me/dxDAO), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/dx_dao), [DAOtalk Forum](https://daotalk.org/c/daos/dx-dao/15)\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

Half of 2022 is done!\n\nCan’t believe it’s been more than six months since our Mainnet launch!\n\nAnd not to mention that we’ve got some of the best collaborations in the Web3 space packed with some amazing feature upgrades to help build a truly decentralized communication layer across Web3!\n\nAt EPNS, we believe in the ‘build at speed’ philosophy and at the same time, support fellow builders in the community to help build and grow the ecosystem. To ensure that, as you might know, we had approved Grants for some amazing projects via our [Push Grants Program](https://gov.epns.io/c/grants/10).\n\nTo top it all, what could be better than getting amazing participation from builders all around the World at ETH NewYork!\n\n## Highlights for the latest Q2 — 2022\n- Starting with channels, the total number of live channels on EPNS has reached 74, a 45% increase from the previous quarter.\n- Also, we witnessed ~16% growth in unique users and opt-ins across the platform.\n- We have delivered over 11 million+ notifications to date, a 175% increase from 4 million notifications that were delivered till Q1 2022.\n\nThese were some sneak peeks of what happened in Q2 at EPNS, let’s dive into details of how we achieved these numbers 🦈\n\n## Development\nOur awesome team of builders has been hustling with the latest developments. And these updates are successfully echoing the EPNS mission of building <b>decentralized communications</b>.\n\nTake a look at the latest <b>Development Updates for Q2!</b>\n\n## Smart Contract V2 Development and Audit\nSmart Contracts V1.5 has now been developed completely. While we are working towards V2 of the contract, we decided to roll it out after V1.5 is launched. Some of the important features of EPNS Core V1.5 are:\n\n<b>Use of $PUSH token for Channel Creation:</b> EPNS Core Contract shall no longer require DAI tokens for channel creation. Instead, developers can now create Channels with a minimum deposit of 50 $PUSH tokens.\n\n<b>Claim Reward Function:</b> V1.5 of the EPNS Core Contract will include a function that allows $PUSH Holders to claim rewards from the contract.\n\n<b>Time-Bound Channels:</b> Special Channels that can be created for a specific time duration and will be destroyed upon expiry.\n\nSmart Contract V1.5 has already qualified for the initial security audit phase. After the final audit report, V1.5 of the EPNS contracts would be deployed on the <b>Ethereum Mainnet</b> and Testnets like <b>Kovan</b> and <b>Ropsten.</b>\n\nA separate blog to provide detailed updates on V1.5 will be published soon.\n\n### Editing Channel Details Feature\nThis feature on the Frontend dapp allows Channels to edit or modify essential details like Logo, Description, and Channel Name. Once Smart Contract V1.5 is deployed on the Mainnet, this feature will be made live on Prod.\n\n## EPNS x The Graph Integration\nEver since launching, The Graph has been one of the key supporters of EPNS. To foster this relationship and our shared values of decentralization, we have announced EPNS Integration with Subgraphs hosted on The Graph Protocol.\n\nTo enable this, we have created special tooling for a Helper Function that allows you to <b>read events across the Subgraph</b> and generate <b>Notifications</b> accordingly. If you are a developer and want to:\n\n- Track volumes of NFT collections on <b>LooksRare</b>, or\n- Access the data related to swaps and pairs on <b>Sushiswap</b>, or\n- Get notified whenever a sale happens on <b>CryptoPunks</b>\n\nYou can accomplish all these and a lot more with the latest Subgraph integration. Here is an [example guide](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/examples/notification-via-subgraph-example) on sending notifications from Subgraphs.\n\n## Polygon Deployment\nWe have already deployed the EPNS Communicator contract on Polygon Mumbai Testnet as well as Mainnet. Imperative features like sending notifications on Polygon have now been developed, tested, and deployed in the Staging environment.\n\nThe UI/UX for the entire channel creation flow, specifically for Polygon, is currently under development and will soon be live on Prod.\n\n## Wallet to Wallet Chat\nWe initiated the building of our Wallet-to-Wallet Protocol: a cross-chain communication protocol that allows wallets to exchange messages between them.\n\nWe also started building the UI for the Chat App, which will interact with W2W Protocol. Our Push nodes have been extended to support this amazing new functionality.\n\n## Analytics Dashboard\nFrontend and majority of the APIs for analytics dashboard are ready. Backend for the dashboard is also progressing at a rapid speed. We will roll out the dashboard as soon as the APIs are live.\n\n## Some More Updates\nThere are some other equally significant tasks that we worked upon in this quarter.\n\nOur devs extensively worked on standardization of the channel and notification payloads. The architecture for <b>Decentralized Push Nodes</b> is progressing at a rapid speed as well. <b>Browser notifications</b> are live on Dev and Staging environments.\n\nAlso, added the <b>Notification Preview</b> feature into the Frontend dApp. We are working on a<b> Mono Repo for Developers</b>, which is in its final stages. Besides, the <b>Ledger integration</b> with EPNS will go live in Q3.\n\n<b>Channel notifications</b> settings and <b>advanced search</b> are underway and will be deployed once the crucial updates for Smart Contract goes live.\n\n### Collaborations\nWe are building for the community, and bridging the communication gap between Web3 services and users is our mission.

Drop us a line through any of [our channels](https://linktr.ee/Epnsproject), and we’ll get in touch with you.\n\n### Governance\nWe have come a long way since launching our Governance portal back in Q1. Once again, we witnessed healthy participation from the community. We approved a bunch of Improvements and Grants proposals which we believe will be useful to the entire Web3 ecosystem and EPNS.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-2.webp)\n\nSpecial shoutout to mentor.eth for bringing a great proposal for hobbyist developers! ✨\n\nBelow you can find a list of all the key proposals that <b>were passed by EPNS Governance!</b>\n\n- EPNS has [onboarded Jump Crypto as a $PUSH liquidity provider](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth/proposal/0xe7b4ac3c09f15322044e3b8086fa03d5453086506a436bd94b31b36c660762e0) across exchanges to benefit our token holders and traders’ community\n- The second [proposal for Push Grants was approved for Social3](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth/proposal/0xf5f2f52577e400b3535dec40a2f2d0abc1f721d0a3e5e68765164d66f128097f), an awesome team building the social hiring platform for Web3\n- We [supported Chainwhiz with our Push Grants Program](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth/proposal/0x622750a94dcd2a486664ad2ef5c00e788fc75bac4315a995bb7e54f4fd598308) in building a <b>Bounty Marketplace on Polygon</b>\n- Thanks to [this proposal by mentor.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth/proposal/0x1fd82313d4356e5d7963c60649f0376e995cf326ff348269293026e6064e1f38), EPNS will reimburse gas fees charged for the channel creation upon the Developer’s request\n- The [Improvement Proposal to reduce Quorum](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth/proposal/0x7ea992d02c29f19de6f95d9889e6643de52d0ffb0421ded86b52b47129998120) to 1% has been successfully passed by EPNS Governance\n- Other Push Grants: [Tollan Worlds](https://gov.epns.io/t/tollan-worlds-x-epns-communication-layer-for-accessible-2d-pixel-metaverse/653) & [Codemire](https://gov.epns.io/t/codemire-epns-notifications-on-cross-ip-pvp-gamefi-ecosystem/648). <b>Both are very interesting projects in the gaming & metaverse space.</b>\n\n<b>Bonus Tip:</b> The latest version of <a href='https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth/proposal/0xbcb6c064e7610e18350c71a22a173468ded48e88fc66684fdc605dc47c748802'>Rockstars of EPNS is live</a> for weekly voting. Participants stand a chance to win cool EPNS NFTs with $PUSH tokens. We also have some special token-gated channels for our Rockstars 😉 Meet you there soon frens 👋🏼\n\n## Hackathons\nHackathons are an efficient way to bring BUIDLers together and fuel innovation. It also helps us receive genuine product feedback, as well as create brand exposure.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-3.webp)\n\nIn the last three months, we have sponsored four major global hackathons at ETH Amsterdam, HackMoney’22, Graph Hack, and ETH New York, and supported 150+ hackers and builders. These events were some awe-inspiring moments where we met amazing teams building with EPNS. Across all these events, over 50 projects integrated EPNS for a combined prize pool worth $16,000.\n\nApart from supporting the builders across multiple ecosystems, we also hosted an in-house HackSprint. It was a 2-Day virtual workshop for developers to Learn and Integrate EPNS into their dApps.\n\n### Featured\nApart from achieving a majority of the roadmap goals, our team proudly represented EPNS on the Global stage at numerous events. And to reiterate our narrative of why Web3 communication matters, our co-founder Harsh Rajat delivered a special talk at Schelling Point.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0drbcBMUUU\" title=\"Why Web3 Communication Matters - Harsh Rajat at Schelling Point 2022\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nNot to mention the brilliant workshops hosted in Amsterdam, Graph Hack, and NYC. Here is one such workshop at ETH Amsterdam where Fabio Costa explains [building Web3 communications with EPNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoIaB_lGayY). Must take a look at them if you missed out.\n\nWe are excited about all the cool stuff that’s going to come in the upcoming quarter. Keep supporting EPNS Protocol on our social media & discord server. And above all, keep building Web3 Communications 💜\n\nLet’s keep <b>PUSH</b>ing! 💪🏼\n\n<b>Remember:</b> The EPNS Team members will never DM you first, we never ask you to send money, crypto, private key, or any such thing. Stay safe out there, frens!\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

As such, Polychain Monsters will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their various activities in the rapidly expanding “Polyverse”.\n\n## Polychain Monsters: The Cross-Chain Collectible Ecosystem\nPolychain Monsters is an NFT project that aims to build a cross-chain digital collectible and gaming experience. At the very core of this project are Polymon, intricately designed and animated NFTs which can be unpacked in digital booster packs using $PMON tokens. These booster packs are available on the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon networks, in addition to a one-off 10k Solana drop featuring Polychain Monsters’ latest expansion — Exomon. Each booster pack includes three Polymon, which come in a variety of traits that define their rarity. Some combinations of traits are extremely rare and valuable, and have sold on secondaries for over $100,000.\n\nPolymon holders can earn weekly rewards by staking their NFTs or participating in yield farming using $PMON tokens. These Polymon will eventually play a crucial part in multiple play-and-earn games that are currently being developed within the Polychain ecosystem. As such, this project can significantly benefit from a decentralized communication channel that updates its users every time a new booster pack is available or when their rewards are deployed. This is where the alliance with EPNS comes into play.\n\n## What Does the Collaboration Entail?\nThe main aim of our collaboration with Polychain Monsters is the creation of a decentralized communication channel that enables direct communication between users and the platform. This channel will be housed on EPNS and users of Polychain Monsters can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications whenever:\n\n- Their rewards are sent\n- They pulled a rare Polymon\n- Other incoming features to be revealed\nThis saves users from manually checking for updates, making the platform easy to use. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\n\nWe’re excited to strike this alliance with Polychain Monsters and hope to become an integral part of their operations.\n\n### About Polychain Monsters\nPolychain Monsters are beautifully animated cross-chain NFTs with varying scarcity, waiting to be discovered in digital booster packs. These NFTs will play an integral part in upcoming off- and on-chain games. In addition, Polychain Monsters offers DeFi features such as ERC-20 & BEP-20 PMON, as well as NFT staking.\n\nStay in touch!

We were accompanied by Jacob from ETH Global, and some of the teams that decided to implement EPNS during the ETHNewYork hackathon last month.\n\n<blockquote><i>\nThis Friday PUSH was held on July 8th, 2022 at 2PM UTC\n\n2:00:00 — 2:06:00 | Welcome!\n\n2:06:00 — 2:19:30 | Jacob from ETH Global sharing about ETHNewYork\n\n2:19:30 — 2: 29:00 | Harsh talks about the EPNS Journey and ETH BCN\n\n2:29:00 — 2:35:00 | Common Grants\n\n2:35:00 — 2:40:20 | Linum Labs\n\n2:40:20 — 2:46:30| Keyko\n\n2:46:30 — 2:50:00| Granted\n\n2:50:00 — 2:54:00| Splytto\n\n2:54:00 — 3:00:20 | He(Art)\n</i></blockquote>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0-xoQutqwU\" title=\"Friday PUSH Call 19 - #MeetTheBUIDLers | @ETHGlobal\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<ImageText>PUSH CALL #19 Video/Audio — #MeetTheBUIDLers (of ETHNewYork 2022)</ImageText>\n\nWe started with Jacob going over everything that entails coordinating these hackathons, and how the organization runs their ceremonies after each event finishes to ensure the next one its even better — <i>“plan a lot, iterate a ton, and if you do this for a long time you’ll end up with an amazing team passionate for building excellent events”.</i>\n\nFunny stories that happen in hackathons to the teams and to the organization were also shared. Including the unknown story of a team called The Crypto Maniacs that built a now super popular DEX aggregator and chose the name of the project solely to be listed first in alphabetically in the projects list 😅. (check our [twitter spaces recording](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1dRKZlNEAmXJB) if you want to know which project we are talking about!)\n\nAfter sharing all these cool stories and whats to come for ETH Global, Harsh took the opportunity to briefly go over the journey for EPNS as a project born in ETH Global’s Hack Money 2020 and all the great things that comes when you participate in a Hackathon. It’s the people you meet, the advise you get, and all the support that comes after to get your ideas to the next level 🙏🏼\n\nBefore starting our conversation with the ETHNewYork BUIDLers, we took a few minutes to share the experience of the EPNS team in ETH Barcelona, and all the networking we were able to do there.\n\nNow it was time to <b>Meet the BUIDLers!</b>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1541466249825091584&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"825\" width=\"680\" title=\"EPNS | $PUSH on Twitter: &quot;And the #ETHNewYork Hackathon was a blast!💥So many incredible ideas, hackers &amp; submissions for EPNS at @ETHNewYork hackathon.

Kate was with us to share how Granted aims to help builders getting into action faster and providing accountability to both sides.\n\n- <b>Splytto:</b> Srilakshmi took the time to describe in detail their real-life use case that applies to every IRL event with friends — Expense splitting — and how they created a dApp for teams to split shares and settle it amongst themselves.\n\n- <b>He(Art):</b> We had Maia & Sunny explaining us how their gamified DAO governed collective can enable artists and users to take part in the creation and funding of public social good projects.\n\nWorking together with these amazing teams and people during ETHNewYork was a wonderful experience. We look forward to continuing seeing your projects grow and our collaboration getting stronger in time.\n\nTill next Friday Push!\n\nThe EPNS Team 💪\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

As such, Wonderverse will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their tasks and other activities.\n\n### Bringing Project Management to Web3\nBusinesses, no matter how small or big, deal with a myriad of tasks, projects, and plans. The smooth running of all these operations requires collaboration among all the people involved in the business. This is precisely why project management tools rose to fame in the last decade. They allow businesses to collaborate on project planning, resource allocation, and performance monitoring. The tools also provide the ability to establish a pyramid of tasks for effective completion.\n\nHowever, the popular project management tools of today are centralized and more suited for web2 projects. The decentralized web3 community that is now swarming with innovative projects, needs a decentralized project management tool and Wonderverse fills this gap. It is a web3 project management platform that allows DAOs to manage and track their workflows. From allocating tasks to managing resources and people, Wonderverse is a one-stop-shop for all things DAO management.\n\nThe past part is that it integrates crypto into project management, allowing users to pay and get paid in cryptocurrencies. With Wonderverse, web3 projects can do away with web2 project management tools and get the full web3 experience. In this regard, Wonderverse needs a communication medium that coordinates interactions between users and the platform. This is where the collaboration with EPNS is crucial.\n\n## What Does the Collaboration Entail\nThe main aim of our collaboration with Wonderverse is the creation of a decentralized communication channel that enables direct communication between users and the platform. This channel will be housed on EPNS and users of Wonderverse can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications whenever\n\n- A new task is assigned\n- Due dates for a task are approaching/reached\nThis saves users from manually checking for updates, making the platform easy to use. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a DAPP, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\n\nWe’re excited to strike this collaboration with Wonderverse and hope to become an integral part of their operations.\n\n\n## About Wonderverse\nWonderverse is a DAO native tool that combines critical pieces to manage participation in a DAO. Primarily a project management tool integrated into crypto, it strives to be a one-stop-shop for all things DAO participation.\n\nStay in touch!

As a result, users of the platform are poised to receive push notifications about various happenings. These notifications will allow users to grab opportunities on the platform and encourage participation.\n\n### Quest3: Web3’s Event and Quest Platform\nWhether it is on YouTube, Twitter, or Instagram, users of web2 are bombarded with advertisements everywhere with no tangible rewards for viewing them. User data is exploited and used to serve personalized ads to people with all the financial rewards going only to the businesses. Now, Quest3 is a web3 platform that aims to solve this problem and ensures that users are rewarded for their time.\n\nAdvertisements on this platform are presented in a gamified manner. Users receive advertisements while actively completing quests and earning rewards. The rewards include crypto tokens and NFT badges that hold real monetary value. This way of serving advertisements to users is beneficial for both businesses and users, allowing all players to benefit from the ordeal.\n\nIn this regard, Quest3 needs a communication channel that allows the platform to directly send notifications whenever new quests are available. This is where the collaboration with EPNS comes into play.\n\n### What does the Collaboration entail\nAs a result of the pilot collaboration between EPNS and Quest3, Quest3 will have an official channel on the EPNS platform that its users can subscribe to. In doing so, they will receive decentralized push notifications directly from the platform informing them about various happenings on the platform. Users can expect to receive notifications whenever\n\n- A new quest starts\n- A quest is about to end (in X days)\n- A quest ends\nThis allows the users to take full advantage of the opportunities as and when they arise. EPNS has a chrome extension along with a mobile application and a decentralized application to ensure that users don’t miss out on important notifications.\n\nAs Quest3 is working towards an open web infrastructure, we at EPNS are pleased to partner with them and hope to become an integral part of their operations.\n\n\n### About Quest3\nQuest3 is a Web3 quest and event platform incubated by [Hogwarts Labs](https://twitter.com/HogwartsLabs). Users can earn tokens and NFT badges by participating in quests and events. Quest3 is committed to providing a variety of permissionless on-chain and off-chain quests for GameFi, DAOs, communities and other projects, benefiting users continuously, flourishing the propagation ecosystem and realizing Web3 native value delivery.\n\nStay in touch!

To receive a specific notification a user has to set up a channel by which they can send notifications. A full guide on setting up channels can be found [here](https://docs.epns.io/users/hello-world-channel/sending-notifications). More information on EPNS DAPP can be seen [here](https://app.epns.io/#/live_walkthrough).\n\nThe community had recently voted on and passed<b> PIP-06: Reimburse channel-creation gas fees in $PUSH on developer request</b>. The results were immensely in favor of the proposal with 1.6M votes FOR and 2.6K votes AGAINST.\n\nYou can now request reimbursement of 80% of your gas fee within 24 hours of the channel creation, and your Gas fee will be reimbursed into your wallet in the form of $PUSH tokens. This removes an obstruction for underfunded or hobbyist developers from opening a notification channel.\n\nThe process to redeem your gas fees are:\n\n- Dev creates a channel\n- Announces the channel creation on the EPNS discord (use of multiple emojis preferred 😊 )\n- Let the world know of your channel and tag EPNS on all of your socials when you post(preferably Twitter).\n- Dev shares relevant details in this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNQ2_mACRQgyIPsr47woE69_FOds8aLIGupT20QIEUMfgnQw/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nThe EPNS team will review the form and send devs $PUSH relative to the market price.

As such, Sturdy will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their loans and high-yielding opportunities on the platform.\n\n### Bringing Interest-Free Lending to DeFi\nDeFi’s lending and borrowing protocols played a pivotal role in the industry’s rise, bringing millions into the decentralized realm. However, in the present scenario, borrowers are required to pay heavy interests for their loans along with over-collateralizing for the same. In this regard, Sturdy is the one of the kind of DeFi protocol that facilitates interest free borrowing for users.\n\nThe protocol utilizes the borrowers’ collateralized assets in a smart way by staking them with protocols like Yearn, Convex, and Lido. Then, the interest generated by these assets is used to pay interest to the lenders. This means that while borrowers can take advantage of interest-free loans, lenders can still make high yields and profits by lending on Sturdy.\n\nWith a truly novel approach to lending and borrowing, Sturdy is poised to bring in a new wave of users into DeFi. As such, the protocol can benefit from a decentralized communication channel that allows seamless interaction with its users. This is where the collaboration with EPNS comes into play.\n\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\nThe collaboration between EPNS and Sturdy aims to create a direct communication channel between the users and the protocol for seamless interaction. This channel is housed on the EPNS platform where users of Sturdy can easily subscribe to it. Subscribers will receive decentralized push notifications from the platform whenever\n\n- Their loans approach liquidation\n- There are high APY opportunities available on the platform\nThis allows users to take prompt action and grab the opportunities on time. Moreover, these notifications also save users from the hassle of manually checking for all these updates and improves the user experience on the platform along with the participation rates. EPNS has a chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application to ensure users never miss out on these notifications.\n\nWe at EPNS are excited to dive into this alliance with Sturdy and hope to contribute to the growth of the platform.\n\n### About Sturdy\nSturdy is a first of its kind of DeFi lending protocol offering interest-free borrowing and high yield lending. Users can interact with the protocol in two ways: as ‘borrowers’ who take out loans and provide collateral or as ‘lenders’ who earn yield on their assets.\n\nBorrowers pay no interest, withdrawal fees, or deposit fees. Instead, their collateral is staked, and the yield from their staked collateral is used to provide interest to lenders.

As such, Pine will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their loans on the platform.\n\n### NFT Backed Lending\nPine is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol in DeFi that allows users to borrow funds against their NFTs. Now, the NFT industry is one of the fastest-growing and most valuable in the world, with a market value of more than $40 billion. In the beginning, digital artists sold individual pieces of art as NFTs. And now, it’s a field with thousands of projects that could change the way the world’s biggest industries work. With an increase in utility, the net value of this asset class has increased exponentially with some NFTs going in the millions.\n\nAs such, NFT investments make for good collateral and Pine aims to bring this convenience to investors. The platform provides permissionless, instant loan transactions that evade the need for negotiations. The NFTs are valuated in real-time to ensure that both the borrower and the lender get a fair deal on the loan. Once the NFT is locked as collateral, borrowers can receive the loan amount in a cryptocurrency of their choice, even if it is different from the NFTs native chain.\n\nIn this regard, Pine can benefit from a decentralized communication medium that keeps users updated about the status of their loans.\n\n\n### What Does the Alliance Entail\nAs a result of our pilot collaboration with the platform, Pine will have an official channel on the EPNS platform. Users who choose to subscribe to this channel, are directly connected for seamless communication with the platform in a decentralized manner. They can expect to receive notifications like\n\n- Loan Liquidation alerts\n- Loan about to expire alerts\nThese notifications save users time and efforts of manually checking for loan updates and helps them take the right action on time. With a chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application, EPNS ensures that notifications are delivered to all devices and are not missed.\n\nAs Pine continues to revolutionize the DeFi lending space, we are pleased to collaborate with them to ensure the smooth running of their processes. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of the Pine Protocol.\n\n### About Pine\n\nPine Protocol is a lending and borrowing protocol built on multiple blockchains to facilitate on-chain asset-backed financing. As a two-sided protocol, Pine allows borrowers to use their assets, represented on-chain via NFTs, as collaterals to borrow cryptocurrencies from lenders in real-time, in a fair, transparent, and efficient way. Pine is built by a team of NFT lovers who come from diverse backgrounds in blockchain engineering, investment banking, and management consulting.\n\nStay in touch!

Dive into the details and buckle up!\n\nA year ago, we announced the [first volume](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf) of Push (prev EPNS) #ROCKSTARS on the heels of our IDOs. Each week for the following 52 weeks, we asked our community to participate in a small challenge. Meme competitions, explainers, tutorials, guides, threads, and more. You name it — the community came together and created it. Each week, the winner of that competition was gifted 2,400 PUSH and one Rockstar NFT, each of which was designed by an Indian artist.\n\n#### Today, we’re excited to kick off the second volume of Push Rockstars!\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.webp)\n<ImageText>Contribute to WIN 900 PUSH & an NFT</ImageText>\n\nFollowing the drop rules of [Rockstars of Push (prev EPNS) Volume 1](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf), We’ll be distributing one NFT a week (every Monday for the next 100 weeks 😱) to one community member who does something to help us push the envelope forward.\n\nSo what are some ideas for you to get Volume 2 drops? Well, in no particular order, here are some things community members have done for us in the past which we love 💖\n\n- Development blogs, workshops, explanations or any #buidl related things, the more creative it gets, the better\n- Provided PRs for improvements on several of our SDKs / Frontend / Repos: https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service\n- Written a blog post explaining an element of the protocol or token design very clearly 🤓\n- Created some killer memes about Push Protocol & push notifications for web3 💪\n- Or do anything which you have a knack for whether it’s getting people to build with Push, explanations, content, design, tweet threads, or whatever\n\n\n\n### Rules for Participation?\nThe best way is to follow Push Protocol on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol) and join [Discord](https://discord.gg/YVPB99F9W5) to stay up to date when we announce each weekly competition. Every entry that tags [@pushprotocol](https://twitter.com/PushProtocol) and uses #Rockstars will be considered. Being active on Discord and gathering community love will play a role in nominations though winners (as always) will be decided through governance. Top-notch entries (even in earlier weeks) will be eligible in rolling weeks and sometimes the Push team will try to spruce things up sometimes with some cool creative weekly contests so do keep an eye out on our Twitter handle!\n\nRock on and join the Push community! 🔔🧑‍🤝‍🧑\n\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

One of the coolest cities in the world! The city of diversity and dynamism!\n\nAnd of course having to meet some of the most amazing, coolest and rockstar BUIDlers of Web3!\n\nAs you join us from <b>June 24th-26th for ETHNewYork</b> alongside developers and creatives from the globe, we’re teaming up with ETHGlobal to build an awesome Web3 hackathon experience IRL, and hope you have an amazing experience!\n\nAnd to help you out with this Hackathon, we thought we’d quickly set up a blog to help you build on top of EPNS protocol for our amazing prize pool and then some..\n\n### About Ethereum Push Notification Service\nEPNS is a decentralized communication protocol for Web3! Using which any dApps, smart contracts, backends or protocols can send comm (starting with on chain / off chain / gasless notifs) tied to user wallet in an open, gasless, multichain and platform agnostic fashion. Open comm layer allows any crypto wallet / frontend to tap into the network and get the comm across.\n\n### Prize Overview — For ETHNewYork Hackathon\n- 1st PRIZE — $ 2000 USDC\n- 2nd PRIZE — $1500 USDC\n- 3rd PRIZE — $ 500 USDC\n- Runner Ups x 5 — $100\n\nBut that’s not just it! Over and above this we have an exciting grants program for you as well!\n\n### Push Grants Program approved for $1 Million!\nThis you’ll also be able to partake in and it’s running all the way up until the second quarter of this year! You’ll be able to find more details of this in our blog [here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-grants-program-going-live-6841515f95d8)!\n\n### 🔗 Important Reference links for Developers\n- [EPNS Documentation Hub](https://docs.epns.io/)\n- [EPNS Discord](https://discord.gg/n4EYGyPJcF)\n\nAlso, while you’re at the venue, come to our table & grab our Cheat Sheet! Will come in handy! And we’d get to meet you too irl… 🤝😊\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.jpeg)\n<ImageText>Cheat Sheet for Devs and Hackers</ImageText>\n\n### TL;DR — Quick Demo Video to get you started\nWhile you read through the blog for references, links and all the useful tips to BUIDL with us, if you prefer to, we have made a Workshop Video for you to view directly, which would also be provided to you by the ETHGlobal team and will show up on their channels.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cD5PSb97K5c\" title=\"EPNS 🛠 Building Web3 Communication in your DeFi App\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Ideas to Buidl. Solve. Conquer.\nFor those who’d prefer to go the reading way here’s how you can Buidl. Solve. Conquer this weekend!\n\nAs the blockchain ecosystem has evolved into a composable, multi-chain network, native Web3 communication is growing more and more necessary for user experience, developer operations, investor security, protocol architecture, and a lot more.\n\nToday’s methods of communication between and among Web3 users and companies — dominated by Twitter, Discord, and Telegram — give rise to poor UX, scams, and sub optimal communication. Among some of the most pressing issues: smart contract version releases are missed, liquidation thresholds are not warned, NFT drops are forgotten, and vulnerabilities aren’t communicated well.\n\nThe result is a fractured and siloed approach towards communication in the blockchain ecosystem, making room for an optimised, Web3-native solution. EPNS is created to fix this! This is how:\n\nIntegrate EPNS to your dApp and improve UX for all Web3 users\n\n- This is probably the easiest, As EPNS is a communication layer, the best and quickest way to get this going is to integrate EPNS in your dApp via our frontend sdk & tutorial here\n- This will not only improve the user experience for your dApp as users can now instantly see all their notifications across all their activities that they have opted in for but it also vastly improves the entire UX of the Web3 space.\n\n<b><i>Screen1- User is connected to their wallet and has loaded their dApp.</i></b>\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-2.png)\n\n<b><i>Screen2 — User sees the EPNS notifications if they are subscribed to any channels in a sidebar which comes on the click on the bell icon.</i></b>\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-3.png)\n<b>Create your dApp / protocol channel and send notifs</b>\n\n- So, you already integrated EPNS but like to also improve the experience for your users. Well, this is where you can jump in and create your own channel (any service that sends notifications are called channels).\n- After which you can easily start sending important notifications about your project directly to the wallet address in a gasless way.\n- Whether you are creating DAO, DeFi, NFT, Metaverse or anything in between, having a direct form of communication tied to user’s wallet address massively improves the experience of your dApp (and goes extremely well with the bell icon you have integrated)\n\n<b>Check out our <a href='https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-tooling/showrunners-framework'>Showrunners</a> and <a href='https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/examples/showrunners-example'>Tutorials</a> here for more details</b>\n\n<b>Create notifications channel for anything Web3</b>\n\n- A lot of projects and protocols are popular but still don’t have notifications, you can build notifications for them, not only you get prizes for it but some amazing incentives are coming for the channels that are popular (though this is a different conversation). Some ideas that you can use if you want to build out a notif channel.\n\n<b>Web3Comm for DeFi</b>\n\nThe DeFi ecosystem is a landscape of constant innovation. We have seen an unprecedented amount of on-chain activity, prompting acute needs from users to keep on top of what is happening. EPNS is poised to accelerate the adoption of the DeFi ecosystem to meet the needs of users and dapps to keep up with rapid innovation.\n\nThis of course is one while most important we’ve made quite a headway with a bunch of partners, however if you think you are able to renovate some of this, and build your own technology and have protocols that change the DeFi space for the better, we’d definitely invite you to explore this side of things. Some of the things that EPNS can enable for DeFI protocols and their users is to solve critical DeFi problems as below..\n\n- Near Liquidation Alert (Borrowers & Liquidators)\n- Staking Rewards Available to Claim (Stakers)\n- Staking Rewards About to Expire (Stakers)\n- Price Alerts (Traders)\n- Stablecoin Peg Slippage (Arbitrageurs)\n- Low Gas Cost (Devs, ETH Power Users)\n- Rebalances (Token Set Users)\n- Index Selection/Weighting Changes (Index Users)\n- Token/Contract Migrations (Protocol Users)\n- Governance Updates, Token Launches\n- New Collateral Types on Money Markets\n- New Liquidity Mining Incentives\n- Yield Farming APY alerts\n- Escrow Periods Ending / Tokens Coming Unlocked\n\nBesides these there are a ton of other applications that’ll most Web3 users in terms of getting communication or help on notification for that are of important notifications across the board.\n\nHope these ideas are some that you find exciting to build, and if you do have any queries feel free to reach out to us on Twitter @epnsproject\n\n### ☎️ Who do we reach out to for assistance?\nFeel free to reach out to us at <b>ETHNewYork</b>, our Co-Founder Richa and the EPNS team will be at the venue till the end of the hackathon. And of course on the <b>#sponsor-epns</b> channel on <b>ETHGlobal Discord</b>\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-4.jpeg)\n\n- [Fabio](http://twitter.com/learn4life6), Our Senior Developer Lead [Balkage#7666 on Discord]\n- [Richa](http://twitter.com/riijo/), Our Co-Founder [Richa | EPNS#321]1\n- [Jaf](http://twitter.com/jafetsc), Integration Lead [Jaf | EPNS#7611 on Discord]\n\n### 🎁EPNS Merch up for grabs!\nWhile of course we’ll get to know you when we meet up, interact with you guys, and will have some snacks for y’all awesome teams during the hackathon, we also got some goodies as giveaways for you to take back home as memories. So feel free to drop by at our table and grab some of our awesome merch!\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-5.webp)\n\n### Throwback: ETHAmsterdam Hackathon\nAs you get cracking on BUIDLing with us we thought we’ll sign off with some memorable moments from our last hackathon at [ETHAmsterdam](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1518558686498594816) and you’d know, when we go all out with our hackathons, we go all out!\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-6.jpeg)\nAll the best! 👍🤞👍🍀\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3.

The garden is open... https://t.co/bhzgxs9JFt pic.twitter.com/m2IqtIfb7P / Twitter&quot;\" class=\"ek n fc dx bg\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n\nAs we see the advent of NFT marketplaces like Soundxyz, OurZora, Coinbase NFT including social features to make the experience similar to that of scrolling a social media site with personalised recommendations, Instagram and Twitter starting to support NFTs, Lens protocol launching a decentralized framework for building social media applications that utilises NFTs for pfps and much more, it is evident that social media and NFTs (even NFT marketplaces) will soon go hand in hand, each one building off the other, building a more cohesive creator economy.\n\nThe unprecedented growth of NFTs (and hence NFT Marketplaces like Opensea) has led to an influx in new users in web3 in the past year. Although, with increased demand and users, comes the need for better user experiences and communication between protocols and its users.\n\n### A Need for a Better Solution for Web3 Communication\nThe current state of web3 social media and NFT marketplaces are reliant on web2 based centralized platforms in order to communicate with their users. This usually means one would need to dox their email, or any other personal handle in order to stay connected and updated about the state of their profile. One needs to reveal more than their wallet address in order to receive updates on the platform, or else they need to actively login to the platform in order to receive updates. In a world where users are accustomed to having information right at their fingertips, this is cumbersome and inefficient. Such a user flow is akin to that of the early 2000s when emails and early social media expected users to keep refreshing their pages to check if they have any updates. That is, until push notifications arrived.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/petrdu/status/1486059854137643008&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"849\" width=\"680\" title=\"petrduda.eth 💯 on Twitter: &quot;Houston, we have a problem. @BudweiserUSA introduced me to @Sanchezsammyy with an #NFT drop.

We need better tools so artists can reach their fans directly. pic.twitter.com/qEfApBgDbZ / Twitter&quot;\" class=\"ek n fc dx bg\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nNowadays, push notifications are so engraved into our lives that without it things will not be the same. The value of platform-to-user communication and vice versa is crucial to cultivating user retention in the long term.\n\nSuch a communication layer has been lacking in web3 for a long time, that is until EPNS arrived. EPNS is a decentralized communication layer for the Web3 ecosystem. It allows any dApp, protocol, or smart contract to send send communication (starting with on chain / off chain / gasless notifs) tied to user wallet addresses in an open, gasless, multichain and platform agnostic fashion. This allows users to receive updates in real-time without revealing more than their wallet address connected to their favorite platforms and protocols.\n\nLet us explore some of the ways web3 social media platforms and NFT marketplaces can leverage EPNS to effectively communicate with their users:\n\n### NFT Trading (Buy, Sell, Auction, Offers)\nNFT Marketplaces need to communicate with their users when one’s NFT has received an offer or got sold. This sort of communication is crucial for a trader’s user experience in a marketplace.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/opensea/status/1534957511777914881&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"983\" width=\"680\" title=\"OpenSea on Twitter: &quot;New drop from @playSHRAPNEL goes live at 1pm PST 👀check out the deets below ↯ https://t.co/qYpiJzAsXe / Twitter&quot;\" class=\"ek n fc dx bg\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nThe idea is to bring notifications to users when activities happen on the marketplace. For example, an NFT is bought or sold, or even when someone has put up an offer for it. The need for realtime notifications also arise during NFT auctions where time is of the essence in most cases. Notifications allow NFT traders to know if they either won an auction or if they got outbid, this allows them to make educated decisions and be on top of the situation.\n\nPopular NFT activities can also be monitored by tracking its on-chain movement and notifying interested users, this allows users to create watchlists for NFTs they are eyeing for when they are put for sale or for any other reason.\n\n### Artist drops and New Project Launches\nWith new projects and celebrity and artist drops happening every day, it is hard to keep track of what is happening and when. With the help of EPNS, fans can finally get notified when their favorite artist is about to drop their next collection, or if a new promising project goes live. Users can follow these creators and be notified of news that could be interesting to them.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/beeple/status/1536413438347460616&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"753\" width=\"680\" title=\"beeple on Twitter: &quot;ART BASEL pic.twitter.com/uUDllQyFZf / Twitter&quot;\" class=\"ek n fc dx bg\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n### NFT’s are GOOD!\nSome projects are more than just being a marketplace, like [DoinGud](https://twitter.com/DoinGudHQ), which is a social marketplace focused on inspiring creativity and positive social impact.\n\nSpeaking of creators, there’s a great project we are collaborating up with which is celebrating Manga culture and OG NFTs being the first platformless P2E called [CryptoMangaNFT](https://twitter.com/CryptoMangaNFT)\n\nAnd then of course we have your most famous [ENS domains](https://twitter.com/ensdomains), which also are your own NFTs! And with most domains, you’d know they become priceless especially if they’re unique and in the Web3 world in the future, those domain names for your wallet will become all the more important if they’re unique! Having said that, you might forget when they expire, given that most folks buy it for extended periods.\n\nAlways good to be notified about that right? Given the value? We have built an ENS domain expiration channel that can notify users when their ENS domain is about to expire, so you never miss out on your domain name. To subscribe to the ENS channel head to [app.epns.io](http://app.epns.io/) and opt-in.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.webp)\n\n### The Social Network for NFTs (chat, like, share, comments)\nAs the NFT ecosystem explodes, complimentary NFT platforms are gaining traction. These platforms can help users explore new NFTs, connect communities, measure social engagement in a decentralized manner, platforms like Lenster, TryShowtime.\n\nThe current state of web3 social media is still evolving and EPNS is the perfect solution that allows for protocol to user communication in a decentralized manner. With EPNS, an on-chain or off-chain action can be used to trigger a notification, and hence be able to disperse information to the concerned people right at their fingertips. EPNS soon to be launched wallet to wallet chat will be an interesting addition to the social lego for creator economy — connecting buyers- sellers, group messaging, artist- fans, and even platform-to-user and vice versa communication such as customer care services, etc.\n\nNFTVerse is still an early market, but there is a significant opportunity for native communication to accelerate the adoption.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion.

As such, Stox will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their portfolio, mainly when their NFTs are sold.\n\n### Stox: The Portfolio Tracker\nStox is a global, all-asset portfolio tracker that allows users to track their investments in over 25 equity markets, metals, and mutual funds. However, the platform focuses on web3, allowing users to invest in and track their crypto and NFT portfolios. Investors can automatically import their Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) trades onto the Stox platform. They can also record any transaction done on the platform.\n\nA platform like this allows users to bring all of their under a single roof, making it easier for them to track, manage, and make adjustments to their portfolio. Stox has a beginner-friendly user interface with widgets and hashtags for quick glances. The best part is that Stox supports NFT investments and allows users to buy and sell NFTs on the platform.\n\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\nThe goal of our collaboration with Stox is the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows direct interaction with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and users of Stox can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications whenever one of their NFTs is sold.\n\nThis saves users from having to manually check for all of these updates, which makes the platform easier to use and increases the number of people who use it. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a DAPP, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\n\nWe’re excited to strike this alliance with Stox and hope to become an integral part of their operations.\n\n### About Stox\nStox is a global all asset investment tracker with a strong focus on web3 and social investing, for the masses\n\nStay in touch!

The Graph is an indexing protocol that indexes, organises and makes data accessible from networks like Ethereum and IPFS It is often referred to as “Google” for the blockchains. As more and more data finds its way on-chain, users and developers need to access organised data efficiently.\n\nToday, EPNS is excited to announce integration of The Graph to combine the power of subgraphs with notifications! The integration leverages a core EPNS feature that enables developers to establish customised notifications and “call to actions” so they can more easily access data.\n\n### About EPNS X The Graph Integration\nBefore we dive into the integration, let’s give you an overview of what each one of us have been doing to give you a better understanding of how this integration works, who it is targeted to, and what benefits users will gain.\n\n#### About Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)\n\nEPNS is a decentralised communication protocol for web3! It allows any dapp, smart contract, backend or protocol to send communication directly to user wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion.\n\n#### About The Graph\n\nThe Graph is the indexing and query layer of web3. Developers build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL. Tens of thousands of developers use The Graph for applications such as Uniswap, Synthetix, KnownOrigin, Art Blocks, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Audius, Decentraland, and many others.\n\nNow, back to the <b>EPNS x The Graph</b>integration and how it helps. Until this integration, channel creators or developers have to:\n\n1. Create a channel, which is mandatory.\n2. Once a channel is created, you will need to send out notifs, for which you have to set/define logics at the back end.\n\nTo send notifs on your channel, there were two methods which you can use:\n\n1. Using the backend SDK ([Showrunners Framework](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework-and-backend-sdk-beta-v1-0-are-live-7348c0725a12))\n2. Using [smart contracts](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/examples/smart-contracts-example)\n\nHowever to do so, both methods required a decent amount of development work to code the logic using the SDKs.\n\nWith The Graph integration, you’ll now be able to send EPNS notifications directly from your subgraph. With this new integration using the subgraph and EPNS, we are simplifying the process and minimising the need for extra development.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.webp)\n<ImageText>High level integration diagram</ImageText>\n\nTo expand on this, let’s take a look at how this feature and integration is enabling a better way to access indexed data from the blockchain to send notifications.\n\n### What does The Graph help with?\n- The biggest pain point you are able to address via The Graph is fetching data from the blockchain and customising it the way you want. Typically, if you were trying to do this directly from the blockchain, it would be very inefficient.\n- There hasn’t been a specific aggregator to check/run queries of all transactions in one place. And that’s where The Graph comes in. Using a subgraph, you can define how you want to see your data, automatically indexing each block from the blockchain.\n- Mainly querying data via a backend from the blockchain takes a lot of time and is a centralised approach, and that’s something that subgraphs help with\n- Subgraphs also have the ability to index different blockchains. Community members can directly query the data from the subgraph.\n\n### Where does EPNS come in?\n- Using EPNS, developers can get notifications via their channels on EPNS, and get better access to the indexed data created via their subgraphs with this new integration.\n- If your channel doesn’t have a subgraph, you can first define that in a subgraph and then further use this new feature to send notifs as per your logic.\n- Illustrating via an example, if you’ve deployed a Uniswap contract and a swap’s happening, then the developer can define an action as to what should happen if a swap event has happened. And accordingly push notifications for them.\n- The integration eases the process, reduces the time of sending custom notifs by simply integrating the subgraph without the need of a server or spending too much time coding your own logic at the back end.\n\n### Benefits of the EPNS x The Graph integration\n- With this integration, notifications can directly be triggered from a subgraph(see our [lightpaper](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ethereum-push-notification-service-litepaper-e7ca0a662862) for definitions of channels, services, and more)\n- Developers can use all the power and flexibility of subgraphs and use that as the logic for their notifications.\n\nNote: Subgraph integration is available on staging right now.\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>\nReal-time push notifications were for a long time a missing part in the web3 stack. EPNS solves this with a decentralised notification system. Thanks to the integration with The Graph it is much easier to send those notifications to users. A subgraph can now be used as the trigger for notifications. This is very convenient for dapps which already have a subgraph and I also expect that this will become the default setup in the future. — <b>Simon Emanuel Schmid, Solutions Engineer at Edge & Node working on The Graph</b>\n\nWith growing adoption of decentralised infrastructure, simplifying data and making it accessible for users will be key. We see The Graph and EPNS as a great opportunity to bring the most seamless user experience to dapp developers. We are looking forward to working with The Graph team to make the decentralised network even stronger with this integration. — <b>Harsh Rajat, EPNS founder</b> .\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

Can’t believe it’s already week -3!! It’s been an amazing learning experience so far. A big shout out to the [ETHGlobal Team](https://medium.com/u/8687f4bcbbed?source=post_page-----f5f5a1a2c477--------------------------------) for always being there to help and organizing the best AMAs and office hours sessions. Getting feedback and ideas from the devs at [Aavesome](https://medium.com/u/13bfa9f22920?source=post_page-----f5f5a1a2c477--------------------------------), Compound, etc has made this learning process about DeFi landscape and tech amazingly fun.\n\nTo begin with, we never wanted to deliver plain notifications to the users. We mean they are cool but there are so many things you can do when you make notifications behave like your twitter feed. This led us to think a lot about the payloads, analogies and the way we want to present notifications… and that’s how we came up with… drumbeats… notification feed and different formats of notifications.\n\n### Groups and secrets…and secret groups?!\nLet’s talk about the recipients of notifications first. Yes, there are two different target recipients: Groups and Secrets. Simply put, a channel owner or smart contract can send a broadcast to all recipients of their channel or can send encrypted messages (known as secret) to an individual person.\n\n#### Group Messages\n\nGroup messages serve the purpose of communicating a piece of information to a subscribed channel. For example, Gitcoin can alert the developer community about the recently added 1000USD bounty task to its pool (that would be exciting!!).\n\nBut wait, there’s more… we went a step further…while group messages are a great way to send out notifications to a group of users, we thought the ability to send encrypted messages from channel owners to a specific user would really add so much value to push notifications in a variety of different ways.\n\n#### Secret Messages\n\nSo how does the secret message work? Well, blockchain and specifically cryptocurrency has crypto in it for a reason, more on the specific details later as we think it needs an article on its own.\n\nThough in brief terms, the way we achieve this is by encrypting few parts of the message payload with a secret that is further encrypted by the user’s public key.\n\nFor example, Aavesome can send its customer a message once the loan liquidation is complete.\n\n### Message attributes\nLet’s talk message attributes aka how rich we can present user’s with the information.\n\nMessages are more useful (and more fun) when they are clickable, when you can interact with them and when they contain a number of great contexts. This was the approach we used to form different attributes for the message.\n\nThe idea is to give the channel owners enough flexibility so that they can play with permutations and combinations of message types and come up with intuitive messages for their users.\n\nThere are 4 message attributes.\n\n1. Subject\n2. Message text\n3. Call To Action (CTA)\n4.

Here we tried to make the message more interesting by introducing rich text format. Supporting text styles, bold, italics, colors, links, etc can be sent for enhanced user readability. This is a classic format of push notification to share key updates with the subscribed user group.\n\nFor example, it would be awesome to get notified when Uniswap V2 platform is launched this Q2 through a simple notification.\n\nWe took a stab at generating a few examples for the purpose of demonstrating how epns push notifications look in real life.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.webp)\n<ImageText>Looks like we are invited to the party!!</ImageText>\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-2.webp)\n<ImageText>General Message Type</ImageText>\n\nTaking it further, epns messages lets the user tap on a link embedded in the notification. This type of message includes a Call to Action(CTA) wrapped in a group message explained above. This CTA+group message type is meant for a group of users to guide them to a dedicated web page of an event, news, sign-up form, etc.\n\nFor example, the [ETHGlobal Team](https://medium.com/u/8687f4bcbbed?source=post_page-----f5f5a1a2c477--------------------------------) can send out a notification to all hackers for 2021 Virtual Hackathon registration, the user has to simply click on the link in the feed to find the registration form.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-3.webp)\n\nNow, these messages get more interesting when integrated with secret messages (meant for a single user). These targeted or smart CTAs can help enhance user experience as they securely deliver the right message to the right user.\n\nFor example, Binance DEX can send user notifications once their trade order is fulfilled.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-4.webp)\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-5.webp)\n\nBut wait!! EPNS notifications can support images as well. A secret message with images can do so many cool things for a user.\n\nFor example, if a user's ENS domain name is in grace period and about to expire, the ENS team can send out encrypted QR image-based notification to its users. The user can then simply scan the QR image on their ENS domain page to complete the renewal and payment process.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-6.webp)\n<ImageText>\nEncrypted Image Message\n</ImageText>\n\nWe think there are multiple ways in which epns push notifications can add value to the decentralized finance ecosystem. The possibilities and use cases with epns notifications are endless and we are just getting started :)\n\n<b>TLDR; try out the (almost complete) <a href='https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-system/epns-mobile-app'>react native</a> app.</b>\n\nNext up, the dApp and the smart contract…Please feel free to share your support and amazing feedback.\n\n### About Push Protocol\n\nPush is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with Push Protocol: [Website](https://push.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService), and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/pushprotocol)."

We are quite happy with the app specs and don’t think that will change anytime soon while we wanted to think and iterate a bit more on smart contract so we choose this route. Without further ado, Let’s dive into how we are going to create the magic in the mobile app.\n\n### Features\nThe EPNS mobile app is built using react native and provides the following features:\n\n- App should be able to receive push notifications.\n- App should be able to connect the user’s wallet (singular at the moment) in a secure manner.\n- App should connect the user wallet to the push notification device tokens that are generated by Apple Push Notification Service or Android Push Notification Service.\n- App should be able to send this information to the epns server in a secure format.\n- App should be able to fetch user notifications (kind of like emails) that were already delivered to them.\n\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.webp)\n<ImageText>We all get a notification, woohoo !!</ImageText>\n\n### Tech Specs\nMobile push notifications use [device tokens](https://help.pushwoosh.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000364923-What-is-a-Device-token-) for registration of the device and the push notification server then sends out mass or specific messages using these device tokens. For EPNS to work, we need to register these device tokens as well as the wallet to which they belong to.\n\nFor the EPNS Service to work, the following modules need to be built:\n\n- Storing User Wallet Private Key (Offline on the User’s Device)\n- Mapping user’s wallet address to device tokens\n- Communicate with the epns server to verify and store these device tokens (mapped to wallet address)\n- Handling Incoming Push Notifications\n- Fetching Previous Notifications of the User\n\n#### Storing User Wallet Private Key (Offline on the User’s Device)\n\nThe app needs to store the user’s wallet private key to decrypt the message received by the user and to encrypt the token registration process. This ensures that the epns server only maps the verified device tokens to the user wallet.\n\nFurthermore, we need to provide either biometric or passcode based security to the user in the app since the app is storing sensitive user credentials. We will also be storing these user credentials in an encrypted format, we will mostly be using [React-Native-Keychain](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-keychain) for this.\n\n#### Mapping user’s wallet address to device tokens\n\nOnce a user has imported the wallet, the device tokens which are generated would be mapped to the wallet of the user.\n\n#### Communicate with the epns server to verify and store these device tokens (mapped to wallet address)\n\nWe will mostly be using [Eth-Crypto](https://github.com/pubkey/eth-crypto) to handle the secure verification process.\n\nCurrent proposal is to send the operation code as <b>Register</b> along with the device token as the signature of the user using the above library and the public wallet address. The server will first decrypt the hash to find the public wallet address of the user and will only proceed if the public wallet address sent matches with the decrypted address of the public wallet. This ensures that spoofing can’t be done by any user to receive notifications meant for the intended recipients.\n\nTo know more about the server and it’s architecture, please head to [[epns-push-notification-server repo](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-system)]\n\n#### Handling Incoming Push Notifications\n\nThe push notification handling (for when the app is open) will also be built to handle notifications received by the users when they are inside the app.\n\n#### Fetching Previous Notifications of the User\n\nTBA. We are still contemplating storing a cache on the epns server or handle it alternatively, community brainstorming is welcome :)\n\nTLDR; try out the (not so complete work in progress) [react native](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-system/epns-mobile-app) app.\n\nPlease feel free to share your support and amazing feedback.

Notifications can be sent via the web, mobile, and Web3.0 providers like Metamask. To ensure consistent messaging throughout the project we have created the following nomenclature of terms, roles that will be used in the rest of the project lifecycle.\n\n- Contract Owner — The owner of the contract, specifically the address by whom the contract is deployed.\n- App Owner — Referred to as <b>Channel Owners</b>. The third-party projects, dApps or smart contract, specifically the address which form their identity as well as the custom opt-in group that the subscribed users will receive message from.\n- Users — All the users who don’t fall in either of the above categories.\n- App Owner Group — Referred to as <b>Channel</b>. The group which contains subscribed users of a particular channel.\n- Subscribed Users — The users who have subscribed to a specific channel.\n\nFor the purpose of explaining the above EPNS terms, let’s take the example of Youtube and the various associated roles.\n\n- Youtube — Contract Owner\n- Channels — App Owner Groups\n- Channel Owners — App Owners\n- Users — Users\n- Subscribed Users — Users subscribed to a specific App owner group\n\n<b>Game Theory -- Push</b>\n\nIn order to ensure the proper participation of all roles, following game theory is proposed, features marked with *** will mostly be excluded from the upcoming MVP:\n\n- The <b>contract owner</b> doesn’t have any ability to send messages on behalf of <b>channel owners</b>.\n- The <b>channel owners</b> might spoof other trusted apps and thus will have to be verified or a spam system developed so that users can mark them as spoof or a similar mechanism.\n- The <b>channel owners</b> need explicit permission from the users before messages can be sent to them.\n- The <b>channel owners</b> need to stake some minimum DAI to ensure a spam-free environment, this is going to be minimal but good enough to ascertain good behavior (for example, 50 DAI).\n- The <b>users</b> need to transact on blockchain to specifically subscribe or unsubscribe to a channel, this leads to an incentive issue, ie: why would a user spend gas in most cases?\n- To counter this, The staked DAI from <b>channel owners</b> can inturn be used as an incentive for <b>users</b> to subscribe to the specific channel.\n- This can be done by using services like AAVE to accrue interest on the said DAI and distribute it to the subscribed users group.\n- This incentivizes the users to spend gas to perform “subscribe” transaction operation.\n- The <b>channel owners</b> can stake more DAI if they want to since the users are incentivized to subscribe.\n- The <b>channel owner</b> can blacklist a certain user from their channel if they want to.\n- The <b>channel owners</b> can reclaim this DAI back, reclaiming this DAI will also destroy the channel, a fee of 10 DAI will also be held back for the <b>contract owner</b>, the fees is small enough for serious players to not worry about but will act as a further deterrent for bad players.\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback and ideas to better the overall experience.
