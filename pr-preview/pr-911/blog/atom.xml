<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of Web3, user experience (UX) remains a pivotal factor in driving adoption and sustaining engagement.</p>
<p>One of the key innovations and the current <em>hot</em> narrative of web3 aiming to improve the overall UX of web3 apps is <strong>Chain Abstraction</strong>.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Chain Abstraction aims to create a seamless and intuitive experience for users and developers, by simplifying interactions across multiple blockchain networks, bridging the gap between complex blockchain mechanics and everyday usability.</p>
<p>This article delves into the core concept of Chain Abstraction, explores its technical benefits, underscores its significance for the broader Web3 vision, and highlights what we at Push are doing to improve the UX of our applications.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="first-lets-understand-chain-abstraction">First, Let’s Understand Chain Abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#first-lets-understand-chain-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First, Let’s Understand Chain Abstraction" title="Direct link to First, Let’s Understand Chain Abstraction">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Chain Abstraction</strong> refers to the combined effort of hiding the complexities associated with interacting with multiple blockchain networks, allowing users and developers to engage with decentralized applications (dApps) without needing to manage the intricacies of each underlying chain. Essentially, it acts as an intermediary layer that simplifies cross-chain interactions, enabling seamless communication and functionality across diverse blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p>The fundamental idea behind Chain Abstraction is to create a unified user experience that abstracts away the differences between various blockchain protocols.</p>
<p>This means that users can perform actions on a dApp without having to switch networks, manage multiple wallets, or understand the technical nuances of each blockchain. By streamlining these interactions, Chain Abstraction aims to make Web3 more accessible and user-friendly, fostering broader adoption and sustained engagement.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enhancing-web3-dapp-ux-through-chain-abstraction">Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#enhancing-web3-dapp-ux-through-chain-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction" title="Direct link to Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="simplified-user-interactions">Simplified User Interactions<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#simplified-user-interactions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Simplified User Interactions" title="Direct link to Simplified User Interactions">​</a></h3>
<p>One of the primary benefits of Chain Abstraction is the simplification of user interactions with dApps. Currently, users often need to switch between different blockchain networks to access various functionalities, which can be cumbersome and deter non-technical users.</p>
<p>Here is a quick glance at what the typical web3 user needs to deal with today in this multi-chain web3 ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>managing multiple wallets,</em></li>
<li><em>managing multiple native tokens/assets in their multiple wallets,</em></li>
<li><em>understanding the nuances of each network,</em></li>
<li><em>navigating multiple networks to perform simple tasks,</em></li>
<li><em>interacting with complicated dApp UIs with frequent network switching,</em></li>
<li><em>navigate through inconsistent user interfaces,</em></li>
<li><em>relying on the risky route of cross-chain bridging between chains,</em></li>
<li><em>experiencing difficulty in maintaining a consistent cross-chain identity due to the multi-chain ecosystem,</em></li>
<li><em>dealing with the lack of standardization between networks, protocols, etc.</em></li>
<li><em>dealing with the learning curve of understanding different networks, each with its own set of rules, interfaces, and requirements.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that this is just a glance at the UX problem. There are undoubtedly more issues that an experienced web3 user faces daily. The list is even longer when it comes to newbie web3 users.</p>
<p>However, with Chain Abstraction, most of it gets abstracted away.</p>
<p>In other words, chain abstraction shall allow users to only perform the bare minimum actions and delegate all others to specialized on-chain or off-chain actors. These actors can simply take the user’s intent and themselves figure out the best route, chain, transaction order, etc to fulfill the user’s request.</p>
<p>This means that the user can have a significantly simplified on-chain interaction where most of the multi-chain-specific complicated tasks will be abstracted away from them, thus improving the overall UX for an average Joe.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="unified-wallet-management">Unified Wallet Management<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#unified-wallet-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unified Wallet Management" title="Direct link to Unified Wallet Management">​</a></h3>
<p>Managing multiple wallets across different chains is another pain point for users.</p>
<p>Chain Abstraction addresses this by enabling a single wallet interface that can interact with multiple blockchains. This reduces the cognitive load on users, allowing them to manage their digital assets more efficiently as well as more securely from a single platform.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="seamless-cross-chain-transactions">Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#seamless-cross-chain-transactions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions" title="Direct link to Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions">​</a></h3>
<p>Chain Abstraction facilitates seamless cross-chain transactions, eliminating the need for manual bridging or swapping of assets. This not only enhances the speed and efficiency of transactions but also reduces the risk of errors and the potential security vulnerabilities associated with manual bridging processes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enhanced-performance-and-scalability">Enhanced Performance and Scalability<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#enhanced-performance-and-scalability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhanced Performance and Scalability" title="Direct link to Enhanced Performance and Scalability">​</a></h3>
<p>Chain Abstraction can also contribute to improved performance and scalability of dApps. By leveraging the strengths of multiple blockchains, dApps can optimize transaction speeds and reduce congestion on any single network.</p>
<p>This distributed approach ensures that dApps remain responsive and efficient, even as user demand grows.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="security-and-reliability">Security and Reliability<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#security-and-reliability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Security and Reliability" title="Direct link to Security and Reliability">​</a></h3>
<p>While traditional interop or bridging solutions often introduce multiple points of vulnerability. For instance, the reliance on centralized validators or relayers can lead to potential breaches if these entities are compromised. Additionally, bridges typically depend on complex smart contracts and multi-signature schemes, which, if not meticulously audited, become prime targets for attackers. Historical incidents have underscored these risks, with a substantial portion of stolen crypto funds originating from bridge exploits. Most of the <a href="https://medium.com/immunefi/common-cross-chain-bridge-vulnerabilities-d8c161ffaf8f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive crypto hacks</a> in the past have occurred through compromised bridges, highlighting the critical need for more secure cross-chain solutions.</p>
<p>In contrast, Chain Abstraction minimizes these risks by shrinking down the attack surface area to a greater extent as it reduces direct user interactions with various chains. Instead of users navigating multiple networks and managing separate security protocols, Chain Abstraction delegates these responsibilities to specialized on-chain actors, such as intent handlers or solvers.</p>
<p>This delegation not only streamlines the user experience but also centralizes security oversight, allowing for more effective and consistent application of security measures. By handling transactions through a unified interface, Chain Abstraction can implement robust security protocols that ensure transactions are validated and processed securely across all supported chains.</p>
<p>However, it's important to recognize that Chain Abstraction introduces new points of security consideration. The addition of abstraction layers and off-chain components, like handlers or solvers, necessitates a reevaluation of the security framework. While these layers reduce the attack surface by limiting direct interactions with multiple chains, they also require their own stringent security measures. Ensuring the integrity and security of these new components is crucial, as any vulnerabilities within the abstraction layer could potentially compromise the entire system.</p>

<p>At Push Protocol, we have consistently focused on enhancing the user experience, not only for Push’s own community but also for the entire Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Since the launch of our dApp, we have prioritized a <a href="https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX-driven</a> and security-first strategy.</p>
<p>Whether we’re refining the visual interface, optimizing our smart contracts, or implementing gasless opt-ins for seamless dApp interactions, we remain dedicated to these principles across all facets of our platform.</p>
<p>However, improving UX in web3 involves far more than just building intuitive user interfaces for our applications.</p>
<p>In a multi-chain ecosystem, users have to deal with a lot more complexities, as previously mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>Since Push Protocol supports more than one EVM chain (<em>and soon will support non-evm chains),</em> our dApp’s UX needs to be improved accordingly.</p>
<p>There is a need for us to ensure we abstract away all the multi-chain complexity for our users and provide a single unified interface for them to use.</p>
<p>And, we do this with the <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cross Chain Request Feature.</strong></a></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-cross-chain-requests-ccr">What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#what-is-cross-chain-requests-ccr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?" title="Direct link to What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Cross Chain Requests (CCR)</strong> is a feature recently proposed in <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Protocol’s Pre-PIP 3 governance proposal</a>. It aims to implement Cross Chain Requests within Push Protocol’s smart contracts, namely PushCore and PushComm.</p>
<p>The CCR feature allows users to interact with the PushCore smart contract deployed on the Ethereum chain from any EVM or Non-EVM chain without the need to switch networks. Thus, providing an abstracted experience.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-ccr-enhances-dapp-ux">How CCR Enhances dApp UX<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#how-ccr-enhances-dapp-ux" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How CCR Enhances dApp UX" title="Direct link to How CCR Enhances dApp UX">​</a></h3>

This eliminates the need to switch to Ethereum to interact with PushCore, thereby streamlining the user experience and reducing friction.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Chain Compatibility</strong></p>
<p>CCR shall leverage <a href="https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wormhole’s Native Token Transfer (NTT) architecture</a> and Relayers to enable secure cross-chain message and token bridging.</p>
<p>This allows PushComm contracts deployed on various chains to relay requests to PushCore on Ethereum securely.</p>
<p>Users can initiate actions from their native chains, enhancing the flexibility and convenience of interacting with Push Protocol.</p>
<p>By enabling seamless interactions from any chain, Push Protocol can attract users from various blockchain ecosystems. This broadens the platform’s user base, fostering a more interconnected and diverse community that benefits from enhanced interoperability.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified Channel Creation</strong></p>
<p>For instance, a user like Bob, who operates on Polygon, can create a channel on PushCore without leaving Polygon. By using PushComm’s <em>createChannel()</em> function, Bob can submit channel details and approve necessary tokens directly from Polygon. CCR ensures that the request is securely relayed to PushCore on Ethereum, where the channel is created without Bob needing to navigate complex cross-chain processes.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-are-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>What Are Token-Gated Group Chats?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/token-gated-group-chats#what-are-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-are-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to what-are-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>
<p>Token-gated group chats are web3 native communication spaces where access is restricted based on the ownership of specific blockchain assets such as tokens or NFTs (non-fungible tokens). To put it even more simply, users must hold a certain token or NFT in their wallet to be granted entry to these exclusive group chats. This concept leverages the power of the different <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERC token</a> standard technologies, offering decentralized and permissionless access control to on-chain communities.</p>
<p>These gated communities are becoming an increasingly popular option across all sorts of web3 groups, including DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), NFT collector groups, and on-chain role holders. By tokenizing access, these chats provide a powerful tool for enhancing privacy, fostering trust, and building a strong sense of belonging.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work"><strong>How Do Token-Gated Group Chats Work?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/token-gated-group-chats#how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work" title="Direct link to how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work">​</a></h3>
<p>First, token-gated chats depend on the accurate verification of the assets in a user’s blockchain wallet. In the case of Push’s gated chats, Push Protocol authenticates a user's wallet holdings to ensure they possess the required token or NFT to join the chat. The authentication is automatic, eliminating the need for traditional usernames, passwords, or email sign-ups. This process is seamless, privacy-focused, and ensures that only eligible users gain access to the chat or chats involved.</p>
<p>All of it is done in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Once authenticated, users can join discussions, receive exclusive content, participate in community governance, and more—making these group chats integral to any on-chain community.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>Why Do We Need Token-Gated Group Chats?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/token-gated-group-chats#why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>
<p>The need for token-gated group chats stems from the growing demand for decentralized, transparent, and secure community management tools and workstreams in the web3 space.</p>
<p>Below, we’ve compiled several examples of current and future use cases:</p>
<p><strong>1. Exclusive Access for DAOs:</strong></p>
<p>For DAOs, token-gated group chats offer a mechanism to ensure that only voting members or contributors with skin in the game can participate in decision-making discussions. By using governance tokens as the entry key, DAOs can securely manage spaces where they want only a certain threshold of token holders to participate and share opinions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Having tokenized group chata strengthens governance processes by ensuring that only active, vested members are involved in the DAO's core operations, reducing noise and improving engagement quality.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: DAOs like MakerDAO or Uniswap could create token-gated group chats for core governance contributors or voting members, creating secure spaces for key discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Community Building for NFT Collectors:</strong></p>
<p>NFT projects are built on the idea of exclusive ownership, and token-gated chats are a natural extension of this exclusivity. By allowing only verified NFT holders into private chat rooms, project creators can cultivate tight-knit communities that feel valued, special, and more closely connected to artists, founders, or whoever else the holders bought the NFT to support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: NFT owners get a space where they can engage directly with creators and fellow collectors, access exclusive content, and receive early updates or airdrops.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: A popular NFT collection like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) might use a token-gated chat to offer holders access to exclusive discussions about future projects, merchandise drops, or events.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Enhanced Security and Privacy:</strong></p>
<p>Token-gated group chats inherently provide a higher level of privacy and security compared to traditional centralized platforms. By using cryptographic wallets as authentication, users no longer need to rely on third-party platforms that store personal data. This aligns with the ethos of decentralization and significantly reduces the risks of hacking or data breaches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: No usernames or passwords or any storage of any sort of personal documents is required and there is no risk of sensitive personal information being leaked.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Communities concerned with privacy, like those focused on anonymous or pseudonymous interactions, can use token-gated chats to ensure secure and private communication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Direct Monetization of Communities:</strong></p>
<p>For content creators and influencers, token-gated chats provide a unique opportunity to monetize access to their communities. By selling tokens or NFTs that grant access to their private group chats, they can create an additional revenue stream while giving fans and followers a sense of exclusivity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Fans get special access to behind-the-scenes content, exclusive Q&amp;As, or direct interactions with their favorite creators, while creators benefit from new revenue models.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: A crypto influencer might create a token-gated chat for subscribers who hold a specific NFT, offering them VIP content and advice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>How Hats Protocol Enhances Token-Gated Group Chats</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/token-gated-group-chats#how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>
<p>For DAOs using <strong>Hats Protocol</strong>, the integration of token-gated group chats can significantly streamline their communication processes. Hats Protocol enables the decentralized management of roles and permissions within a DAO, allowing members to be assigned "hats" based on their roles. These hats can also serve as access tokens for group chats, ensuring that only members with the relevant responsibilities can participate in specific discussions.</p>
<p>Here’s how DAOs that use Hats Protocol can benefit from token-gated group chats:</p>
<p><strong>1. Role-Based Chat Access:</strong></p>
<p>Hats Protocol allows DAOs to assign roles on-chain, ensuring that only those members who wear specific hats (such as "Treasury Manager" or "Governance Lead") have access to relevant group chats. This integration ensures that discussions stay focused and are only open to those with the proper permissions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Only relevant DAO members can join key discussions, preventing unqualified members from cluttering important communication channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Dynamic Access Control:</strong></p>
<p>As roles (or hats) within a DAO evolve, access to token-gated chats can dynamically adjust. When someone is promoted, or steps down from a role, their access to group chats is automatically updated, ensuring up-to-date permissions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Access to crucial communication channels remains in sync with the current organizational structure without manual updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Increased Security and Confidentiality:</strong></p>
<p>DAOs can maintain security and confidentiality by ensuring that sensitive topics, such as treasury or governance discussions, are restricted to verified role-holders. Hats Protocol makes it easy to manage and track who holds each hat, ensuring secure communication.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Only authorized members access sensitive information, reducing the likelihood of leaks or mismanagement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Streamlined Team Coordination:</strong></p>
<p>Large DAOs can have multiple teams managing different parts of the organization. Hats Protocol ensures that team members with the relevant roles can communicate within private, token-gated group chats, enhancing collaboration across decentralized teams.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Teams can focus on their responsibilities, while DAO leaders can rest assured that only the right people can access certain discussions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>The Future of Token-Gated Group Chats</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/token-gated-group-chats#the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>

<p>We’re thrilled to share that contributors at <a href="https://cartesi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cartesi</a> have created an integration template for developers to be able to also leverage web3-native communications for DApp builders on Cartesi.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-cartesi"><strong>What is Cartesi?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol#what-is-cartesi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-is-cartesi" title="Direct link to what-is-cartesi">​</a></h3>
<p>Cartesi is an innovative modular blockchain protocol that empowers developers by providing a complete Linux environment along with high-performance rollups. This combination is designed to facilitate the development of advanced next-generation DApps. With it, decentralized applications should be easier, faster, and more scalable than ever before.</p>
<p>Cartesi overcomes the constraints of traditional blockchains by providing developers with a complete Linux operating system and scalable rollups, tailored for real-world applications. This opens up exciting new possibilities for DApps in gaming, DeFi, and other cutting-edge industries, unlocking the future of innovation.</p>
<p>Cartesi-built projects have consistently excelled in <a href="https://ethglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ETHGlobal</a> hackathons with innovative projects like <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/cartenix-7xxe6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cartenix</a>, <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/doom-arena-hmu4j" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doom Arena</a>, and <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/chaingpt-and-accountability-for-ai-agents-doquk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChainGPT</a> gaining considerable traction. These projects not only showcase their commitment to decentralized computation but also highlight Cartesi’s unique ability to unlock new possibilities for scalable, high-performance DApps across various real-world use cases. Other Cartesi Mainnet DApps like <a href="https://rives.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rives</a> and <a href="https://bugbuster.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bug Buster</a> also showed new unforeseen possibilities.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol">How Developers can Integrate Cartesi and Push Protocol:<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol#how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Developers can Integrate Cartesi and Push Protocol:" title="Direct link to How Developers can Integrate Cartesi and Push Protocol:">​</a></h3>
<p>Developer advocacy contributors at Cartesi have demonstrated how developers can integrate push notifications into their Cartesi dApps, enabling users to receive updates related to their activities within the Cartesi rollups environment. Developers can deliver finalized on-chain messages or simple in-app notifications that users care about.</p>
<p>This integration enhances the interactivity of Cartesi DApps, so users can receive timely updates—whether for verified outputs or simple messages—without monitoring epoch finalization.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when managing on-chain assets, where users need to execute a voucher once an epoch is finalized. Vouchers serve as transaction instruments on the base layer blockchain, facilitating operations like asset transfers. They enable modifications to the base layer by reflecting the application's state changes. Read <a href="https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/development/retrieve-outputs/#vouchers-on-chain-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to learn more about vouchers. With notifications powered by Push, Cartesi users can also stay informed about unexecuted vouchers, ensuring they don't miss critical updates, like withdrawing assets.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server"><strong>Technical Deep Dive: The Cartesi Push Notification Server</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol#technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server" title="Direct link to technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server">​</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Mugen-Builders/push-cartesi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cartesi Push Notification Server</a> is a crucial tool that enhances the user experience of Cartesi DApps by providing real-time push notifications. This service is powered by a simple cron job that allows Cartesi DApp creators to notify users of important events, such as those mentioned above, verified outputs, or the availability of vouchers for asset withdrawal, without requiring users to monitor blockchain events like epoch finalization manually.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the On-Chain Asset Challenge:</strong>
One key challenge in decentralized applications involving on-chain assets is the need for users to execute a voucher after an epoch has been finalized. Without notifications, users may miss the execution of vouchers, potentially delaying their withdrawal of assets. The Cartesi Push Notification Server directly solves this problem by alerting users when important events—such as unexecuted vouchers—occur, ensuring they remain informed and can act promptly in response to them.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works: Push Notifications for Cartesi DApps:</strong></p>
<p>The Push Cartesi Notification server operates through a cron job that regularly queries the Graphql server of the Cartesi dApp node to check for new or verified outputs. Here’s how developers can implement it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Push Notification Architecture:</strong>
The Push Cartesi Notification Server leverages a cron job that filters for <a href="https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/development/retrieve-outputs/#notices-off-chain-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notices</a> and verified proofs, sending timely notifications to users about these critical outputs. However, vouchers are intentionally excluded from the cron job, as they are deleted after execution. Instead, the system focuses on notifying users when a proof is available—triggering them to take action, such as executing a voucher.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the architecture of how the Push Cartesi Notification Server works:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Push Cartesi Notification Server" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/assets/images/cover-image1-1a2d7a2eef09d0312d47790fdc03c045.webp" width="1340" height="746" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Creating a Push Notification Channel:</strong>
To start, developers must set up a Push notification channel using <a href="https://push.org/docs/notifications/tutorials/create-your-channel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Protocol’s official guide</a>. The rest of the setup process is explained below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficient Notification Management Using Notices:</strong>
Developers can include a "notice" alongside vouchers to ensure users are properly informed about important, on-chain events. For example, when an NFT is minted, a notice can be generated to notify the user of this event, while the voucher handles the asset’s actual minting process. A notice is a verifiable data statement that confirms off-chain events or conditions, supported by accompanying proof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two Types of Notifications: Instant vs. Proofed:</strong>
Developers have control over when notifications are sent to users through two types of notices:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Instant Notifications: These notifications are sent immediately after a notice is created, allowing users to get real-time updates.</li>
<li>Proofed Notifications: These notifications are sent only when a proof is available, i.e., when the epoch finalizes, ensuring that users are alerted once the output is verified and actionable.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Streamlined Asset Withdrawals:</strong>
The Push/Cartesi notification system is particularly valuable in managing on-chain assets. When users need to withdraw assets, they are alerted when a voucher is ready for execution. By receiving these timely notifications, users can act quickly, avoiding delays or missed withdrawals.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disclaimer: <em>This integration is currently in its alpha stage and relies on certain trust assumptions regarding the Notifications server. Developers are encouraged to use this as an experimental step for integrating push notifications but should not consider it a final, mainnet-ready solution.</em></p>
<p>First, make sure you have created a channel for Push. Once you’ve done so, continue with the below steps to build and run the Notifications server with a sample Cartesi dApp on your local machine.:</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ What is consumer crypto and why does it matter?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of What is consumer crypto and why does it matter?" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/assets/images/cover-image-5c051971b8e8818cad8b2b87e99a3478.webp" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Bitcoin showed us that a decentralized monetary system can work in practice. Ethereum did the same for applications of all shapes and sizes. DeFi extended these principles, demonstrating a wide array of large-scale use cases for institutions and traders alike.</p>
<p>Now, as an industry, we’re on the precipice of our next major tipping point.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto.</p>
<p>It has exploded onto the scene over the past year and continues to dominate web3's zeitgeist. Conferences, podcasts, thought leaders, investors, and builders are all doubling down on its themes.</p>
<p>Major investors are prioritizing consumer crypto projects, particularly in social protocols, apps, and games, highlighting the industry's evolving focus and future direction.</p>
<p>Today, consumer crypto resembles the early days of online businesses during the dot-com boom. While many consumer-focused protocols and apps may be short-lived, a select few are poised to stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Currently, we're in the nascent stages of this boom.</p>
<p>Over the last 5 ETH Global hackathons, 80% of builders building with Push Protocol have chosen to ship projects focused on the consumer crypto niche. This is a major shift from 4 years ago when the same could be said for NFT marketplaces.</p>
<p>However, when you search “consumer crypto,” you get a wide variety of answers as to what it is, why it matters, and where it’s going.</p>
<p>There’s never been a better time than now to sift through the viewpoints and fully grok it.</p>
<p>In this post, we aim to:</p>
<p><em><strong>• Establish a clear definition of consumer crypto</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>• Explore the key reasons for its importance</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>• Comment on its future trajectory</strong></em></p>
<p>Industry professionals are thoroughly split on exactly how to define consumer crypto. Some suggest it all comes back to NFTs and their related token standards. Others say everything in the industry is moving towards consumer scale and has always been meant to go that route.</p>
<p>Others term it the movement focused on web3 apps that are purpose-built for everyday use by billions of people. While this is closer to the point, it doesn’t quite hit the nail on the head either.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto isn’t solely about web3 apps becoming household names.</p>
<p>It also refers to every layer of the stack being hyper-focused on providing novel experiences powered by the blockchain, smart contracts, tokenization, and everything in between. Zooming in, it could then be said that consumer crypto is the niche of the greater crypto industry that’s focused on building the future of all apps and services, powered by blockchain tech.</p>
<p>However, that’s still not quite it.</p>
<p>There’s something more that needs to be included because to scale all things crypto or more accurately, all things web3, to the masses, we need improvements to every level of the industry’s aggregated UX.</p>
<p>However, this concept needs to be simplified for the average person to grasp it. To establish a universal definition for consumer crypto, it's important to first identify and address what isn’t working.</p>
<p>Most consumers object to using crypto or anything related because they don’t see the need to switch to it. They return to the option they already trust and continue interacting within its walls.</p>
<p>This measure of how often users keep coming back to an app is called “stickiness,” and it’s something that web3 apps have yet to achieve on any comparable level to web2’s household names.</p>
<p>Think about why Slack is sticky, even for Web3 teams.</p>
<p>Once you pass a certain threshold of all-time messages sent, it becomes the standard for communication in your workplace. It doesn’t matter, in most cases, how many alternatives pop up. Your historical conversations and all the documents you’ve ever shared are stored in your team’s Slack.</p>
<p>What about Google Meet?</p>
<p>It’s a sticky progressive web app because it seamlessly integrates with your calendar and it just works. You can schedule a meeting in four clicks, counting inputting participating emails, and you don’t even have to have a Gmail to join one you’re invited to.</p>
<p>People keep coming back because, above all else, it’s intuitive to use and it doesn’t lock anyone out.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto, as a whole, is a vision to build out sticky apps that scale far beyond the web3 niche. All in all, the key goal is for them to be just as intuitive to use as their legacy counterparts and more attractive due to the new, on-chain-enabled features they champion.</p>
<p>To narrow down what this means, let's consider the rise of DeFi.</p>
<p>Since 2020, the success of protocols like Aave, Uniswap, and Maker has demonstrated, in practice, the power of transacting with minimal fees, globally, and without intermediaries. Truthfully, the term DeFi, stretches far beyond these protocols and their counterparts to all of crypto that deals in financial use cases. Even Bitcoin, for example, may be considered “DeFi,” when it is used to store value, or simply, to do business.</p>
<p>As institutions like Blackrock continue to buy in, that’s only becoming clearer by the day.</p>
<p>While both DeFi and consumer crypto are niches within the same industry, they have considerably different target markets. DeFi aims to provide the future financial system, piece by piece, to institutions, traders, and individuals.</p>
<p>Consumer Crypto is the vision of developing intuitive, sticky, and user-governed applications that leverage blockchain technology to deliver seamless, chain-abstracted experiences. These applications extend beyond financial services, enabling any user to engage with a diverse range of web3 applications for various purposes, fostering widespread adoption, and enhancing everyday digital interactions.</p>
<p>Below, we dig into why that needs to be done, and how we, as builders, can do it.</p>
<h1>Why does consumer crypto matter?</h1>
<p>The top hurdle for web3, as a whole, continues to be how inaccessible it is to the average person. To change that, we need to commit to radically improving how we onboard new users to our apps, how we seek to retain them, and what use cases we’re building for as well as supporting, through grants programs, hackathons, and otherwise.</p>
<p>Once we achieve this, it will become clear why consumer crypto is essential and why it represents the next paradigm shift for all consumer apps.</p>
<p><strong>Seamless Onboarding</strong></p>
<p>From approval signatures to bridging, to holding multiple tokens just for gas fees on different networks, to managing multiple wallets, <a href="https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and beyond</a>, web3 apps are rife with complexity. Changing the status quo requires unifying the user experience regardless of all these intricacies.</p>
<p>A commitment to learning from web2’s successes and failures is a good start.</p>
<p>Chain abstraction across the board, <a href="https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as we describe in a past post here</a>, takes us further.</p>
<p>Spinning up an account on a web3 app must be as easy if not easier than doing so on something like Facebook.  Simplicity needs to reign across the board in our approach to UX and we need to commit to benchmarking to leading legacy apps that are household names to ensure this happens. Moreover, putting all of the innovations that make this industry great on the back end does not mean hiding them.</p>
<p>Until all of this is achieved, onboarding will continue to be a major barrier to widespread adoption and the advent of an age in which on-chain apps supplant off-chain apps.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Retention</strong></p>
<p>Raising retention is a multi-sided problem. To retain users over the long-term, we must ensure better and seamless UX.</p>
<p>With web2’s common approaches to it and the unique features that web3 has in mind, it becomes easier to solve.</p>
<p>Think about the apps you have on your phone. What reminds you to check them? Push notifications. There’s a reason we still need them, even in this space. When done right, they’re one of the most effective methods that apps employ to retain users.</p>
<p>When your phone’s locked and you receive a push notification saying that you got a new message from a friend on an app, you check that app. It’s a reflex, in most cases. The same principle applies to web3. If you’re a trader and you get a push notification in your wallet that says the asset you’re tracking has reached the price you’re looking for, you’ll head to your account and trade that asset. Delegates for a DAO who receive the same sort of notification that a vote has begun will head to Snapshot or wherever that vote is being held to participate. The same goes for fans of a particular NFT artist who receive a ping that a new drop is live or fans of a podcaster who see that a new episode is live.</p>
<p>Push notifications are still key to keeping people engaged, even on-chain.</p>
<p>Beyond push notifications, numerous other methods for enhancing user retention exist, both predating web3 and emerging from it. The initial rise of NFTs has already shown the power of royalties, guaranteed in perpetuity, by smart contracts. Most legacy marketplaces and social media platforms offer only negligible profit-sharing, if any.</p>
<p>It’s the call for change we’ve seen since the earliest days of social media. Give us apps that prioritize the users, including creators, first, above all else.</p>
<p>Add in DAOs as well as the lego-like composability that smart contract-based applications have and you’re starting to get the picture as to how consumer crypto can do that. At present, both creators and general users lack meaningful upside in the apps they use daily. Any significant gains—monetary or otherwise—are subject to the whims of centralized entities.</p>
<p>User-led apps flip the status quo on its head, for the better.</p>
<p>If something isn’t working, it can be changed via a vote. Apps evolve based directly on what their communities want to see and any advertising that is done is opt-in.</p>
<p>Any revenue that’s generated goes both to the app itself, to keep the lights on and keep it scaling, and to its community, with the latter receiving the lion’s share.</p>
<p>Token-based incentives such as higher statuses and higher rewards based on longevity and participation further increase retention even further.</p>
<p><strong>Diversification of Use Cases</strong></p>
<p>However, none of the above matters if we, as an industry, can't demonstrate a stronger commitment to a broader range of use cases for our apps. Currently, the majority of existing web3 apps are DeFi-focused.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto aims to change that by providing intuitive, fun, sticky apps that rival those that are today’s leaders in the social media, gaming, and marketplace niches. Chain abstraction, <a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cross-chain requests</a>, and <a href="https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">related solutions</a> are making it easier than ever for that to happen.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, through recent hackathons, we’re already able to see consumer apps leading the charge.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto matters because it’s the movement through which web3 expands its boundaries to the next billion users.</p>
<p>It’s the only way that we finally cross the chasm to being the standard-bearers for all online interaction instead of a tech-heavy alternative.</p>
<p>Once everyone in our industry shows commitment to that in practice, consumer crypto will become the dominant driving force for the industry’s move to expand crypto beyond finance and achieve widespread adoption.</p>
<h1>What’s the future of consumer crypto?</h1>
<p>Since Bitcoin's inception, we've advocated for a financial system and a world that levels the playing field more than ever before. Our apps need to strike a balance—easy to use, yet demonstrating these principles in action. We need more engaging, participatory, on-chain economies, of all shapes and sizes, embedded within enjoyable user interfaces.</p>
<p>This doesn’t require reinventing the wheel. Our next break-out moment may come from a team saying, <em>“How can we make a better Instagram with features and functionalities unique to this industry?”</em></p>
<p>That app would likely also be DAOified because you can’t have consumer crypto without governance by the people, for the people. Decentralized Governance, as an overarching model for our future social apps, aligns perfectly with the broader vision of consumer crypto, as it ensures apps evolve in a more participatory fashion than ever before. Web3-app users can have a direct say in how the app they’re using evolves as well as how it approaches key questions like compensation for creators, which is technically not possible in traditional web3 apps, where all control lies in the hands of the few.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto is the next <strong>Schelling</strong> point for our industry.</p>
<p>It's the driving force propelling us toward a future where web3 becomes the standard for all global consumers' online interactions. To travel further down that road, let’s start by building things on-chain that people beyond our sphere, legitimately want to use. Let’s also commit to making crypto easier to use than ever.</p>
<p>With that, we might reach an age in which a web3 app is just an app and a protocol is just a structure behind it.</p>
<p>An age of seamless interaction, on-chain,  where users no longer have to bother about the underlying chain behind their favorite applications.</p>
<p>Here at Push, we’re all aligned and focused on this vision.</p>
<p>If you're building in consumer crypto, then we're here to support you every step of the way. <a href="https://gov.push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reach out to us</a> and we’ll get you plugged in with our grants program.</p>]]></content>

<p>It has been around 9 years since Ethereum was born.</p>
<p>It's been 9 years since Ethereum first launched, marking the beginning of a revolutionary era in blockchain technology. What began as a general-purpose blockchain has evolved into a global, decentralized World Computer, unlocking a wave of technological innovations through the power of cryptography and decentralization.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, the landscape has dramatically shifted.</p>
<p>We have over <a href="https://dune.com/21co/layer-2-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 Layer 2 solutions</a>, numerous rollups and now even Layer 3s. With such an explosion of chains what we now have is a fragmented ecosystem where user experience is compromised, liquidity is spread thin across multiple platforms, security of assets is a major concern, and building applications in the multi-chain world is getting increasingly difficult.</p>
<p><em>But how did we get here?</em></p>
<p>This article is designed to give a complete picture of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How web3 ended up with so many chains,</em></li>
<li><em>How this has adversely affected the entire ecosystem,</em></li>
<li><em>And, what we can do to build better web3 apps in this multi-chain world</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-rise-of-chains">The Rise of Chains<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux#the-rise-of-chains" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Rise of Chains" title="Direct link to The Rise of Chains">​</a></h3>
<p>Since the advent of layer 1 chains, scalability and high fee (gas) requirements have been a major concern. For chains like Ethereum specifically, as the number of applications grew, so did the network’s congestion and the overall cost for users.</p>
<p>A significant step to resolve these issues was taken on October 02, 2020, when Vitalik introduced the <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rollup-Centric Ethereum Roadmap</em></a>. This meant Ethereum moved towards rollups as its scaling strategy because <strong>bundling multiple transactions</strong> <strong>into batches</strong> significantly increased <em><strong>transaction throughput</strong></em> and <em><strong>reduced transaction costs.</strong></em></p>
<p>This solved Ethereum's scalability issue effectively as it reduced the load on the Layer 1 chain and provided cheaper transaction fees. However, we soon realized that the rollup-centric roadmap had led to the development of plethora of new L2s, Rollup solutions, and even L3s. This expansion has enabled greater scalability and reduced transaction costs, which are essential for the growth of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p>Additionally, the web3 ecosystem soon realized the need for designing chains that are specifically optimized for single applications, i.e. app-specific chains. Technically, this seemed necessary to ensure that these applications could achieve optimal performance, security, and user experience tailored to their unique requirements without being affected by the general-purpose network congestion and fees of more generic Layer 1 or Layer 2 solutions.</p>
<p>While app-specific chains achieved the desired outcome by optimizing for their specific needs, this again led to the creation of multiple new chains. L3s as applications like dYdX, Hyperliquid, or Frax became standalone app chains or rollups of their own.</p>
<p>This inception of new rollups, app chains, L2, and L3s undoubtedly resolved quite a few key issues of the ecosystem like <em>scalability, block space, network usage fees</em>, etc. However, it also led to another significant concern for web3 users and devs.</p>
<p>A deep dive into this topic will lead us to many concerns that arise with the significant proliferation of chains such as f<em>ragmentation of liquidity across chains, inadequate incentive management, broken user experience, difficulties for developers, security risks, etc.</em></p>
<p>However, in this article, we will primarily focus on the ones that affect either the existing users or the newcomers.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-fall-of-web3-ux">The Fall of Web3 UX<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux#the-fall-of-web3-ux" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Fall of Web3 UX" title="Direct link to The Fall of Web3 UX">​</a></h3>
<p>As the number of chains has multiplied, so have the challenges, particularly in terms of user experience (UX). With the rise of these new chains, the overall UX of web3 has become increasingly complex for the average user to navigate.</p>
<p>Here is a quick glance at what a typical web3 user needs to deal with in this multi-chain universe:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>managing multiple wallets,</em></li>
<li><em>managing multiple native tokens/assets in their multiple wallets,</em></li>
<li><em>understanding the nuances of each network,</em></li>
<li><em>navigating multiple networks to perform simple tasks,</em></li>
<li><em>interacting with complicated dapp UIs with frequent network switching</em></li>
<li><em>navigate through inconsistent user interfaces</em></li>
<li><em>relying on the risky route of cross-chain bridging between chains</em></li>
<li><em>experiencing difficulty in maintaining a consistent cross-chain identity due to the multi-chain ecosystem</em></li>
<li><em>dealing with the lack of standardization between networks, protocols, etc</em></li>
<li><em>dealing with the learning curve of understanding different networks, each with its own set of rules, interfaces, and requirements.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that this is just a glance at the UX problem. There are undoubtedly more issues issues for a web3 user daily. The list is even longer when it comes to newbie web3 users.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned issues lead to a few major hurdles for not just users but also for developers as well as the entire web3 ecosystem:</p>
<p><strong>Fragmented User Experience</strong></p>
<p>The main drawback of navigating a multi-chain world is, well, the <em><strong>multiple chains</strong></em> (<em>instead of just one)</em>. And that leads to a completely fragmented user experience.</p>
<p>A continual requirement for users to switch between chains, often using different wallets or interfaces for each one makes it challenging for users to keep track of their assets or manage their interactions with dApps. As a result, many find the Web3 experience confusing and overwhelming, which can deter them from using these services altogether.</p>
<p><strong>User Retention Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Poor UX can directly impact user retention.</p>
<p>Truth be told, it already is impacting user retention.</p>
<p>When users encounter difficulties in navigating the web3 ecosystem, they are less likely to return to it. High-profile dApps that have struggled with user retention due to UX issues serve as cautionary tales for new projects entering the space. Complex interfaces, slow transaction times, and confusing wallet setups have all contributed to a decline in user engagement and adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Security and Trust Concerns</strong></p>
<p>The complexity of managing multiple chains also introduces security risks.</p>
<p>Users must ensure that they are interacting with the correct chain, using the right wallet, and understanding the implications of each transaction. This complexity increases the likelihood of user errors, such as sending assets to the wrong address or falling victim to phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the process of bridging assets between these chains is quite often cumbersome and fraught with risks. Users must rely on various bridging protocols, which not only add to the complexity but also introduce potential security vulnerabilities. For instance, a user willing to move tokens from Ethereum to an L2 solution must navigate multiple steps, including wrapping and unwrapping tokens, which can be a deterrent for new users.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Complexity for Builders</strong></p>
<p>The rise of multiple chains was never just a UX problem for the users of web3. There’s more to it. It has also introduced a host of extra challenges for developers and builders in the space.</p>
<p>For example, each chain often has its own development tools, SDKs, and environments that developers must learn &amp; adapt to, which can be time-consuming and lead to inconsistencies in development practices. Maintaining applications that operate across multiple chains requires managing multiple codebases or conditional code paths. This can lead to significant maintenance overhead, especially when chains update their protocols or APIs.</p>
<p>Each additional chain integrated into an application introduces new potential vulnerabilities. Developers must ensure that the security of cross-chain interactions is robust, as any weakness could lead to exploits or hacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, developing for a multi-chain ecosystem that still lacks adequate standardization - is costly. It requires more time and resources, as developers need to learn and implement different protocols, test on multiple platforms, and ensure compatibility across the whole environment involved. The additional cost of extensive security audits makes the process of building &amp; maintaining apps even more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Barrier to Mass Adoption</strong></p>
<p>The above-mentioned problems are issues that affect not just users but the web3 world as a whole.</p>
<p>One of the biggest barriers to the mass adoption of Web3 is poor UX. While early adopters and tech-savvy users may be willing to navigate the complexities of the blockchain, the average user is likely to be put off by the steep learning curve. To achieve widespread adoption, Web3 dApps must prioritize UX and make it as easy as possible for users to interact with their services. This means simplifying interfaces, reducing the need for users to understand the underlying technology, and providing clear, concise instructions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="so-what-can-we-do-about-it">So, What Can We Do About It?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux#so-what-can-we-do-about-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So, What Can We Do About It?" title="Direct link to So, What Can We Do About It?">​</a></h3>
<p>Web3 has come as far as it has today by collaborating to solve the major problems of the ecosystem from providing decentralized infrastructure to solving scalability concerns. The current major problem, however, is the fragmented and broken UX of web3 apps.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some teams and protocols have some of the best minds in the industry, already working on solving this problem.</p>
<p>One of the major roadmap items of Ethereum, for instance, is its plans to fix the fragmented ecosystem with <a href="https://ethcc.io/archive/universal-synchronous-composability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Universal Synchronous Composability</strong></em></a>, which undoubtedly would be a massive step towards solving the fragmented world we have today as well as towards providing a better UX for users.</p>
<p>Frameworks like <a href="https://frontier.tech/the-cake-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAKE</a> by Frontier Research as well as protocols like Socket, Particle Network, etc., are all building solutions to provide an abstracted user experience for web3 users where they no longer have to bother about the underlying chains, <em>which in itself resolves more than half of web3 users’ UX issues.</em></p>
<p>Most of these solutions, however, are currently in their nascent stages and it will still take a significant amount of time for them to shape the overall fragmented UX of Ethereum.</p>
<p>Moreover, this does not indicate that it all has been addressed. As web3 builders or protocols, we can still do more to expand the boundaries for improving web3 UX. There are still a few imperative actions that we can take to enhance the experience for our users because as previously mentioned - <em><strong>good UX for users impacts the overall web3 ecosystem positively.</strong></em></p>
<p>In fact, some of those actions can be taken instantly to improve your applications.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>A UX-First Approach to App Development</strong></p>
<p>In simpler terms, this means building your apps in a way that even a newbie web3 user can navigate without having to read a single page of documentation or reach out to you for extra support.</p>
<p>Most web3 applications are usually built with native web3 users in mind. It is simply assumed that users should be well aware of what a <em>hexadecimal blockchain address</em> looks like or what <em>blockchain-based</em> <em>transactions</em> mean.</p>
<p>Dapps with such assumptions, while easy to build, are a nightmare for new users who aren’t tech-savvy and this leads to a bad UX for most users.</p>
<p>To combat this, apps should focus on creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that abstract away the complexity of interacting with the blockchain - <em>as much as possible</em>. This includes providing clear instructions, reducing the number of steps required to complete a transaction, and ensuring that users have access to all of the information they need to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Thus, focus on creating apps with user-friendly designs that prioritize seamless interactions and accessibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide Cross-Chain Support &amp; Solutions If required</strong></p>
<p>Cross-chain interoperability is another critical solution for improving Web3 UX. By enabling seamless communication between different chains, interoperability protocols can reduce the complexity of navigating a multi-chain environment.</p>
<p>If your protocol spreads across multiple chains, you need to figure out ways to make it seamless for your users to navigate through it and the apps built on top of it. Including cross-chain solutions for such cases eventually leads to a better UX for your users.</p>
<p>A good example of this in practice is how Push leverages cross-chain solutions for its <a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCR feature</a> which primarily aims to improve the experience for the users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incentive Structure for Seamless UX</strong></p>
<p>Incentivization could play a key role as well. To encourage developers to prioritize UX, dApps can create incentive structures that reward user-centric design.</p>
<p>This could include offering grants to developers who create user-friendly interfaces, and focus on solving UX challenges in multi-chain environments. This could help fund the creation of tools and features that reduce friction for users by either optimizing existing pieces of software for better performance or simplifying user interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Good UX is more than just a User Interface</strong></p>
<p>A common misconception is to equate good UX solely with fast and visually appealing user interfaces. In reality, a truly great UX goes far beyond just the front-end design.</p>
<p>Two critical components that significantly enhance the overall UX for your users are <em><strong>usability and trust.</strong></em></p>
<p>Unlike traditional Web2 apps, Web3 applications interact with smart contracts, which require gas fees for any on-chain operations. Optimizing these smart contracts to minimize gas consumption is essential. By doing so, you ensure that users can engage with your dApp more cost-effectively, directly improving usability and making your application more accessible to a broader audience.</p>
<p>Moreover, robust security features and a commitment to transparency with users are fundamental to building <strong>reliability and trust.</strong> In the Web3 space, where apps interact with immutable databases—the blockchain—users must be confident in the safety of their transactions. Since most on-chain transactions are irreversible, providing clear security warnings before users commit and giving detailed error messages, and transparent indicators of transaction statuses (including estimated processing times) are crucial for fostering trust.</p>
<p>In addition, conducting thorough audits of your smart contracts to mitigate the risk of exploits is not just a security measure but a vital aspect of UX. Ensuring that users' assets are safe builds confidence and reliability in your app, which is indispensable for an overall positive user experience.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Push Protocol has always aimed to improve the overall user experience for not just its own users but the entire web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Since the launch of our dapp, we have led with the incorporation of a UX-Driven and Security-First approach. Be it visual interface changes to the dapp, optimizations of our smart contract, or enabling gasless opt-ins for smooth dapp interactions, we continue to put this into practice across the board.</p>
<p>Here is a quick glance at the evolution of the Push Dapp since its early days.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Push DApp" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/assets/images/cover-image1-061e8a044eb8e8e2f6db3737f27d97ad.webp" width="2000" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>However, as previously mentioned, UX is more than just user interface improvements.</p>
<p>In particular, maintaining an excellent UX in web3 app with such a fragmented ecosystem could be very challenging.</p>
<p>We faced a similar challenge as well.</p>
<p>Push has built a communication &amp; notification layer for all EVM (<em>and soon, Non-EVM</em>) chains. This means our dapp supports multiple chains which leads to a fragmented experience where user have to frequently switch between chains to perform various actions.</p>
<p>A major improvement to resolve this was recently proposed in the PRE-PIP 3 of Push Governance, i.e., <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Cross Chain Requests.</strong></em></a></p>
<p><strong>Cross Chain Requests ( CCR)</strong>&nbsp;feature shall be one of the most significant features of Push Smart Contracts as it will enable users to perform important actions like c<em>hannel creation, creation of Incentivized Chat requests, or any arbitrary request</em>&nbsp;from the chain of their choice.</p>
<p>The core idea of the Cross Chain Request feature is to&nbsp;<strong>make Push smart contracts capable of handling requests that can originate from any chain and are securely relayed to Push Core contracts on Ethereum for necessary validations &amp; state changes.</strong></p>
<p>In other words, we shall be able to provide an abstracted experience to our users, one in which they no longer have to care about switching to a specific network to interact with the dapp. Users can choose to stay on their preferred chain and the dapp shall be able to handle the rest, thus providing a significantly improved UX in the currently fragmented multi-chain world of Web3.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h3>
<p>The rise of multi-chain environments has undoubtedly brought about significant advancements in scalability and efficiency within the Web3 ecosystem. However, this growth has also introduced new challenges, particularly regarding user experience. As dApps continue to evolve and expand across multiple chains, it is crucial to prioritize UX to ensure that users can navigate the ecosystem with ease.</p>
<p>By focusing on creating unified experiences, leveraging cross-chain interoperability solutions, and simplifying user interfaces, web3 apps can overcome the challenges of a multi-chain world and hopefully drive mass adoption of web3 technology.</p>
<p>To achieve mainstream adoption, it's now imperative that web3 finds ways to streamline these experiences, making it easier for average users to navigate the complex landscape of multiple chains and protocols.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cold Start Solutions: Scaling Consumer Crypto]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Cold Start Solutions: Scaling Consumer Crypto" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/assets/images/cover-image-d6b3f4c7b0a309b6fa28467819b2461d.webp" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We’ve gone from wen moon to wen widespread adoption? We, as builders, stick around in this wild, wonderful space we call home because we envision a more transparent, fairer, and overall better internet.</p>
<p>We want social networks that we’re never actually locked into. We want user-run apps. We envision a world in which we truly own what we share online, whether that’s our messages, our photos, or simply, our data.</p>
<p>Ownership of the internet by the collective rather than the few is and always will be a key part of what we’re all doing here. Still, why do 95% of consumers know what crypto is but only 22% actively use anything that constitutes a “crypto application?” How do we reach an age in which Dapps are just apps and in which web3 is just “the internet?”</p>
<p>How do we unify the world under one banner?</p>
<p>To even begin to answer any of these questions, we need to both understand why we haven’t quite crossed the chasm. We’ve redefined what the financial system and, the internet as a whole can be, but we haven’t gotten the greater global population to buy in.</p>
<p>By looking at how different projects, networks, and platforms, both in and outside of crypto, have overcome the "cold start problem," you can piece together a playbook to set your Dapp up to cross the chasm to widespread adoption.</p>
<p>For our purposes, we’ll be examining all cases under the umbrella of platforms, since almost every popular app, Dapp, or network today has turned out to be one.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-the-cold-start-problem-and-why-should-anyone-care">What is the Cold Start Problem and why should anyone care?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/cold-start-solutions-scaling-consumer-crypto#what-is-the-cold-start-problem-and-why-should-anyone-care" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the Cold Start Problem and why should anyone care?" title="Direct link to What is the Cold Start Problem and why should anyone care?">​</a></h3>
<p>You’ve built an app. You believe it’s the next place where everyone will gather to connect and share content online. It’s going to be the next member of the “billion users club.”</p>
<p>Everything’s in place technically and yet, there’s one problem. You don’t have any users and you don’t have anything for them to share.</p>
<p>If you’ve built an Airbnb without listings and users, a YouTube without videos, or a social network without content and users, then you’ve faced the cold start problem. Trying to figure out how to set the right baseline of producers(or just content) and consumers to set your app(or platform) up for success means solving the cold start problem.</p>
<p>In the context of web3, a cold start refers to launching a Dapp that has no user base yet. Alternatively, it can be defined as determining how to attract an initial user base that will engage with the Dapp in the exact ways needed to scale it from 0 to a wide audience.</p>
<p>Knowing how to address the cold start problem requires understanding how others have already done so and there’s no better place to begin than with some of web2’s most explosive successes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="zoom-its-easy-and-it-just-works">Zoom: It’s easy and it just works<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/cold-start-solutions-scaling-consumer-crypto#zoom-its-easy-and-it-just-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Zoom: It’s easy and it just works" title="Direct link to Zoom: It’s easy and it just works">​</a></h3>
<p>There’s something to be said for a product that’s dedicated to being as reliable as possible and as easy as possible to use. When Zoom rose to prominence during the pandemic, some claimed that its meteoric growth was simply due to luck and timing.</p>
<p>This, however, is only half of the truth.</p>
<p>They had both the right timing and the right product.</p>
<p>On the surface, Zoom appeared to be just another videoconferencing option, but two key actors prepared it to become the giant it is today. First, it was and continues to be dedicated to making every aspect of the user experience radically simple. You could and can still join a meeting just by clicking a link. Everything from reacting to a speaker to sending a message to changing your background, to integrating your planned meetings with your calendar was made as easy as possible to do.</p>
<p>During a time when we were more desperate than ever to connect with people, it became the most reliable option. The fact that it continued to run nearly seamlessly for up to 100 users per meeting via the free tier and 300+ on the higher tiers only added to its popularity.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll find Zoom’s example to be inspiring and perhaps not. Admittedly, Zoom has now also faced its share of issues. Even so, web3 builders can still learn from its team’s dedication to facilitating seamless onboarding and making the product “just work” above all else.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways from Zoom’s example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the number of signatures required for sign-up to your Dapp</li>
<li>Simplifying the process of initiating transactions</li>
<li>Integrating solutions similar to <a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push’s Cross Chain Requests</a> to take the hassle of bridging and related actions away from the end-user</li>
<li>Stripping away complexity that could cause performance issues in the early days and focusing on the core functionalities that are explicitly needed</li>
<li>Beta testing, through multiple iterations in a gamified fashion with points or even tokens to ensure your MVP just works</li>
<li>Releasing your MVP once it’s clear it will run without major issues</li>
<li>Adding new features with direct user input through community calls, surveys, and other direct methods like the governance process, as your Dapp’s user base grows</li>
</ul>
<p>With a list such as the above, you’ll be off to a good start. Still, having a killer product is only one piece of the puzzle. Solving the cold start problem also means having the right mix of users in place, or, as Alexis Ohanian puts it, “the minimum viable community,” from day one.</p>

<p>To define “minimum viable community,” and why it matters, let’s begin by considering the invention of the consumer credit card. On September 18, 1958, Bank of America mailed the first credit cards to 60,000 residents of Fresno, California. These cards were pre-loaded with $300-$500 of credit and required no application process.</p>
<p>In one day, 60,000 cardholders came into being. This resulted in 300 Fresno-based merchants signing up to support Bank of America’s new network. In just over a year, that network grew to 2 million cardholders and 20,000 merchants.</p>
<p>Bank of America’s gamble worked because it wasn’t a gamble. Their first cardholders weren’t randomly selected. At the time of the launch, 45% of Fresno residents had some sort of relationship with the bank, making Fresno the ideal spot for the first atomic network for their new credit card.</p>
<p>With their experience with Fresno in hand, the bank was able to repeat the same success repeatedly leading to their meteoric rise to prominence in the nascent space of consumer credit.</p>
<p>This is an atomic network, a unique, intentional matching of consumers and producers that just works and can be repeated to scale a networked product.</p>
<p>All successful platforms started in this manner. Still, the atomic network is only one part of the battle. Without a killer product to drive to it, your chances of scaling are virtually non-existent.</p>
<p>Take Bitcoin, for example.</p>
<p>In 2009, when it launched, it already had pre-set users. The cypherpunk community. These individuals believed in widespread financial freedom, the right to privacy, and every other aspect of what is still the wind beneath the wings of the crypto industry. With the cypherpunks as its first atomic network, Bitcoin launched and continued to scale without a central authority.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways from Bank of America and Bitcoin itself:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting with a specific area or online community where people need what you're offering</li>
<li>Zeroing in on that using similar approaches to how Bank of America built out its credit network and how Bitcoin built out its initial atomic network for future scale</li>
<li>Making sure your product addresses a need expressed in the values of the group or groups involved</li>
<li>Determining through your initial connection with that group or groups what features address a real need for them</li>
<li>Launching with a small set of features that directly address what this initial atomic network or MVC needs</li>
<li>Iterating and expanding based on user feedback and direct usage patterns that arise in your MVC</li>
<li>Using your initial atomic network or MVC as a model for growth into new markets and leveraging the same messaging and overall values that attracted your pioneers</li>
</ul>
<p>Killer products with the right atomic networks can set a Dapp up for explosive growth but you won’t gain and retain your initial atomic network without solving for the power users first.</p>
<p>Whether we’re speaking about a web2 app like Zoom or Bitcoin, the digital gold itself, the principle remains the same.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="wikipedia-ethereum-and-daos-solve-for-the-core-contributors-first">Wikipedia, Ethereum, and DAOs: Solve for the Core Contributors First<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-911/blog/cold-start-solutions-scaling-consumer-crypto#wikipedia-ethereum-and-daos-solve-for-the-core-contributors-first" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wikipedia, Ethereum, and DAOs: Solve for the Core Contributors First" title="Direct link to Wikipedia, Ethereum, and DAOs: Solve for the Core Contributors First">​</a></h3>
<p>Last but not least, let’s say you have a killer, easy-to-use product and a potential atomic network, but you’re struggling with attracting your first creators.</p>
<p>“Creator,” in this context, may be considered synonymous with “producer.”  Youtubers, Bitcoin miners, developers, or even Wikipedia editors, it’s all the same in this respect. In today’s day and age where we’re trending more and more towards every app involving a two-sided exchange, it’s never been more crucial to attract and retain the right creators from the get-go.</p>
<p>For instance, Wikipedia is largely maintained by 0.02% of its users, who create and edit articles for free. They do so both because they deeply connect with Wikipedia’s vision of “free access to all human knowledge,” and because of the relative prestige their work gains them within their community.</p>
<p>In short, they join the effort and stay with it because they need to see the vision realized. DAOs work in the same manner. So do many crypto projects, including Ethereum itself which has consistently been able to attract and retain builders from all over the world due to its commitment to being the world computer that anyone can build on.</p>
<p>The vision rules. The core contributors create the environment for ideal collaboration which scales the network to new heights.</p>
<p>Wikipedia found its core contributors through sharing its vision across communities that were most likely to resonate with it, like Nupedia, and Slashdot. DAOs tend to publish manifestos, constitutions, or similar documents from day one to do the same. Ethereum used its early technical papers and its ICO, together with memorable appearances at industry events, as jump-off points.</p>
<p>In all of these cases, the founding teams led with incredible attention to detail related to who their initial target market was.</p>
<p>Still, creating an environment that incentivizes consistent growth is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>Some Dapps will choose to start by surveying their core community and creating a shared vision and set of values as a collective. Some will do so via a delegation representing the whole community. Others won’t need decentralized governance of any kind until the later stages of their development.</p>
<p>While there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to attracting and keeping the first producers or “core contributors” to your Dapp’s growth, there are principles that tend to work across the board.</p>
<p>The below is an attempt at mapping out the steps of that effort.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways from Wikipedia, Ethereum, and DAOs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an impactful vision and using successful vision-driven projects as jump-offs or inspirations for doing so</li>
<li>Aligning your project's vision with the values of your most active users</li>
<li>Publishing a manifesto or a similar document indicating what you stand for and why people should care about what you are doing</li>
<li>Creating an environment that fosters collaboration and innovation</li>
<li>Implementing governance structures and incentives that encourage long-term commitment</li>
<li>Ensuring that any change or new effort you put into place is a value add for your core contributors</li>
<li>Making paths to further growth clear to every community member, whether that’s how an ambassador rises to core status or something else entirely</li>
<li>Opening up growth paths to anyone and having them stewarded by your initial core members</li>
<li>Iterating with community sentiment and realizing that no aspect of your community, even your initial vision, is set in stone forever</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re at a tipping point.</p>
<p>Both in and outside of the crypto space, almost all popular apps are platforms. Some sort of supplier is meeting some sort of demand. The rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the industry we hold dear today shifted everything further towards this point. Today, crypto-based applications are starting to break through to the mainstream, but we haven’t yet had our breakout moment.</p>
<p>For now, we’re still sitting on the edge of the chasm towards widespread consumer usage.</p>
<p>To make our way across, we need the right playbook for scaling Dapps which focuses on simplicity reigning across the user experience, growth beginning and consistently centering on the atomic network, and the hard side being solved from the earliest days.</p>
<p>Our discussion here today is an in-roads. How you address the cold start problem is highly context-specific to what your Dapp’s niche is. With all of the above takeaways at your fingertips, you have the foundation for an early-growth playbook that gets you off to a solid start.</p>
<p>As you think about any of the areas that we’ve covered here, consider the following questions to help guide you even further:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can you abstract away complexity from your networked product to make the user experience as easy as possible from day one?</li>
<li>What's the deep purpose of the network you're launching?</li>
<li>Why should people care about that purpose?</li>
<li>Who are the groups in which you’ll find those people who will become your minimum viable community?</li>
<li>Where do those groups gather, online or offline?</li>
<li>How can you most effectively reach them in a way that won’t turn them off from what you’re offering?</li>
<li>Once you’ve got your minimum viable community, what will keep them involved?</li>
<li>What incentives will you offer to show in practice that you’re dedicated to your earliest users?</li>
<li>How will you take in community feedback and how will you show you’re using it in practice?</li>
<li>How will your product be led over time?</li>
<li>Will you DAOify or simply decentralize a part of your product?</li>
</ul>
<p>We, at Push, envision a world in which the on-chain experience is seamless and Universal Apps negate the need to understand the complexity of switching between chains. For that to happen, we need all hands working together towards the same goal.
