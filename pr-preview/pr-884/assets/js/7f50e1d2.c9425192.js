Although public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have had a rise in popularity since 2017, blockchain technology is not limited to cryptocurrency and nor is it limited to a public blockchain.

Every system and process is decentralized, from the fleet of autonomous vehicles, to even the election of the government! All with help of the primary infrastructure of communication that they proudly use, EPNS! Your electric vehicle is low on charge? Get notified, and you get to decide whether to redirect to the closest charging station or take your chance and get back home where you already have one set up. Major news to be announced by media and news outlets? EPNS delivers it right to the fingertips of Blockville citizens, and the best part about all of this? Blockville citizens not only receive notifications but earn passive income from these notifications targeted at them. Are elections going on? Use EPNS to signal or vote using on-chain governance voting and even get the chance to predict the outcome of these city mayoral elections with the help of decentralized prediction markets!"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Within this fantastic and revolutionary city, there are multiple citizens going about their daily lives.

As he makes way into the airport, John receives an EPNS notification that the flight is canceled due to unpredictable weather conditions. Disappointed, John begins to head to the information desk to know what to do next. But soon he starts receiving EPNS notifications from the Airline he booked his flight with. It mentioned that the next flight to his destination is 8 hours away and that he is more than welcome to avail the complimentary lounge accommodation that the airline was willing to give to all passengers who missed the flight, and his insurance company had also notified him that some of the money which he had used to buy his ticket will be reimbursed to his wallet. John had fortunately signed up for the flight insurance package when he booked his tickets online hence, he was eligible to avail these benefits. John is relieved, and the notifications that were sent to him created no room for any doubt as he was able to now plan how to handle the crisis.

Kevin is in his mid-50s, and has not been feeling too well these days, he fears that he must have contracted something and wants to visit a doctor. But he is currently in another part of the city where he is visiting his son for the upcoming holidays and is away from his home. But it\u2019s okay since all Hospitals and Healthcare centers in Blockville are in a consortium and are connected to the blockchain, he can use a dApp to schedule his appointment with a doctor in the nearest hospital and use his SSI (Self Sovereign Identity). As his appointment is confirmed, Kevin gets notified about it directly in his wallet and he receives a \u201crequest of transfer\u201d of his EHR (Electronic Health Records) from the Hospital he booked an appointment with via EPNS, which he approves by signing it with his SSI credentials and approves the doctor who he is meeting with to have access to his medical history and prescriptions. He takes this moment to even acknowledge the simplicity and need for such use-cases of Health Records with blockchain. He remembers reading that before Blockville\u2019s EHR blockchain innovation statistics showed that up to 1 in 5 patient records are not accurately matched even within the same health care system. As many as half of the patient records are mismatched when data is transferred between healthcare systems. He relishes and appreciates how far technology has improved especially in Blockville, no wonder he loves staying here. As Kevin is taken aback by all these thoughts, he loses track of time.

He meets the doctor again who prescribes him some medicines and drugs to be taken in a timely manner, and informs him about his condition, Kevin doesn;t have much to worry about, just a few days of antibiotics will do the trick for him and it isn\u2019t that serious. The news was a relief to Kevin as he presumed something bad had happened to him. The doctor updates Kevin\u2019s EHR and pushes it back into the blockchain, all the information is encrypted (even the notifications) so Kevin doesn\u2019t have to worry about his privacy.
