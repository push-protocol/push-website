And not just us, for the entire crypto space. It was the year when the world finally opened up to crypto, blockchain, DeFi, and all their use cases. Along with the fundamental changes also arrived the age of L2 scaling and NFTs, pushing blockchain and crypto further into the mainstream.\\n\\nAlongside all the massive developments that the crypto space accomplished altogether, EPNS too has been growing at a rapid pace. From our Token Generation Event giving birth to our native token $PUSH to hitting important milestones, to say 2021 was a thrilling year would be a massive understatement. Some major milestones we reached include protocol audit, Community Incentives Programs, the EPNS Governance launch, community growth with EPNS Rockstars, mobile app launch, SDKs, the EPNS browser extension release, and project collaborations with some of the most renowned protocols in the space!\\n\\nThat being said, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without our super supportive community that kept pushing us for the best in us. We are humbled by the love and support that we have received from the EPNS and wider Ethereum community. We love you all. A HUGE Kudos to the EPNS team as well for working tirelessly day in and day out to make EPNS the truly robust, reliant, and decentralized communication protocol for Web3.\\n\\nWelcome to the EPNS 2021 Rewind, where we summarize our journey and highlights in the past year, reminiscing how much we\u2019ve grown as a project.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f And then it Began \u2014 The $PUSH Token Genesis \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\n- Token Generation Event\\n- Liquidity mining\\n- Airdrop to our early adopters and community members\\n\\nAs the year kicked off, EPNS took huge steps. It all started with a genesis \u2014 the Token Generation Event of $PUSH. It was no mean feat! It was the culmination of months of hard work combined with thorough discussions and feedback from members of the community, advisors and investors regarding the overall tokenomics of $PUSH. The token generation was followed by the initiation of the [Liquidity Rewards Program](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-liquidity-rewards-program-d16ff2c0fef4). The Rewards program launched with two pools: The PUSH Staking Pool and the Uniswap LP Pool, allowing users to participate in yield farming and liquidity mining opportunities with $PUSH.\\n\\nOver the months that followed the TGE, $PUSH got listed on highly popular crypto exchanges like Huobi, KuCoin, Uniswap, ParaSwap, WazirX, MEXC, ZebPay, Gate.io, Bitbns.\\n\\nThis truly was an exciting time for the team, and so was it for the community as it marked the beginning of EPNS\u2019s push (pun totally intended) to become the world\u2019s first decentralized notifications & Web3 communication protocol.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f Frens Coming Together \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nAs we built the world\u2019s first decentralized web3 notifications and communications protocol, we realized that it was time to put EPNS to heavy testing and start onboarding more participants to the protocol! So, we partnered with numerous decentralized protocols to start working with them as part of our pilot program and implementing channels for their various use cases. The pilot program gradually grew into something we did not imagine. By the end of 2021, we were working with a number of household DeFi and Web3 projects joining the list. We are super excited to be able to integrate EPNS with our fellow partners and thrilled to be working with some of the best minds in the industry and bringing push notifications for their users.\\n\\n<iframe

Building a community is one thing, building the tech to deliver our promise for a decentralized web3 notifications protocol is another. In the past months, we\u2019ve followed our Roadmap carefully and executed sequentially to eventually lead up to our soon-to-come Mainnet launch!\\n\\n![First Image of Our 2021 Year in Review \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nIn Q1, while our main focus was to get prepared and successfully complete our Smart Contracts Audit and everything surrounding the Token Generation Event, we also made great improvements in our frontends and worked on providing tooling for developers to start experimenting with the protocol. By the end of Q1, we ended up by successfully launching our token together with our incentives website and our ROCKSTARS of EPNS NFTs initiative for the community to participate.\\n\\nDuring Q2, a lot of our efforts were towards establishing collaborations with some of the most important protocols in the space. We started working on our strategic pilot partnerships and collabs with some of the major Defi protocols and communities in the ecosystem, these include Uniswap, AAVE, Alpha Homora, TrueFi, Gitcoin, Polygon, Superfluid, Biconomy, and much much more!\\n\\nQ2 also saw the release of the EPNS browser extension (allowing you to receive notifications on your browser as well), [SDK Beta v1.0 releases](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework-and-backend-sdk-beta-v1-0-are-live-7348c0725a12) for the Showrunners SDK & Backend SDKs with example dApps for you developers to test us out!\\n\\nQ3 saw MAJOR leaps and changes in how EPNS is designed and progressed as a protocol. It was time that EPNS looked to be future-proof and ready for a multi-chain world. The EPNS Protocol was now divided into EPNS Core Protocol and EPNS Communicator Protocol. The Core protocol is deployed only on Ethereum while the Communicator Protocol would be deployed on multiple chains, allowing for multi-chain functionality. Going multi-chain also meant that we needed to change how user incentives were designed, the details of which you can [read here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/roadmap-q3-audited-epns-push-protocol-v1-is-here-f4560dfe550c).\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe id=\\"player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" title=\\"Breakpoint 2021: Surf\'s Up: Demos from the Solana Ecosystem (Day 2)\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\" }}  src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eY9uxsJtfYQ?wmode=opaque&amp;start=9&amp;widget_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fpush-protocol%2Four-2021-year-in-review-8193ddbab4d8&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com&amp;widgetid=1\\"></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\nQ3 also included the official [launch of EPNS Governance](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-governance-goes-live-lets-push-for-progressive-decentralized-governance-7448b58b89b4), marking the first step to progressively decentralizing the EPNS Protocol among $PUSH holders.\\n\\nFurther, the Protocol contracts were also audited by [Chainsafe](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1452640272475574277?s=20) during this Q3!\\n\\nWe were also able to achieve the launch of the alpha of [PUSH Nodes](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-nodes-p2p-web3s-way-to-communicate-6a473577d173) which would enable communication across Ethereum, L2s, and even other EVM and non-EVM L1s!\\n\\nIt was in the same quarter that we also started working on EPIPs (Ethereum Push Improvement Proposals) as a means to allow users to propose changes to and vote on proposals related to EPNS.\\n\\nAs the year started coming to a close in Q4, our complete focus shifted on preparing EPNS for its upcoming Mainnet launch in early January 2022.\\n\\nThis quarter saw us adding some much needed protocol feature updates such as a spam box for indirect subscriptions, delegation of channel controls, and verification badges on frontend. Along with this came our successful implementation of meta transactions for \u201csubscribe/unsubscribe\u201d actions, as well as for sending notifications themselves! This represents a huge step forward in terms of user experience as users wanting to opt-in to receive notifications will now just need to sign an off-chain transaction.\\n\\nThe staging environment, PUSH Mobile App and PUSH Nodes were migrated to Kovan Testnet, allowing us to ensure that our migration scripts are rock solid, and assuring us that we were taking all the necessary precautions in our preparation for the big day!\\n\\n2021 was a busy year, and we\u2019re proud to have achieved the vast majority of our product and community milestones. To always remain transparent, it\u2019s important to note that the third party mobile SDK, P2P Push Nodes incentives, and Ceramic DID integration milestones were postponed so we could prioritize making EPNS multi-chain compatible ahead of mainnet launch. In our upcoming 2022 Roadmap, we are brainstorming the best implementation cycle for these features.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f Rocking the world with EPNS Rockstars \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\n- NFTs and Rockstars\\n- Community contributions: from beautiful artwork, development guides, articles and more!\\n  At EPNS, we realized that we are nothing without the backing of our wonderful community. In order to show our gratitude to our most passionate and vibrant supporters, we launched the EPNS ROCKSTARS NFT Collection. Every week, a member from the community is chosen (currently via [Governance](https://gov.epns.io/)) to be awarded that week\u2019s ROCKSTAR NFT and by extension be crowned as that week\u2019s EPNS Rockstar! And that\u2019s not all, every ROCKSTAR receives a bag of 2400 $PUSH along with their prestigious NFT!\\n\\nOver the course of this year we have chosen 35 EPNS Rockstars, and we are at a loss for words for the sheer dedication, love, and support this community has shown us while participating in this program!\\n\\n![Second Image of Our 2021 Year in Review \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nFrom community education through articles, development guides, and simple explainers, to EPNS-themed artworks, memes, and videos; this community showed us that they really are our Rockstars!\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f Power to the People \u2014 Governance Launch \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\n<img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"bg kq lw c\\" width=\\"700\\" height=\\"394\\" loading=\\"eager\\" role=\\"presentation\\" src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*S2xhUAhgf5IrLEDG\\" ></img>\\n\\nIn September, we launched EPNS Governance, as a push for progressive decentralization of the EPNS protocol among the community. It was time for the $PUSH community to take charge by delegating their votes! The Governance framework launched with three ways for the community to vote and be involved: 1) Weekly Rockstar NFT, 2) Grants Program and 3) Metagovernance.\\n\\nThe Governance framework laid out the rules, processes, and roles of governance by the community during Phase 0 of the progressive decentralization plan for EPNS. This ensured that there was a clear groundwork for the community to coordinate to make better decisions. In the first iteration of the governance mechanism we use Snapshot, a multi-chain gasless client for decentralized voting. Due to its Snapshot-based implementation, the voting mechanism shall be weighted based on the number of $PUSH tokens delegated to the voting address. Hereafter, any potential modifications to the protocol must pass through a proposal and voting process.\\n\\nOver the past few months, we saw a steady increase in the number of participants and delegates in governance. The governance forum has been gaining traction to propose and discuss proposals. The increasing involvement of community members within the forum\u2019s General Discussion, and also during the Snapshot voting of the weekly EPNS Rockstar has helped us slowly achieve the progressive decentralization we aimed for when we launched the EPNS Governance.\\n\\nLearn more about how EPNS Governance works [here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-governance-goes-live-lets-push-for-progressive-decentralized-governance-7448b58b89b4).\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f Giving Back through Retroactive Public Goods Funding \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nWhat started as a small but ambitious project in Gitcoin Grants Round 7 ended up as a top 5 project in the round with 210 contributors, and has grown today to be a sponsor for the past two Grants Rounds this year!\\n\\nSo, now, with all the love and support we\u2019ve been receiving from you amazing folks in our community. it was time for us to give back to the Web3 community by sponsoring Gitcoin Grants Rounds 11, & 12!\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1471163142960934912&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"790\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"EPNS | $PUSH - We\'re hiring! on Twitter: &quot;EPNS is sponsoring @gitcoin Grants Round 12 - GR12 \ud83d\udcabStarted as a Grantee, &amp; now here we are as a Grantor \u23e9As we look back, we\'re incredibly excited to help early projects the same way we were helped back in our early days \u2728A glimpse into GR12 \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/3PHO64kvIM / Twitter&quot;\\" class=\\"eh n ei tm bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\n\\n<div class=\\"ab ca\\"><div class=\\"ch bg dx dy dz ea\\"><h2 id=\\"4ba4\\" class=\\"nd ne ev be nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn mi no np nq mm nr ns nt mq nu nv nw nx bj\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\"\\">\ud83c\udf1f Conferences, Talks, AMAs\u2026Events Galore!!! \ud83c\udf1f</h2><p id=\\"5580\\" class=\\"pw-post-body-paragraph lx ly ev lz b ma ny mc md me nz mg mh mi oa mk ml mm ob mo mp mq oc ms mt mu eo bj\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\"\\">2021 had no shortage of events within the crypto and web3 community.

The past year was an inspiring one with EPNS accomplishing and expanding beyond imagination. We worked hard to ensure EPNS is cross-chain ready! And we even had the opportunity to put a POC ready during the Solana Breakpoint event! We expanded our team and integrated with multiple major protocols and projects within the ecosystem, and continue to have the backing of the most amazing community we\u2019ve seen!\\n\\n2022 marks a new beginning, it\u2019s now time for EPNS to go big. We have big plans for the upcoming year \u2014 Mainnet launch, grants program and more!\\n\\nThe EPNS mainnet launches on January 11, 2022. With it, applications across Web3 will begin exploring what it means to communicate with each other and with their users in a decentralized, permissionless, and incentivized way.\\n\\nWith the launch of our mainnet, businesses, service providers, and dApps in Web3 will officially be able to create channels to communicate with their own communities. The utilities are nearly limitless. DeFi applications can set up notifications that are triggered with on-chain information like loan liquidations and governance proposals. Good samaritans can set up channels to notify their subscribers about airdrops, or when suspicious activity could portent security issues. Centralized exchanges can notify people when new tokens are launched. All of this happens with just a click of a button, putting so much more power into the hands of the everyday Web3 user.\\n\\nIt\u2019s an ambitious year to look forward. But as all good things, we move\u2026forward.\\n\\nLet\u2019s #PUSH for Web3 Notifs, and Have a rocking 2022 \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96"}}')}}]);
