Push Nodes are the nodes responsible for validating notification and chat payload and for dispatching notifications to addresses. Push Nodes can have different roles in this Communication Network.\\nThe vision for Push Protocol is for the Push Nodes to be run by the community and to get rewarded by contributing to the network\'s decentralization. As of today, Push Nodes are run by Push Protocol, but the team is working on decentralizing the nodes.\\nAlthough the Push Nodes are run by Push Protocol, users can always verify that the chat messages and notifications haven\u2019t been tampered with and that they have indeed been sent by the correct address. Users can always verify this by the Verification Proof.\\n\\nHead over to the [Galxe](https://galxe.com/JDGNdt7oWLFDeUUUVgdNmb/campaign/GCsdpt4Jjk) quest page now and embark on your journey."}}')}}]);
