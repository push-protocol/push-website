With a strong emphasis on collaboration, freedom, and monetization, SOCLLY provides a dynamic platform where creators can thrive and connect with their audience on their own terms.\\n\\nNow partnering with Push, SOCLLY is taking its user experience to new heights, enhancing its offerings and delivering a seamless experience for creators and users alike. This collaboration empowers SOCLLY to incorporate robust chat functionalities. In turn enabling real-time dialogue and engagement.\\n\\nBut that\u2019s only the beginning. With the foundation set, SOCLLY and Push Chat are set to unleash a wave of future developments that will reshape the way we interact and communicate. It\u2019s time to connect, collaborate, and unleash your creativity like never before in web3.\\n\\nIn conversation with co-founders Prayag and Naresh, we talk about the problem SOCLLY solves, their vision, and the integration of Push Chat. Prayag and Naresh and absolutely thrilled about the future use cases that Push Chat will bring to the platform, calling it a potential game-changer in web3 communication.\\n\\n### 1. Hi Prayag and Naresh, what\u2019s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\\n\\nI am Prayag Singh, one of the co-founders at SOCLLY. My professional journey began in earnest in 2016, post-graduation, when I embraced the role of an automation engineer for two years. In 2018, the intriguing world of blockchain technology came to my attention through Bitcoin, sparking the onset of an exciting new phase in my career.\\n\\nAs I delved into the nuances of the Bitcoin whitepaper, I found myself captivated by the potential and implications of the technology. I was already acquainted with the concept of a peer-to-peer network through Torrent. Still, I hadn\u2019t realized until then the transformative potential of this technology in revolutionizing the financial sector and its aptitude for facilitating global payments.\\n\\nFuelled by this newfound understanding and enthusiasm, I actively participated in meetups to enhance my knowledge and understanding of this revolutionary technology. This and my prior professional experience eventually led me to devote myself fully to the web3 domain. In the latter part of 2018, I was fortunate enough to become part of Bloque Labs. I had the unique opportunity to contribute to various products and further my skills here. I was involved in writing smart contracts in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain and also gained experience with private blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric.\\n\\nAs the year 2021 commenced, my co-founder and I were driven by a desire to address the significant challenges faced by creators and educators in the web3 space, which led to the inception of what we now refer to as the SOCLLY journey. We actively engaged with creators, discussing the obstacles they encountered in establishing meaningful connections with their audiences. Their feedback was invaluable, shaping the creation of our MVP to cater specifically to their needs.\\n\\nFollowing a continuous cycle of feedback and refinement, and a dedicated effort spanning a year and a half, SOCLLY finally came to life. Presently, my complete dedication and commitment are focused on the further development and growth of SOCLLY, fuelled by a steadfast belief in its potential to make a positive impact in the web3 space.\\n\\nMy name is Naresh Katta, and I proudly serve as a co-founder of SOCLLY. I bring over nine years of experience in Java and Android development to the table, and in 2017, I enthusiastically embraced the world of blockchain technology. The subsequent five years have seen me sharpening my abilities in crafting Solidity smart contracts and delving deeply into the capabilities of Ethereum.\\n\\nIn 2018, I had the good fortune to join the team at BloqueLabs. There, my responsibilities included the development of backend solutions utilizing Solidity for various blockchain-based products. As the global community confronted the ramifications of the first wave of the COVID pandemic, my co-founders and I were inspired to take action to ease the burdens of creators and educators in the web3 realm.\\n\\nThis inspiration was the fruit of numerous conversations with creators and educators at both virtual and physical meetups, leading us to the concept of SOCLLY. We envisioned a platform that could empower web3-native creators and educators by allowing them to receive payments in stable coins for their offerings, with an uncompromising commitment to privacy and security.\\n\\nOur team spent one and a half years meticulously crafting SOCLLY, and we eagerly await the opportunity to see its transformative effect on the web3 community.\\n\\n### 2.
