We approached the EF with our idea for a communication and notification layer of Web3, leading to tons of research \ud83d\udd2c\\n\\nThat led us to HackMoney 2020 with [ETHGlobal](https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal) and the EPNS proof of concept was created! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc\\n\\nNext up, we were selected for [IDEO Collab Ventures](https://twitter.com/IDEOVC) **Product Validation Day** in June 2020. Along with other Web3 projects, EPNS was selected out of 120+ teams to share the project for feedback, discussion, and iteration.\\n\\nAnd just a few weeks later, EPNS was honored to have been selected for [Gitcoin KERNEL](https://twitter.com/KERNEL0x) (Genesis Block). We embarked on a 8 week journey of collaborating, testing, building, and iterating with leaders from across the Web3. Eight weeks later, we came out in the top 20 projects from KERNEL\ud83d\ude0e.\\n\\nNext in line: **Gitcoin Grants Round 7!** We couldn\u2019t have imagined the support and enthusiasm from the Gitcoin and wider Ethereum community. We ended the round in the top 5 projects, with over 210 contributors!\\n\\nThis successful Gitcoin Grants round participation led us to [announce our seed in December!](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ethereum-push-notification-service-successfully-raises-750k-usd-in-seed-round-bec41eadd84d) **$750k** in funding from [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis), [Scott Moore](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore), [DefiDad](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad), [Anthony Sassano](https://twitter.com/sassal0x), and many more!\\n\\nBut our journey with Gitcoin didn\u2019t stop there! After the **$PUSH** token launch, we announced the \ud83c\udfb8[Rockstars of Ethereum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nClMGshU1nU&list=PLyWTqFLqKt9Z_tlTGz29qcP36VqLjo3nu) series. Our inaugural episode was with none other than [**Kevin Owocki**](https://twitter.com/owocki) himself!\\n\\n![First Image of EPNS \ud83d\udc95 Gitcoin](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nJust a month later, we announced our [**partnership with Gitcoin**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1388131533735661573?s=20). The partnership builds on the EPNS platform to allow notifications for the grant process, better connecting grantees to grantors.\\n\\nAnd today, we\u2019re excited to announce our **Sponsorship of Gitcoin Grants Round 11!** \ud83c\udf89We\u2019re psyched to see all the emerging projects and give our support to projects in the space that are at the stage we were at just a year ago.\\n\\nOur journey from grantee to grantor \u201ccompletes the circle\u201d of our journey with [Gitcoin](https://twitter.com/gitcoin), but it doesn\u2019t mark the end! We look forward to continuing to support and give back to the community that has given us so much.\\n\\nThank you Gitcoin! \ud83d\udc9d"}}')}}]);
