Today, the launch of the token-gated Group Chat on the UD messaging platform is another step towards decentralized, open, censorship-resistant communication for the future of the web. At launch, UD Group messaging will go live with <b>400+ Groups, for 3.8M+ UD users</b>.\\n\\n### Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication\\n\\nCurrently, UD\u2019s messaging interface [Unstoppable Messaging](https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/categories/announcements/article/messaging-launch) allows any web3 user to message addresses belonging to a .eth, .x, .crypto domain, .polygon along with many other domains. However, Unstoppable Messaging has been limited to just one-to-one and one-to-many messaging. As such, we\u2019ve been working with Unstoppable Domains to enable a robust, token-gated system through badges, allowing anyone with a [badge](https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001215751-badges) to join a Group Chat and start a conversation.\\n\\nBy blending UD\u2019s expertise in web3 domain services with Push Protocol\u2019s market-leading decentralized messaging technology, we\u2019re excited to release this all-new feature to the web3 community.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n    <i>\\n    \u201cOur partnership with Unstoppable is not merely about changing the way teams communicate; it\'s about revolutionizing it. \'Group Chat\' embodies our dedication to empowering organizations with cutting-edge communication technology.\\" \\n    </i>\\n    <b>\u2014 Harsh Rajat, Founder at Push Protocol</b>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n### What Are Token Gated Group Chats\\n\\nToken-gated Group Chats are exactly what their name implies, Group Chats that require you to hold a specific token (NFT or crypto-asset) to either access any given group, or message within it. Token-gating your Group Chats is a surefire way of controlling who can enter your chats and who can message within them. As the admin of your Group Chat, you can set and adjust permissions whenever you like.\\n\\nFor businesses, organizations, and teams, it\u2019s a fantastic way to ensure your communication channels remain private and secure by giving you total control over who enters and participates in the communication channel.\\n\\nYou can learn more about [Token-Gated/Conditional Group Chats here](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/build/conditional-rules-for-group/).\\n\\n### Getting Started With UD Group Chat\\n\\nGetting started with Push Protocol x Unstoppable Domains Group Chat is simple \u2014 you either need to join an existing Group Chat or create your own.\\n\\nEvery Group Chat is associated with a \u2018[badge](https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001215751-badges)\u2019 and hence token-gated based on badge ownership.\\n\\nAt launch, every UD badge that exists will have its own Group Chat (currently 400+ Group Chats are live). If you\u2019re a holder of those badges, you\u2019ll be eligible to join those groups.\\n\\n- To join a Group Chat for a badge you own:\\n\\n1. Go to Unstoppable Messaging from your [ud.me](https://ud.me/) Profile ([Learn More](https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001244742-unstoppable-messaging)).\\n2.

Find the community you would like to begin chatting with and select <b>Join group chat</b>.\\n   ![Image of Announcing \u201cGroup Chat\u201d from Push Protocol and Unstoppable Domains ](./image-2.webp)\\n4. You\u2019re done! You will be able to join the text-based chat going forward.\\n\\n- To create a new Group Chat with Sponsored Badges:\\n\\n1. [Create a Sponsored Badge](https://unstoppabledomains.com/badge/activate) by entering the <b>URL to your NFT collection</b>\\n2. Distribute your NFT to your community or team members\\n3. That\u2019s it!
