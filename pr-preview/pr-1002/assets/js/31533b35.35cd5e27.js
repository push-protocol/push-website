Using the SDK, developers can:\\n\\n- Build PUSH features into their dapps\\n- Get access to Push Nodes APIs\\n- Render Push Notifications UI\\n\\nIt is written in Typescript and supports React, React Native, Plain JS, and Node JS-based platforms. (We are adding support for more!) It is also built on top of standard Web3 packages like <b>ethers, @web3-react</b>.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re looking for our full documentation on [Push-SDK REST API, you can find that here](https://comms.push.org/docs).\\n\\nBut for now, let\u2019s walk you through the main features of the Push-SDK REST API and how to use them in your code.\\n\\n## Fetching user notifications\\n\\nYou can use the <b>getFeeds</b> method to fetch a user\'s notifications. This method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\\n\\n- <b>user</b> (mandatory, string): The user\u2019s address in CAIP format.\\n- <b>page</b> (optional, number): The page index of the results. Default is 1.\\n- <b>limit</b> (optional, number): The number of items per page. Default is 10.\\n- <b>spam</b> (optional, boolean): Whether to fetch spam notifications. Default is false.\\n- <b>env</b> (optional, string): The API environment to use. Possible values are \u2018prod\u2019 and \u2018staging\u2019. Default is \u2018prod\u2019.\\n- <b>raw</b> (optional, boolean): Whether to return the raw, unformatted API response. Default is <b>false</b>.\\n\\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might use the <b>getFeeds</b> method in your code:\\n\\n```js\\nconst notifications = await PushAPI.user.getFeeds({\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we define a user address using the CAIP format. CAIP, or Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal, is a way to describe standards for blockchain projects that are not specific to a single chain. It was developed by the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process and is used to identify and encode information about Ethereum addresses, contract addresses, and other crypto-assets.\\n\\nIt is important to note that CAIP is not a standardized way of identifying and encoding information about crypto-assets; it is under development by the Ethereum community and is not yet widely adopted in the ecosystem.\\n\\nCAIP addresses are composed of three parts:\\n\\n- <b>The namespace:</b> This is a string designed to uniquely identify a blockchain ecosystem or set of ecosystems as a namespace.\\n- <b>The network ID:</b> This is an integer that identifies the Ethereum network the asset belongs to. For example, 1 is the main network, 3 is the Ropsten test network, 5 is the Goerli test network, and 11155111 is Sepolia test network.\\n- <b>The address:</b> This is the actual address of the asset, encoded as a hexadecimal string.\\n\\nFor instance:\\n\\n```js\\neip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the namespace is eip155 which identifies EVM chains, the network ID is 5 (Goerli test network) and the address is <b>0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681</b>.\\n\\nCAIP is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for the inclusion of additional information as needed. It is used by the Push Protocol and other Ethereum-based projects as a standardized way of identifying and encoding information about crypto-assets, and distinguishing information from different chains.\\n\\nContinuing with <b>getFeeds</b>, to fetch spam notifications, set the <b>spam</b> parameter to <b>true</b>:\\n\\n```js\\nconst spams = await PushAPI.user.getFeeds({\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  spam: true,\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe <b>getFeeds</b> method returns a list of notifications for the specified user.\\n\\n## Fetching user subscriptions\\n\\nYou can use the <b>getSubscriptions</b> method to fetch a user\'s subscriptions. This method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\\n\\n- <b>user</b> (mandatory, string): The user\u2019s address in CAIP format.\\n- <b>env</b> (optional, string): The API environment to use. Possible values are \u2018prod\u2019 and \u2018staging\u2019. Default is \u2018prod\u2019.\\n  Here\u2019s an example of how you might use the <b>getSubscriptions</b> method in your code:\\n\\n```js\\nconst subscriptions = await PushAPI.user.getSubscriptions({\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe <b>getSubscriptions</b> method returns a list of channels <b>`[{ channel: \'0xaddress\', ... }]`</b> subscribed by the user.\\n\\n## Fetching channel details\\n\\nYou can use the <b>getChannel</b> method to fetch information about a specific channel. This method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\\n\\nchannel (mandatory, string): The channel\u2019s address in CAIP format.\\nenv (optional, string): The API environment to use. Possible values are \u2018prod\u2019 and \u2018staging\u2019. Default is \u2018prod\u2019.\\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might use the getChannel method in your code:\\n\\n```js\\nconst channelData = await PushAPI.channels.getChannel({\\n  channel: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe <b>getChannel</b> method returns an object with information about the channel.\\n\\n## Searching for channels\\n\\nYou can use the <b>search</b> method to search for channels based on a specified query. It takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\\n\\n- <b>query</b> (mandatory, string): The search query.\\n- <b>page</b> (optional, number): The page index of the results. Default is 1.\\n- <b>limi</b>t (optional, number): The number of items per page. Default is 10.\\n- <b>env</b> (optional, string): The API environment to use. Possible values are \u2018prod\u2019 and \u2018staging\u2019. Default is \u2018prod\u2019.\\n\\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might use the <b>search</b> method in your code:\\n\\n```js\\nawait PushAPI.channels.subscribe({\\n  signer: _signer,\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  channel: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe <b>subscribe</b> method returns a confirmation of the subscription.\\n\\n## Opting out of a channel\\n\\nYou can use the unsubscribe method to allow a user to opt out of a specific channel. This method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\\n\\n- <b>signer</b> (mandatory, object): The object that signs the unsubscription transaction.\\n- <b>user</b> (mandatory, string): The user\u2019s address in CAIP format.\\n- <b>channel</b> (mandatory, string): The channel\u2019s address in CAIP format.\\n- <b>env</b> (optional, string): The API environment to use. Possible values are \u2018prod\u2019 and \u2018staging\u2019. Default is \u2018prod\u2019.\\n  Here\u2019s an example of how you might use the <b>unsubscribe</b> method in your code:\\n\\n## Sending a notification\\n\\nYou can use the <b>sendNotification</b> method from the payloads object to send a direct payload notification to a specific recipient, group of recipients, or all recipients. This method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\\n\\n<b>signer</b> (mandatory, object): The object representing the signer for the transaction. <br />\\n\\n<b>type</b> (mandatory, number): The type of recipient. Possible values are 1 (broadcast), 3 (single recipient), and 4 (group of recipients). <br />\\n\\n<b>identityType</b> (mandatory, number): The identity type of the recipient. Possible values are 2 (direct payload). <br />\\n\\n<b>notification</b> (mandatory, object): An object representing the notification. <br />\\n\\n- <b>title</b> (mandatory, string): The title of the notification.\\n- <b>body</b> (mandatory, string): The body of the notification.\\n  <b>payload</b> (mandatory, object): An object representing the payload.\\n\\n- <b>title</b> (mandatory, string): The title of the payload.\\n- <b>body</b> (mandatory, string): The body of the payload.\\n- <b>cta</b> (optional, string): The call-to-action of the payload.\\n- <b>img</b> (optional, string): The image of the payload. <br />\\n\\n<b>recipients</b> (optional, string or array of strings): The recipient address(es) in CAIP format. Only required for type 3 (single recipient) or type 4 (group of recipients). <br />\\n\\n<b>channel</b> (mandatory, string): The channel\u2019s address in CAIP format. <br />\\n\\n<b>env</b> (optional, string): The API environment to use. Possible values are \u2018prod\u2019 and \u2018staging\u2019. Default is \u2018prod\u2019. <br />\\n\\nHere are examples of how you might use the <b>sendNotification</b> method in your code:\\n\\n<b>Single recipient (target):</b>\\n\\n```js\\nconst apiResponse = await PushAPI.payloads.sendNotification({\\n  signer,\\n  type: 3, // target\\n  identityType: 2, // direct payload\\n  notification: {\\n    title: `[SDK-TEST] notification TITLE:`,\\n    body: `[sdk-test] notification BODY`,\\n  },\\n  payload: {\\n    title: `[sdk-test] payload title`,\\n    body: `sample msg body`,\\n    cta: \'\',\\n    img: \'\',\\n  },\\n  recipients: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\', // recipient address\\n  channel: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\', // your channel address\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\n<b>Group of recipients (subset):</b>\\n\\n```js\\nconst apiResponse = await PushAPI.payloads.sendNotification({\\n  signer,\\n  type: 4, // subset\\n  identityType: 2, // direct payload\\n  notification: {\\n    title: `[SDK-TEST] notification TITLE:`,\\n    body: `[sdk-test] notification BODY`,\\n  },\\n  payload: {\\n    title: `[sdk-test] payload title`,\\n    body: `sample msg body`,\\n    cta: \'\',\\n    img: \'\',\\n  },\\n  recipients: [\\n    \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n    \'eip155:11155111:0xCdBE6D076e05c5875D90fa35cc85694E1EAFBBd1\',\\n  ], // recipients addresses\\n  channel: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\', // your channel address\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\n<b>All recipients (broadcast):</b>\\n\\n```js\\nconst apiResponse = await PushAPI.payloads.sendNotification({\\n  signer,\\n  type: 1, // broadcast\\n  identityType: 2, // direct payload\\n  notification: {\\n    title: `[SDK-TEST] notification TITLE:`,\\n    body: `[sdk-test] notification BODY`,\\n  },\\n  payload: {\\n    title: `[sdk-test] payload title`,\\n    body: `sample msg body`,\\n    cta: \'\',\\n    img: \'\',\\n  },\\n  channel: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\', // your channel address\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe <b>sendNotification</b> method returns a confirmation (apiResponse) of the notification being sent, with a status code of 204 indicating success.\\n\\nThat\u2019s it!
