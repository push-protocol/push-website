Then, I went to study computer science in Moscow, where I met Natalia (my Vitalik\u2019s mom) and got married. Then Vitalik was born, and I watched the Soviet Union fall apart, ended up accidentally starting a business with a few friends, eventually moving to Canada 22 years ago, and living here in Toronto, Canada, ever since.

Most people were more or less in the same position financially, there was a lot of propaganda about how bad the west is and that they were trying to destroy our freedoms and our quest for communism or whatever was happening. So yeah, there was lots of propaganda, lots of family times. Our family had a huge library and I loved reading books and also grew up in a region which had a lot of ethnic tension so that was also part of their background.

So one huge lesson early on was that you have to sell it, you have to promote it and again growing up in the Soviet Union, the whole concept of selling and marketing was totally foreign. As you learn about this, for me as a guy who is smart and technical, it was like \u201coh, I have to talk to people and try to convince them, oh my god this is scary\u201d.

It\u2019s not anything else. It\u2019s like you try to identify what is the problem, who are the people who have this problem, then try to figure out the solution. Hopefully, this solution is better than other existing solutions. Then you keep listening to your customers to keep improving. You know the solution, you know what you are offering. Make it better, present it better to build up your reputation. That\u2019s really what entrepreneurship is. These were the first wave of lessons."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There are many others, like think of any business however unique it is, but also think about this in a structured way: a business has to build stuff, a business has to sell and market stuff, a business has to have a controlling accounting function and a business has to have a people function."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There are awesome frameworks out there, so it\u2019s really important to think about business. I mean it\u2019s useful, I found that to think about business in a very structured way, so that was another layer of lessons around that. Additionally, of course eventually you realize that a business is built on people. In my personal experience, I\u2019ve been \u201call in\u2019\u2019 tech businesses. In tech businesses you get to work with really smart amazing people. I love working with them but they can also be very hard to work with because if so many of us are smart, we end up over-aligning our brains. We think we know what\u2019s happening and we know it better than anybody else. We\u2019re so much smarter than everybody else but learning humility, learning about human emotions and emotional intelligence and all of the soft skills, that\u2019s a different dimension of learning. An extremely important one."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So in business it\u2019s really about understanding people, understanding why this person is working here. On the surface you can say, you know we pay them money and they do what I tell them but that\u2019s basically because, again in high-tech business if you want to build a successful high-tech business, you work with smart people, smart people who create amazing technologies can find jobs very easily. They\u2019re not really here for whatever money they\u2019re making here, money is useful and important and great resources but it is really important for them to understand why this business exists, what it does, is it making anything good? Are we here just to try to make some money? and spend that money? That\u2019s not exciting, right."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The purpose of a business is extremely important to understand, being human in the business.

I learned about it pretty much by accident, I think it was mentioned on a podcast that i\u2019ve been listening for many years the podcast was about security of information systems but the guy (Steve Gibson) had a very curious mind and he mentions all these kinds of stuff, he mentioned bitcoin so I looked it up and explored it and it seemed like such a fascinating technology which was trying to create money without any kind of central authority and again, I cannot say that I paid a lot of attention to bitcoin and crypto until Vitalik really got into crypto space and then after seeing his interest in that, I started paying more attention and you know with his involvement and bitcoin magazine i started reading all of the"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"issues of bitcoin magazine and that was one of the skills that Vitalik always had that he could take a very complex thing right and all of those things people were trying to build on top of bitcoin or enhance bitcoin in some ways and then he could explain it really well for relatively non-technical people so i enjoyed learning through all of those articles and eventually eight years ago when Vitalik came up with their concept of Ethereum and i remember like in this very house where i\u2019m sitting right now and he was sitting upstairs at the table and he showed me like \u201coh hey, check it out i\u2019ve been working on this thing you know here\u2019s a little white paper description of what it is and what do you think about this\u201d right and i read the document and even though i only had the superficial knowledge of character but his writing was always very precise and concise and well and you know easy to understand so i\u2019m reading this like, this makes total sense right and I mentioned that a few times that there\u2019s the analogy that came to me and I used it quite a lot but bitcoin like, it was such an awesome invention for digital trustless money, I observed the emergence of internet so i saw the early websites that were built on html, just lines and maybe some colors, some images and then they became this interactive complicated, flashy, complex systems. When the programming languages were added to internet like EB script and javascript and whatnot, and for me ethereum was like, I could see that here\u2019s this technology, but if we add programming language on top of this then it will become infinitely more flexible and you can do so much more with that right, the sky is the limit and then of course I had really no idea how complicated that would be and i guess Vitalik had some idea of how complicated that would be but nobody could have imagined the journey that was undertaken by the idea of ethereum over the last eight years."}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Harsh :"})," Yep, I mean I love that analogy, by the way I read about it but he wanted to hear it again, so like Vitalik is someone we all look up to, his creation, his vision, I mean we are here because you know he created this thing.

So when we moved to Canada, he was only six years old when we started living there and again learning a new language was a bit of a challenge but not a huge deal necessarily. Then he went to school and it was clear to his teachers that he was extremely gifted and then he ended up going to a gifted school and then we also sent him to all kinds of extra curriculum teachers and facilities to help him learn all kinds of stuff and yeah I mean that\u2019s really something specific because there\u2019s so much stuff."]}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Harsh :"})," Got it, so let\u2019s go with what\u2019s your favorite or one of your favorite moments with Vitalik?"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Dmitry :"})," Like there are so many of them right, but you know any parent knows that when you have children especially, when they are young, you want to buy them toys that you could not afford when you were growing up and i\u2019m no exception so I remember when I was trying to buy him all kinds of lego sets because i used to dream about them and you know in the Soviet Union, there wasn\u2019t much that you could get your hands on. No legos that\u2019s for sure and the funny thing is that when he started playing with them, i think there\u2019s a picture in their article today, like instead of building houses and stuff he was actually building numbers like \u201chere\u2019s five!\u201d \u201chere\u2019s six!\u201d and you know you could see that, numbers, they played a very important part in this, so I mean that\u2019s kind of one of those little moments but again there are so many like teaching him to ride the bike, and you know getting him to try his first burger and all of those things."]}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Harsh :"})," That\u2019s so awesome to know.
