In reality, interop and the desire to defragment has been with us from the moment Bitcoin on/off-ramp came to existence!</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"the-interop-spectrum\">The Interop Spectrum<a href=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#the-interop-spectrum\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The Interop Spectrum\" title=\"Direct link to The Interop Spectrum\">​</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"1-the-first-interop---centralized-exchanges\">1. The First Interop - Centralized Exchanges<a href=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#1-the-first-interop---centralized-exchanges\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to 1. The First Interop - Centralized Exchanges\" title=\"Direct link to 1. The First Interop - Centralized Exchanges\">​</a></h3>\n<p>The desire for an interoperable and defragmented web3 has been with us ever since the first Bitcoin on/off-ramp took off. No sooner did it come into existence than our desire to make it tradable with traditional finance (TradFi) arose. This need was further deepened with the rise of other layer 1s such as Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano etc.</p>\n<p>The user's need was clear: a unified interface which allowed the trading of different crypto assets directly and instantly. Centralised exchanges (CEXs) arose to fulfil this need. They abstracted away the complexity of different chains from the frontend at the cost of introducing trust assumptions and centralisation at the backend.</p>\n<p>This era saw the origin of many CEXs, some of which have since disappeared (such as Mt. Gox), and others that have become household crypto names (such as Coinbase and Binance). While this worked for the users who wanted convenience, it also exposed issues with centralizing decentralized assets, giving us the next problem we had to tackle.</p>\n<p>The Progressive Problem - CEXs, with their centralized custody, opened up new issues for crypto and web3. Most of them arose from the very nature of custodial design which included exchanges getting hacked, users getting locked out or losing time before getting their funds and of course, the rare but not uncommon issue of exchange founders vanishing with keys that custodied the user funds.</p>\n<p>This led us, the web3 collective, to work towards solving these issues which resulted in the <strong>next iterative innovation</strong> in chasing interop. A solution known as <strong>atomic swaps</strong> - a method by which two chains could perform a trustless exchange.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"2-atomic-swaps---hashlock-time-contracts-between-compatible-chains\">2. Atomic Swaps - Hashlock time contracts between compatible chains<a href=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#2-atomic-swaps---hashlock-time-contracts-between-compatible-chains\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to 2. Atomic Swaps - Hashlock time contracts between compatible chains\" title=\"Direct link to 2. Atomic Swaps - Hashlock time contracts between compatible chains\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Atomic swaps were so named because they turned a 'swap' into a self-contained unit of operations on smart contracts which would succeed or fail as a bundle. This was done to prevent situations in which one side fulfils its side of the bargain but the other does not. We will later see how this idea of 'atomicity' survives to this day in solver networks.</p>\n<p>Proposed on a Bitcoin forum in 2013 as 'hash-time locked contracts' (HTLCs), the first iteration of atomic swaps involved two smart contracts (one each on the source and destination chains) operating together to form a digital escrow with a shared secret.</p>\n<p>What makes them historically significant is that they were the first peer-to-peer chain-agnostic interop solution. Initially, they unified the interop design space by showing that trustless cross-chain swaps were possible between all ecosystems. Over time, however, they resulted in a new round of competition between 'HTLC compatible' chains.</p>\n<p><strong>The Progressive Problem</strong> - Despite being peer-to-peer, HTLCs were unable to 'solve' the interop problem due to two important limitations: (a) They involved multiple transactions leading to scalability challenges. (b) Different blockchains had their own standards which were not compatible.</p>\n<p>These bottlenecks led to the <strong>next iterative innovations</strong>: in the form of <strong>decentralised exchanges</strong> (DEXs) and <strong>multi-chain wallets</strong>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"3-local-interop-and-non-custodial-solutions\">3.

Its key innovation was to replace centralised orderbooks with automated market making algorithms (AMMs) and decentralised liquidity pools. This solved a lot of problems for advanced web3 users as they could conduct asset swaps directly from their wallets (yes if you used Metamask back then, you were an advanced user!).</p>\n<p>Technically speaking, such systems suffered from two fundamental limitations: (a) They required knowledge of how particular blockchains work (for instance, ERC-20 token function calls of Approve and Transfer was not something an average joe understood). (b) They were limited to their own chains.</p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"32-multi-chain-wallets\">3.2 Multi-Chain Wallets<a href=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#32-multi-chain-wallets\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to 3.2 Multi-Chain Wallets\" title=\"Direct link to 3.2 Multi-Chain Wallets\">​</a></h4>\n<p>Around the same time, crypto wallets emerged that offered the convenience of self-custody, i.e., the ability to store tokens outside the ambit of exchanges. Although bulk of the trading still took place on CEXs, the user now had the option of using non-custodial wallets which could be standalone (e.g. Metamask, Electron) or multi-chain (e.g. Exodus, Trust).</p>\n<p><strong>The Progressive Problem</strong> - Even with DEXs and multi-chain wallets, problems with swapping between different chains remained. At the same time, EVMs were going through countless innovations and purpose built L2 chains started propping up.</p>\n<p>This led to the <strong>next iterative innovation</strong>, i.e. <strong>Bridging</strong>, which usually followed a ‘Lock and Mint’ solution. A standard on Cosmos also became popular in this time known as IBC(Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol).</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"4-bridging-to-solve-interop-between-chains\">4. Bridging to solve Interop between chains<a href=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#4-bridging-to-solve-interop-between-chains\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to 4. Bridging to solve Interop between chains\" title=\"Direct link to 4. Bridging to solve Interop between chains\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Bridging was an excellent solution, albeit not without its own set of issues. It aimed to tackle moving funds between chains by first locking them on a smart contract and then using a set of validators, attesting and releasing the funds on other chains.</p>\n<p>As is the nature of permissionless technologies, countless innovations emerged in parallel. We will consider the two main ones. First, trusted or semi-trusted bridging, which was how BTC was locked to mint WBTC, with minting being handled by a trusted set of custodians (WBTC DAO).</p>\n<p>Second, which became the successor and was largely adopted in the industry was trustless bridging, involving a set of nodes attesting to the asset movement between chains. Some of the popular bridging solutions that we got were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wormhole</strong>, where you locked your token on one chain and released it on another chain, the caveat being that as a developer, you had to tweak your smart contracts and bridging was usually slow. But this also meant locking all funds on one smart contract on a chain which opened a couple of attack vectors such as smart contract vulnerabilities or oracle manipulations, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>IBC</strong>, which required running light clients on both the chains, which handled proof verification before moving funds; though this was limited mainly to Cosmos or required oracles with light node smart contracts on non-Cosmos chains to function leading to adaptation limited to only the Cosmos ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>ZK Proofs</strong> and <strong>Optimistic Proofs</strong> that ensured Ethereum L1 to L2s transfer which were quite fast but at times expensive to compute or required several days of challenge period to escape (revert) back to L1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Progressive Problem</strong> - Bridging solved the trustlessness problem to an extent but largely was slow, forcing users to wait between movements or were fragmented or limited to a few eco-systems of chains.</p>\n<p>This led to the <strong>next iterative innovation</strong>, which is known as the intent-solver system. In which an off-chain operator takes the risk (in exchange for a fee) for offering convenience and speed for moving funds across chains.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"5-intent-solvers-networks---bridging-on-steroids\">5. Intent Solvers Networks - Bridging on Steroids<a href=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#5-intent-solvers-networks---bridging-on-steroids\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to 5. Intent Solvers Networks - Bridging on Steroids\" title=\"Direct link to 5. Intent Solvers Networks - Bridging on Steroids\">​</a></h3>\n<p>With intent solver networks, we have entered the current era of interop solutions. They are arguably the biggest improvement we have seen since the days of CEXs.</p>\n<p>The way they work is quite novel: instead of bridging (that requires trusted validators or decentralized validators to slowly attest and then move funds) they flip the attestation and risk away from the smart contract (used to lock and mint in bridges) and gives it to off-chain specialized actors that almost instantly fill the user’s intent(bridging, trading of assets, etc) using their own liquidity.</p>\n<p>This feature works in the following way: :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user provides their intent such as “swap minimum ETH for USDT on Base” or “Swap SOL for minimum USDT on Ethereum”.</li>\n<li>Along with this, the user either deposits assets, plus a small fee for solvers on a smart contract on the source chain or approves the assets to be used off-chain (mostly after they have already called approve on that app-specific smart contract).</li>\n<li>These instructions are then taken to a solver network, which, in the simplest terms are made of single off-chain actors that at least have the desired asset liquidity on the destination chain.</li>\n<li>The network then does an auction of sorts, which can be based on speed or cost. One popular auction mechanism done over is reverse Dutch auction, where the fee starts from the maximum point that will be paid and these off-chain solvers each bid a fee to win the auction. In the end, the lowest fee solver wins the bid and is tasked with fulfilling the intent.</li>\n<li>All of this takes less than a few seconds to be completed, after which the solver fulfils the obligation using its own liquidity on the destination chain, ensuring that the user gets their funds lightning fast.</li>\n<li>Later on, the solver submits the proof on the source smart contract, which mostly uses oracles to verify that the solver has done their job and then subsequently releases the funds to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach improves speed (typically happens within a few seconds), eliminates the attack vector of a single bloated smart contract worth millions of dollars, and is also scalable. But it does not (yet) mean that we have a magic bullet for web3 interop.</p>\n<p><strong>The Progressive Problem</strong> - The main problem with such networks is that they require a high degree of specialisation with unclear incentives for participation (e.g. solvers would much rather become liquidity providers and earn more). They may also be app-controlled which can lead to vendor lock-in, or highly function-specific which can result in avoidable coordination costs.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, they need a reliable infrastructure on the app side (such as an oracle network) in order to determine the best trade routes. Even the simplest intents require precise and up to date knowledge of prices, a problem which is compounded as more chains get involved. And finally, there's the problem of liquidity pool coordination and rebalancing, which creates additional risk and complexity.</p>\n<p>These problems have led us to design a new approach or the <strong>next iterative innovation</strong> keeping with the spirits of this article. We are terming them as '<strong>generalised programmable solvers'</strong> that can optimise, eliminate added infra and execute any custom routes which might be required by any developers of any app.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"6-generalized-programmable-solvers---solvers-that-are-smarter-co-ordinated-and-generalized\">6. Generalized Programmable Solvers - Solvers that are smarter, co-ordinated and generalized<a href=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#6-generalized-programmable-solvers---solvers-that-are-smarter-co-ordinated-and-generalized\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to 6. Generalized Programmable Solvers - Solvers that are smarter, co-ordinated and generalized\" title=\"Direct link to 6. Generalized Programmable Solvers - Solvers that are smarter, co-ordinated and generalized\">​</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Programmable solvers</strong> is a term that we have coined at Push Chain to distinguish the next step in innovation that the solvers require to work at scale.</p>\n<p>At its simplest, it means that developers will have shared state access to other blockchains, i.e. the ability to read, fetch and utilise the state of other chains. This will allow them to create custom pathways for fulfilling intents, all from a single universal EVM smart contract deployed on Push Chain.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Universal Smart Contract Example (Pseudocode)\" src=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/assets/images/image-2-b2d98b955f86d833d7c1872a9cd5f944.webp\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1103\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>This approach solves a lot of issues that hamper the adoption of solvers in web3. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eliminates the need for having an external oracle or underlying infrastructure</strong>: Shared state within Push Chain enables developers to logically code what their solvers need to do given different circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, if someone wants to swap $TRUMP from Solana and they have USDT on BNB, they will be able to read the BNB-USDT value from PancakeSwap, the SOL-USDT value from Raydium, and thus calculate the $TRUMP-USDT value from Raydium; all from a single smart contract deployed on Push Chain!</p>\n<p>Once you have these values, just provide basic(atomic) solver instructions from your smart contract (still on Push Chain) and then let the solver network do its magic.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enables anyone to be a solver / solves LP co-ordination:</strong> Once the solver network has a basic path, anyone can simply choose to run a basic solver software instead of creating a specialized one as the basic path is already provided. Though this doesn’t stop specialized solvers as they can then optimize the pathway by creating their own custom logic. The Solver network is now for everyone, instead of a few specialized actors.</li>\n<li><strong>Allows specialized solvers pooling</strong>: Since the path can consist of different atomic steps – in the above example: swapping, bridging, protocol interaction – each one of these can be provided to action-specific specialized solvers, further solving the co-ordination issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Enables any app to use solver network and be fully interoperable</strong>: Since all the functionalities are driven by a single universal smart contract deployed by the developer on Push Chain, the interop solution is now developer friendly, no matter what apps they are creating. Furthermore, it can be deployed in hours if not minutes!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Progressive Problem</strong> - The only problem this solution doesn’t address is the burden it places on the user to come to Push Chain to leverage the solution.</p>\n<p>Which, of course, brings us to the <strong>next and final iterative solution - Full Stack Interop</strong>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"7-full-stack-interop---push-chain-universal-l1\">7.

The migration will occur at a ratio of <strong>1:15</strong>—meaning for each Push Protocol ($PUSH) token you hold, you'll receive 15 Push Chain tokens. For example, if you currently hold 40 $PUSH tokens, you'll receive 600 Push Chain tokens after migration.</p>\n<p>The launch of Push Chain is designed to reward and incentivize prior Push Protocol ($PUSH) holders for their loyalty and contribution. The migration process for existing $PUSH token holders will work as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tokens will migrate at a 1:15 ratio (1 Push Protocol token = 15 Push Chain tokens).</li>\n<li>Participants in the Push Chain migration will see 50% of their migrated tokens unlocked immediately, and an additional 50% unlocked after 3 months.</li>\n<li>Token migrators will also benefit from a dedicated yield farming pool reserved for them.

And at normie gatherings I'm asked which crypto is best for starters. Until now I used to think of these as two distinct questions coming from two distinct audiences, i.e. technical and non-technical. My responses were conditioned by this assumption. At the former I used to talk about our '<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/innovations-by-push-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shared state</a>' approach and how it is distinguishable from interoperability (more on that below and in subsequent articles). And to the normies I used to suggest that starting-points can be subjective because different projects are trying to do different things. Some for instance are building reliable forms of decentralised cash, while others are trying to democratise the financial system. Still others are trying to get social media out of the hands of big tech, and a lot of them are just having fun.</p>\n<p>The problem with my approach was that it left out the real audience: the 'web3 curious'. This is a huge category which cannot be ignored, and I'm going to define it rather broadly as those people who have heard of crypto and played around with it a bit <a href=\"https://push.org/blog/why-push-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">without digging deeper</a>. You could say the real reason why they got into the whole thing was quick money. But in order for that to happen I feel they must <em>at some level believe</em> in the larger crypto project. To put it differently, <em>even if</em> they thought they were playing around with 'magic internet money', some part of them must have known that the magic was real (or had the potential of <em>becoming</em> real). That's the part of the collective psyche we need to reach.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"ecosystem-abstraction\">Ecosystem Abstraction<a href=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/another-l1#ecosystem-abstraction\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Ecosystem Abstraction\" title=\"Direct link to Ecosystem Abstraction\">​</a></h3>\n<p>To return to the earlier point, I now feel that both audiences were asking me the same thing in different ways, i.e. <em>which ecosystem?</em> It's often said that a few years in crypto equals decades in the real world. To me this was never a throwaway sentiment but a profound ground-truth about our industry. When crypto was just starting out people used to debate whether it had 'inherent value' and whether it could ever become 'money'. Those questions have more or less disappeared today because most people have concluded that it does. Thanks to the SEC, the critical regulatory question today seems to be whether a particular crypto is a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/08/14/how-the-secs-charge-that-cryptos-are-securities-could-face-an-uphill-battle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">security</a> or not. But of course it took humanity more than a thousand years to get from money to finance.</p>\n<p>The lesson we can draw from this is that the forms of '<a href=\"https://medium.com/@adamnite/a-history-of-crypto-tribalism-11f9f9c5cbaf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crypto tribalism</a>' we see today are comparable to <a href=\"https://www.wideopenspaces.com/native-american-totem-animals-origins-totem-poles-meaning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">historical tribes</a> who hitched their identity to particular totems and money-objects. We took a giant leap when we adopted the human-first-tribe-later perspective. This allowed us to <em>abstract away particular ecosystems</em> and develop a more global outlook. Of course I am not suggesting that our particular cultural attributes disappeared with modernity, but rather that they were preserved within a more <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Is-Push-Chain-another-L1-188188aea7f4801a8e5dc22d0c20e0f3?pvs=21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">'universal' wrapper</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"cities--bridges\">Cities &amp; Bridges<a href=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/another-l1#cities--bridges\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Cities &amp; Bridges\" title=\"Direct link to Cities &amp; Bridges\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Simply put, ‘ecosystem abstraction’ is my general response to both questions posed above. I see it as <a href=\"https://thenetworkstate.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an ongoing process</a> that Push aims to accelerate -- comparable perhaps to globalisation which aims to overcome national boundaries -- rather than as a quantifiable end state. What this means in concrete terms is that we are building a non-competitive L1 that does not distinguish between normies and crypto-natives.</p>\n<p>Why, you wonder? Because it’s the <a href=\"https://push.org/blog/what-is-consumer-crypto-and-why-does-it-matter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">final ecosystem barrier</a> standing between us and mass adoption. Moreover, it allows us to approach technical problems with a fresh perspective. Consider interoperability. By and large it means two things in crypto: unifying different chains via bridges and developing common standards. The first is a necessary, but more importantly, <em>organic</em> approach because bridges between two parts of a city aren't built unless there is significant traffic between them. The trouble right now is that the two sides are run by different municipal authorities, and every time you have to cross between them you must take fresh authorisation from an agent who operates a toll booth.</p>\n<p>Now if this were a real city the citizens would petition the Mayor and get things changed. They would most likely ask for a monthly ticket and some sort of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">‘fast tag’</a> on their cars which could automatically calculate and deduct the toll-fees from their wallets. But crypto is decentralised and there is no Mayor to petition. So for us the only solution is to get both municipal authorities to agree on a system for quick and trustworthy communication. Moreover, if both sides have different ticketing systems then they would need to develop a common ticketing standard which is mutually recognised.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"necessity-led-invention\">Necessity-led invention<a href=\"https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/another-l1#necessity-led-invention\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Necessity-led invention\" title=\"Direct link to Necessity-led invention\">​</a></h3>\n<p>In crypto, the reason why interoperability is an especially difficult problem to crack is because it requires unbroken coordination and synchronicity between different ecosystems. With every new chain that is added to the mix, the patchwork expands and becomes more unwieldy. It is therefore legitimate for people to wonder whether we are ‘another L1’ which is ultimately going to increase this messiness.</p>\n<p>The short answer is no: Push is not building its own separate municipality in its own corner of the city. Instead we are building systems (such as <a href=\"https://whitepaper.push.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">solver networks and fees quotas</a>) through which bridge-operators can communicate and coordinate. Imagine if a <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/189188aea7f480faaba5f80052406759?pvs=21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tourist</a> was visiting the city and wanted to pass through three different bridges in a single drive. The bridge-operators would need to reach consensus on various things including: (a) does he have enough money for all the tolls? (2) is he a legitimate (non-malicious) actor, and (c) has he received necessary permissions from the respective Mayors of the source and destination cities, etc.</p>\n<p>In the context of crypto these steps are reducible to verifiable cross-chain communications, and because Push has been working on this problem from its origin, it is uniquely positioned to create such a system. In other words, the move towards Push Chain was driven by the realisation that we had to do our bit to move the needle on interoperability, not in order to create our own fragmented ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Personally, what is most exciting for me is thinking about the new use-cases that such a cross-chain-communication-grid unlocks. Imagine if an <em>Aurory</em> or <em>Star Atlas</em> player is able to leverage Uniswap or Polymarket through in-game intent solvers, or if an artist is able to launch NFTs of their work simultanously across Opensea, Magic Eden and Jpg.store. Here's how my friend and colleague Zee put it in a recent conversation: \"we're trying to build systems where people can use their favourite apps on their favourite chains without friction or second thought.\"</p>\n<p>Yes it's an ambitious road, but we're determined.</p>\n<p>LFPush!</p>",
