<p>Welcome to the 2nd Volume of  - Apps that are only possible with Push Chain’s shared state architecture!</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://push.org/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous edition</a>, we covered use cases spanning Defi, cross chain yields, universal airdrops and NFTs that can only be possible using capabilities that chains like Push Chain provide.</p>
<p>🚨SPOILER ALERT - You might be able to see some of them in Testnet V1!Stay tuned!</p>
<p>In this iteration, we will amp up the utility scale and explore few of the most popular areas - loved by both - devs &amp; users.</p>
<p>Before we begin, if you’re new to the concept of Shared Sates and Push Chain, here’s a quick recap:
Feel free to skip down to the use cases section if you’re already aware of these concepts.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-push-chain---super-quick-recap">What is Push Chain? - Super Quick Recap:<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v2#what-is-push-chain---super-quick-recap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Push Chain? - Super Quick Recap:" title="Direct link to What is Push Chain? - Super Quick Recap:">​</a></h2>
<p>Push Chain is an all-purpose universal chain that unites every existing and forthcoming chain together (under one roof).</p>
<b>It is a shared-state L1 blockchain designed to function as a universal app layer for users across any chain, any wallet and any app.</b>
<p>Combining this with the innovation of cross-chain fees and wallet abstraction, what you get is a blockchain able to read any other chain and… is accessible by users from any chain.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="First Image of Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.2" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/assets/images/image-1-e3682ce78fc7e7e3e72acdeac0c60ab4.webp" width="1394" height="1156" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>At its core, a blockchain maintains a database tracking the state of all wallets and smart contracts (token balances, data, code, etc.). But these states are siloed within their respective chains, even <i>within the same ecosystem.</i></p>
<p>For example, a wallet's ETH balance on Ethereum differs from its ETH balance on Base because each of these chains maintains its own state.</p>
<p>For building universal apps we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Read</b> states from other chains (e.g., balances, smart contract data).</li>
<li><b>Write</b> to all chains, and</li>
<li><b>Support wallets</b> across all networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these innovations -- i.e. the ability of developers on Push Chain <i>to read and utilise the state of other chains via smart contracts</i> -- is what we mean by a <b>shared-state blockchain.</b></p>

<p><b>Shared-state makes ‘chain wars’ real!</b>
It allows players from any blockchain ecosystem to come together and play their favourite games with (or against) each other by leveraging Push Chain as a shared settlement layer.</p>
<p>Think ‘<a href="https://chess.push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Chess</a>’ tournaments between Ethereum and Solana tribes, with a cross-chain betting widget for viewers and game NFTs for players. The perfect degen chess experience!</p>
<p>But it doesn’t stop there. Think Poker, Blackjack, Monopoly, RPGs and more, available to and accessible by users of all chains!</p>
<p>By removing the biggest barriers to on-chain game adoption, i.e. UX and asset fragmentation, <b>Push Chain allows gamers to bring their chain-specific identities to chain-neutral playgrounds.</b></p>

<p>Today, managing assets across multiple chains is a logistical nightmare.</p>
<p>Users must juggle separate wallets, track balances individually, and manually bridge funds — a process that’s both error-prone and inefficient. While ‘safes’ are a reliable way for groups to pool and manage assets (e.g. for DAOs, investment clubs, or even families), they face additional challenges due to multisig barriers.</p>
<p>Shared-state solves this by enabling <b>safes with multi-chain signers</b>, i.e. chain-agnostic vaults that can natively pool, manage and utilise assets across all chains.</p>
<p>This turns the chaos of fragmented assets into a streamlined, interoperable system — for individuals, DAOs, and institutions. With shared-state, Push Chain makes cross-chain asset-management as simple as using a single shared wallet.</p>

<p>Prediction markets are great tools for building alignment, coordination and conviction within groups. They can unlock a bunch of utility when combined with other on-chain activities such as DeFi, voting, gaming and content creation.</p>
<p>Today, however, they operate as isolated betting shops which are limited to specific chains, acceptable tokens and capacity to verify events (off or on-chain).</p>
<b>Shared-state changes all of this.</b>
<p>Push Chain enables <b>universally embeddable prediction markets</b> that can be attached to any cross-chain app, game, or event and can be used by users from any chain and any token.</p>
<p>Seamless routing liquidity across chains, without bridging.</p>
<p>Thus, turning fragmented cross-chain activities into a unified playground for probabilistic thinking.</p>

<p>Push Chain’s shared-state architecture finally delivers <b>the universal blockchain trifecta</b> — unifying user needs, developer needs, and cross-chain data unification – all in a single layer.</p>
<p>For users, it leads to seamless cross-chain interactions: no more juggling bridges, fragmented balances or chain-locked assets. Your entire on-chain identity — DeFi positions, NFTs, agentic memories, game assets etc. — becomes portable and composable across all networks.</p>
<p>For developers, shared-state unlocks an entirely new paradigm: read and unify fragmented assets without worrying about latency, cost, security or interoperability.</p>

<p>Crypto has come a long way.
And so has the extent of innovations that continue to make this space more adaptive, smooooth and fun!</p>
<p>Here are 5 super innovative use cases the industry could immensely benefit from using Shared State chains like Push Chain.</p>
<p>These use cases cover various bases, including but not limited to Defi, Degen Defi(iykyk), Art, Airdrops, DAOs and even Gaming.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-push-chain">What is Push Chain?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1#what-is-push-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Push Chain?" title="Direct link to What is Push Chain?">​</a></h2>
<p>Push Chain is an all-purpose universal chain that unites every existing and forthcoming chain together (under one roof).</p>
<p><strong>It is a shared-state L1 blockchain designed to function as a universal app layer for users across any chain, any wallet and any app.</strong></p>
<p>Combining this with the innovation of cross-chain fees and wallet abstraction, what you get is a <strong>blockchain able to read any other chain and… is accessible by users from any chain.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="push chain vein diagram" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/assets/images/image1-cd596484c7f06eaa8ef9c27a95f8b8ec.webp" width="1394" height="1156" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>At its core, a blockchain maintains a database tracking the state of all wallets and smart contracts (token balances, data, code, etc.). But these states are siloed within their respective chains, even within the same ecosystem.</p>
<p>For example, a wallet's ETH balance on Ethereum differs from its ETH balance on Base because each of these chains maintains its own state.</p>
<p>For building universal apps we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read</strong> states from other chains (e.g., balances, smart contract data).</li>
<li><strong>Write</strong> to all chains, and</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> <strong>wallets</strong> across all networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these innovations -- i.e. the ability of developers on Push Chain <em>to read and utilise the state of other chains</em> via smart contracts -- is what we mean by a <strong>shared-state blockchain</strong>.</p>

<p>DeFi today is fractured by:</p>
<ol>
<li>chain-bound liquidity,</li>
<li>cumbersome bridging,</li>
<li>and inconsistent pricing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our shared-state model tackles these problems by <strong>unifying access to assets and data across all networks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<p>Using cross-chain price oracles, our apps can aggregate real-time ETH/USD rates from Ethereum, Solana and Base, creating a more robust and manipulation-resistant feed. This ensures fair and accurate pricing data for both DeFi and payments.</p>
<p>Similarly, shared-state enables <strong>universal payment executors</strong> that can combine a payee’s balances from different chains, and calculate optimum routes for fulfilling merchant requests irrespective of the chain they’re on.</p>
<p>In the traditional web3 world, if a payee (like a merchant) wants to receive a payment, they usually specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>A chain (e.g. “Send to Ethereum”),</li>
<li>A token (e.g. “Send USDC”), and</li>
<li>An address (e.g. their ETH address).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This limits:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Which chain the payer can use.</li>
<li>What token they must use.</li>
<li>Operational comfort that forces bridging or manual swaps.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-this-enables"><em><strong>What this enables</strong></em><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1#what-this-enables" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-this-enables" title="Direct link to what-this-enables">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stripe-like cross-chain payments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>e.g. payee’s wallet can read real-time asset values from multiple sources and pool them for atomic settlement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="cross chain payments overview" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/assets/images/image4-d21e9d955f4096dae55bd1415d69cd9d.webp" width="1601" height="1551" class="img_ev3q"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seamless cross-chain trades with novel features like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collateral management</strong>
<ul>
<li>e.g. a user opens a leveraged position on Solana using ETH as collateral, but he also has some ETH on other chains like Arbitrum and BNB.</li>
<li>A shared-state app can read its balances and combine them to create a <strong>unified collateral</strong> <strong>pool,</strong> which can be used across all chains without bridging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Liquidation protection</strong>
<ul>
<li>e.g. if the ETH price drops by a higher percentage on Solana compared to other chains, a <strong>shared-state liquidation protector</strong> can:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Unlock balances on Arbitrum and BNB to balance the trade, and/or</li>
<li>Consult other sources (DEXes, oracles etc.) to calculate the average drop and forestall a liquidation event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Payment routing requires real-time asset and price checks across chains.</li>
<li>Finding and executing an optimal payment route across payers' wallets from different chains requires reading all the states.</li>
<li>Collateral managers and liquidation protectors cannot link different balances to the same user without fetching the state.</li>
<li>Price oracles need to aggregate and verify data from multiple sources.</li>

<p>Shared-state apps built on Push Chain can also function as <strong>universal yield aggregators</strong>. They can collect and show APYs from various chains, allowing the user to execute the most profitable staking transactions across any network without worrying about native reconversions or swaps.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-this-enables-1"><em><strong>What this enables</strong></em><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1#what-this-enables-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-this-enables-1" title="Direct link to what-this-enables-1">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Users are no longer tied to a particular blockchain or ecosystem to earn yields on their stablecoins or assets (whether native or foreign). True unchained universal yields.</li>
<li>Their <strong>aggregated yield routing</strong> enables optimal capital allocation across protocols, minimizing fragmentation and maximizing APY</li>
<li><strong>Universal Liquid Staking Tokens</strong> (ULSTs) can be created by combining and/or hybridizing existing ones (e.g. stETH, rETH, mSOL).</li>

<ul>
<li>Yields are a dynamic function of various on-chain data points (e.g. total staked supply, network inflation rules, validator slashing and reward metrics, gas fees and MEV protections). Their aggregation is impossible without accurate and verifiable cross-chain read capabilities.</li>
<li>Combined capital and ULSTs require proof of ownership of underlying assets.</li>

<p>A customizable universal exchange is one where you can trade any asset (fungible or non-fungible) against any other asset on any chain, with no need for both assets to exist in the same chain.</p>
<p>Currently, ‘trading pairs’ on exchanges are limited to recognized tokens, which have two limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>It adds a permissioning layer (good from a security perspective, but limits censorship resistance);</li>
<li>In an age where everything is being ‘tokenized’, it is necessary to create permissionless exchanges for customizable trading pairs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-this-enables-2"><em><strong>What this enables</strong></em><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1#what-this-enables-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-this-enables-2" title="Direct link to what-this-enables-2">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>With shared-state, apps can let users create their own custom exchange options, like an <strong>e-bay for on-chain assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>e.g. “willing to sell pudgy penguin NFT#44 for 100,000 $SHIB”.</li>
<li>Buyers and sellers can be connected through <strong>intent matching games like a cross-chain asset barter system</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>e.g. someone ‘willing to sell all his coins on Solana for two popular NFTs on Ethereum’ may be notified of the above trade</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="4-universal-airdrops">4 Universal Airdrops<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1#4-universal-airdrops" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4 Universal Airdrops" title="Direct link to 4 Universal Airdrops">​</a></h3>
<p>Traditionally, Airdrops are localized to a specific chain(Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum etc). The eligibility checks usually work only within the chain of the drop.</p>
<p>Shared-state chains like Push Chain allow us to query on-chain data from different chains, enabling the flexibility for crafting complex eligibility conditions spanning ecosystems, in a very convenient and unified manner.</p>
<p><em><strong>For example:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Cross-Chain Game Drop:</strong></p>
<p>A project launches a new gaming token.</p>
<p>Eligibility conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Played at least A,B,C games on Sonic SVM,</li>
<li>Bought a <a href="https://pudgypenguins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pudgy Penguin</a> or Lil Pudgy NFT on Ethereum,</li>
<li>Used Phantom Wallet,</li>
<li>Participated in a Gitcoin grant on Ethereum.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="cross chain airdrop overivew" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/assets/images/image7-7b0f8225f78c195470f82c46c6a7c411.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>A <strong>universal drop,</strong> in this case, can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify these diverse activities via shared-state reads.</li>
<li>Allow claiming the gaming token on Polygon, Solana, or Ethereum - whichever the user prefers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-this-enables-3"><em><strong>What this enables</strong></em><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1#what-this-enables-3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-this-enables-3" title="Direct link to what-this-enables-3">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Custom cross-chain algorithms for drop eligibility:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>e.g. filter wallets that have played a game on Arbitrum, participated in Gitcoin Grants via Celo, minted 2 NFTs on Solana and 3 content coins on Zora, over the last year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Launching a DeFi app? Design an airdrop for DeFi users across all chains to attract them to your platform.</li>
<li>Eligibility verifications and claims from any chain to any chain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-it-needs-shared-state-3"><em><strong>Why it needs shared-state</strong></em><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1#why-it-needs-shared-state-3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-it-needs-shared-state-3" title="Direct link to why-it-needs-shared-state-3">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Eligibility verification requires <strong>live access</strong> to wallet activity across multiple chains.</li>
<li>Without shared-state, projects must deploy separate scripts/contracts/oracles per chain, leading to fragmentation, delays, and higher infra costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="5-universal-nfts">5 Universal NFTs<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1#5-universal-nfts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5 Universal NFTs" title="Direct link to 5 Universal NFTs">​</a></h3>
<p>Today’s NFTs are trapped in single-chain ecosystems with rigid formats. (An NFT on Ethereum can’t natively interact with Solana or Aptos.).</p>
<p>It is virtually unheard of to have an NFT on one chain with its tokens on another (although projects such as Pudgy Penguins are pioneering this approach).</p>
<p>Moreover, at present, an NFT can neither be launched on different chains at once, nor can its attributes be natively read from them.</p>
<p>Push Chain redefines NFTs as <strong>dynamic,chain-agnostic digital primitives</strong> - assets whose ownership, metadata, and modes of expression can <strong>live and evolve across multiple chains</strong> simultaneously.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-this-enables-4"><em><strong>What this enables</strong></em><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1#what-this-enables-4" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-this-enables-4" title="Direct link to what-this-enables-4">​</a></h3>
<p>This not only makes them <em>universal</em> (i.e.&nbsp; capable of existing natively on all chains) but also gives them additional cross-chain features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Conditionality</strong>:</em> the ownership of an asset (or attribute) can be made conditional on custom cross-chain logics, for example:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>“Dynamically transfer the ownership of this NFT to a wallet on Solana that has the highest degen points on Base.”</li>
<li>“If the price of this token reaches 1$ on Cosmos, fractionalize it into 100 pieces and distribute them to wallets with the highest 24 hr trading volume on Aptos.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Multimodality</strong></em>: the same NFT can exist as a 2D image on Ethereum, a video on Base, a song on Solana, a narrative on Scroll and a 3D model on Arbitrum.</li>
<li><em><strong>Organicity</strong></em>: it can evolve across formats, for example:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A digital artwork could start as a static image which could give rise to a community-owned narrative;</li>
<li>As this narrative grows, the root image can give rise to distinct animation layers, each with its own set of owners.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Portability</strong></em>: Ownership of an NFT can act as portable proof across chains.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-it-needs-shared-state-4"><em><strong>Why it needs shared-state</strong></em><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1#why-it-needs-shared-state-4" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-it-needs-shared-state-4" title="Direct link to why-it-needs-shared-state-4">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In order for an NFT to be truly “non-fungible” across chains, the same user (or contract) must be able to provide reliable proofs of ownership from any chain to any chain.</li>
<li>Reading and writing of NFT metadata across chains.</li>
<li>Elimination of artificial "chain walls" that restrict creative evolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Push Chain’s shared-state architecture finally delivers <strong>the universal blockchain trifecta</strong> - unifying user needs, developer needs, and cross-chain data unification - all in a single layer.</p>
<p>For users, it leads to seamless cross-chain interactions: no more juggling bridges, fragmented balances or chain-locked assets. Your entire on-chain identity - DeFi positions, NFTs, agentic memories, game assets etc. becomes portable and composable across all networks.</p>
<p>For developers, shared-state unlocks an entirely new paradigm: universal apps that can natively read and write across all chains as if they were one.</p>
<p><em><strong>Seriously..</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Why build for one chain anymore</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>When you could build for them all?</strong></em></p>

<p>Web3 Interoperability (interop) is often seen as an imaginary creature, a unicorn that will never become real. This is because it's like a path on which the perfect destination is difficult to find, and there are tons of design choices, learning curves as well as UX compromises along the way.</p>
<p>Attempts to 'solve' interop within these constraints has led to a variety of solutions.</p>
<p>In this article, we provide a general overview of these approaches and show how they are all interconnected. We also highlight how the meaning of interop has shifted as the web3 industry has matured and expanded, and outline a possible endgame.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, i.e. full stack interoperability, we will discuss how interop started and, more importantly, why it should be viewed as a spectrum rather than a binary ‘0’ or ‘1‘. In reality, interop and the desire to defragment has been with us from the moment Bitcoin on/off-ramp came to existence!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-interop-spectrum">The Interop Spectrum<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#the-interop-spectrum" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Interop Spectrum" title="Direct link to The Interop Spectrum">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="1-the-first-interop---centralized-exchanges">1. The First Interop - Centralized Exchanges<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#1-the-first-interop---centralized-exchanges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. The First Interop - Centralized Exchanges" title="Direct link to 1. The First Interop - Centralized Exchanges">​</a></h3>
<p>The desire for an interoperable and defragmented web3 has been with us ever since the first Bitcoin on/off-ramp took off. No sooner did it come into existence than our desire to make it tradable with traditional finance (TradFi) arose. This need was further deepened with the rise of other layer 1s such as Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano etc.</p>
<p>The user's need was clear: a unified interface which allowed the trading of different crypto assets directly and instantly. Centralised exchanges (CEXs) arose to fulfil this need. They abstracted away the complexity of different chains from the frontend at the cost of introducing trust assumptions and centralisation at the backend.</p>
<p>This era saw the origin of many CEXs, some of which have since disappeared (such as Mt. Gox), and others that have become household crypto names (such as Coinbase and Binance). While this worked for the users who wanted convenience, it also exposed issues with centralizing decentralized assets, giving us the next problem we had to tackle.</p>
<p>The Progressive Problem - CEXs, with their centralized custody, opened up new issues for crypto and web3. Most of them arose from the very nature of custodial design which included exchanges getting hacked, users getting locked out or losing time before getting their funds and of course, the rare but not uncommon issue of exchange founders vanishing with keys that custodied the user funds.</p>
<p>This led us, the web3 collective, to work towards solving these issues which resulted in the <strong>next iterative innovation</strong> in chasing interop. A solution known as <strong>atomic swaps</strong> - a method by which two chains could perform a trustless exchange.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="2-atomic-swaps---hashlock-time-contracts-between-compatible-chains">2. Atomic Swaps - Hashlock time contracts between compatible chains<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#2-atomic-swaps---hashlock-time-contracts-between-compatible-chains" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Atomic Swaps - Hashlock time contracts between compatible chains" title="Direct link to 2. Atomic Swaps - Hashlock time contracts between compatible chains">​</a></h3>
<p>Atomic swaps were so named because they turned a 'swap' into a self-contained unit of operations on smart contracts which would succeed or fail as a bundle. This was done to prevent situations in which one side fulfils its side of the bargain but the other does not. We will later see how this idea of 'atomicity' survives to this day in solver networks.</p>
<p>Proposed on a Bitcoin forum in 2013 as 'hash-time locked contracts' (HTLCs), the first iteration of atomic swaps involved two smart contracts (one each on the source and destination chains) operating together to form a digital escrow with a shared secret.</p>
<p>What makes them historically significant is that they were the first peer-to-peer chain-agnostic interop solution. Initially, they unified the interop design space by showing that trustless cross-chain swaps were possible between all ecosystems. Over time, however, they resulted in a new round of competition between 'HTLC compatible' chains.</p>
<p><strong>The Progressive Problem</strong> - Despite being peer-to-peer, HTLCs were unable to 'solve' the interop problem due to two important limitations: (a) They involved multiple transactions leading to scalability challenges. (b) Different blockchains had their own standards which were not compatible.</p>
<p>These bottlenecks led to the <strong>next iterative innovations</strong>: in the form of <strong>decentralised exchanges</strong> (DEXs) and <strong>multi-chain wallets</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="3-local-interop-and-non-custodial-solutions">3. Local Interop and non-custodial solutions<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#3-local-interop-and-non-custodial-solutions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.

<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="31-local-interop-via-dexs">3.1 Local Interop via DEXs<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#31-local-interop-via-dexs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.1 Local Interop via DEXs" title="Direct link to 3.1 Local Interop via DEXs">​</a></h4>
<p>This breakthrough was led by Uniswap, which later pioneered not only decentralized finance (DeFi) but also kicked off the era of web3 apps. Its key innovation was to replace centralised orderbooks with automated market making algorithms (AMMs) and decentralised liquidity pools. This solved a lot of problems for advanced web3 users as they could conduct asset swaps directly from their wallets (yes if you used Metamask back then, you were an advanced user!).</p>
<p>Technically speaking, such systems suffered from two fundamental limitations: (a) They required knowledge of how particular blockchains work (for instance, ERC-20 token function calls of Approve and Transfer was not something an average joe understood). (b) They were limited to their own chains.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="32-multi-chain-wallets">3.2 Multi-Chain Wallets<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#32-multi-chain-wallets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.2 Multi-Chain Wallets" title="Direct link to 3.2 Multi-Chain Wallets">​</a></h4>
<p>Around the same time, crypto wallets emerged that offered the convenience of self-custody, i.e., the ability to store tokens outside the ambit of exchanges. Although bulk of the trading still took place on CEXs, the user now had the option of using non-custodial wallets which could be standalone (e.g. Metamask, Electron) or multi-chain (e.g. Exodus, Trust).</p>
<p><strong>The Progressive Problem</strong> - Even with DEXs and multi-chain wallets, problems with swapping between different chains remained. At the same time, EVMs were going through countless innovations and purpose built L2 chains started propping up.</p>
<p>This led to the <strong>next iterative innovation</strong>, i.e. <strong>Bridging</strong>, which usually followed a ‘Lock and Mint’ solution. A standard on Cosmos also became popular in this time known as IBC(Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="4-bridging-to-solve-interop-between-chains">4. Bridging to solve Interop between chains<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#4-bridging-to-solve-interop-between-chains" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Bridging to solve Interop between chains" title="Direct link to 4. Bridging to solve Interop between chains">​</a></h3>
<p>Bridging was an excellent solution, albeit not without its own set of issues. It aimed to tackle moving funds between chains by first locking them on a smart contract and then using a set of validators, attesting and releasing the funds on other chains.</p>
<p>As is the nature of permissionless technologies, countless innovations emerged in parallel. We will consider the two main ones. First, trusted or semi-trusted bridging, which was how BTC was locked to mint WBTC, with minting being handled by a trusted set of custodians (WBTC DAO).</p>
<p>Second, which became the successor and was largely adopted in the industry was trustless bridging, involving a set of nodes attesting to the asset movement between chains. Some of the popular bridging solutions that we got were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wormhole</strong>, where you locked your token on one chain and released it on another chain, the caveat being that as a developer, you had to tweak your smart contracts and bridging was usually slow. But this also meant locking all funds on one smart contract on a chain which opened a couple of attack vectors such as smart contract vulnerabilities or oracle manipulations, etc.</li>
<li><strong>IBC</strong>, which required running light clients on both the chains, which handled proof verification before moving funds; though this was limited mainly to Cosmos or required oracles with light node smart contracts on non-Cosmos chains to function leading to adaptation limited to only the Cosmos ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>ZK Proofs</strong> and <strong>Optimistic Proofs</strong> that ensured Ethereum L1 to L2s transfer which were quite fast but at times expensive to compute or required several days of challenge period to escape (revert) back to L1.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Progressive Problem</strong> - Bridging solved the trustlessness problem to an extent but largely was slow, forcing users to wait between movements or were fragmented or limited to a few eco-systems of chains.</p>
<p>This led to the <strong>next iterative innovation</strong>, which is known as the intent-solver system. In which an off-chain operator takes the risk (in exchange for a fee) for offering convenience and speed for moving funds across chains.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="5-intent-solvers-networks---bridging-on-steroids">5. Intent Solvers Networks - Bridging on Steroids<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#5-intent-solvers-networks---bridging-on-steroids" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Intent Solvers Networks - Bridging on Steroids" title="Direct link to 5. Intent Solvers Networks - Bridging on Steroids">​</a></h3>
<p>With intent solver networks, we have entered the current era of interop solutions. They are arguably the biggest improvement we have seen since the days of CEXs.</p>
<p>The way they work is quite novel: instead of bridging (that requires trusted validators or decentralized validators to slowly attest and then move funds) they flip the attestation and risk away from the smart contract (used to lock and mint in bridges) and gives it to off-chain specialized actors that almost instantly fill the user’s intent(bridging, trading of assets, etc) using their own liquidity.</p>
<p>This feature works in the following way: :</p>
<ul>
<li>The user provides their intent such as “swap minimum ETH for USDT on Base” or “Swap SOL for minimum USDT on Ethereum”.</li>
<li>Along with this, the user either deposits assets, plus a small fee for solvers on a smart contract on the source chain or approves the assets to be used off-chain (mostly after they have already called approve on that app-specific smart contract).</li>
<li>These instructions are then taken to a solver network, which, in the simplest terms are made of single off-chain actors that at least have the desired asset liquidity on the destination chain.</li>
<li>The network then does an auction of sorts, which can be based on speed or cost. One popular auction mechanism done over is reverse Dutch auction, where the fee starts from the maximum point that will be paid and these off-chain solvers each bid a fee to win the auction. In the end, the lowest fee solver wins the bid and is tasked with fulfilling the intent.</li>
<li>All of this takes less than a few seconds to be completed, after which the solver fulfils the obligation using its own liquidity on the destination chain, ensuring that the user gets their funds lightning fast.</li>
<li>Later on, the solver submits the proof on the source smart contract, which mostly uses oracles to verify that the solver has done their job and then subsequently releases the funds to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach improves speed (typically happens within a few seconds), eliminates the attack vector of a single bloated smart contract worth millions of dollars, and is also scalable. But it does not (yet) mean that we have a magic bullet for web3 interop.</p>
<p><strong>The Progressive Problem</strong> - The main problem with such networks is that they require a high degree of specialisation with unclear incentives for participation (e.g. solvers would much rather become liquidity providers and earn more). They may also be app-controlled which can lead to vendor lock-in, or highly function-specific which can result in avoidable coordination costs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they need a reliable infrastructure on the app side (such as an oracle network) in order to determine the best trade routes. Even the simplest intents require precise and up to date knowledge of prices, a problem which is compounded as more chains get involved. And finally, there's the problem of liquidity pool coordination and rebalancing, which creates additional risk and complexity.</p>
<p>These problems have led us to design a new approach or the <strong>next iterative innovation</strong> keeping with the spirits of this article. We are terming them as '<strong>generalised programmable solvers'</strong> that can optimise, eliminate added infra and execute any custom routes which might be required by any developers of any app.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="6-generalized-programmable-solvers---solvers-that-are-smarter-co-ordinated-and-generalized">6. Generalized Programmable Solvers - Solvers that are smarter, co-ordinated and generalized<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#6-generalized-programmable-solvers---solvers-that-are-smarter-co-ordinated-and-generalized" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 6. Generalized Programmable Solvers - Solvers that are smarter, co-ordinated and generalized" title="Direct link to 6. Generalized Programmable Solvers - Solvers that are smarter, co-ordinated and generalized">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Programmable solvers</strong> is a term that we have coined at Push Chain to distinguish the next step in innovation that the solvers require to work at scale.</p>
<p>At its simplest, it means that developers will have shared state access to other blockchains, i.e. the ability to read, fetch and utilise the state of other chains. This will allow them to create custom pathways for fulfilling intents, all from a single universal EVM smart contract deployed on Push Chain.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Universal Smart Contract Example (Pseudocode)" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/assets/images/image-2-b2d98b955f86d833d7c1872a9cd5f944.webp" width="2048" height="1103" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This approach solves a lot of issues that hamper the adoption of solvers in web3. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eliminates the need for having an external oracle or underlying infrastructure</strong>: Shared state within Push Chain enables developers to logically code what their solvers need to do given different circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if someone wants to swap $TRUMP from Solana and they have USDT on BNB, they will be able to read the BNB-USDT value from PancakeSwap, the SOL-USDT value from Raydium, and thus calculate the $TRUMP-USDT value from Raydium; all from a single smart contract deployed on Push Chain!</p>
<p>Once you have these values, just provide basic(atomic) solver instructions from your smart contract (still on Push Chain) and then let the solver network do its magic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enables anyone to be a solver / solves LP co-ordination:</strong> Once the solver network has a basic path, anyone can simply choose to run a basic solver software instead of creating a specialized one as the basic path is already provided. Though this doesn’t stop specialized solvers as they can then optimize the pathway by creating their own custom logic. The Solver network is now for everyone, instead of a few specialized actors.</li>
<li><strong>Allows specialized solvers pooling</strong>: Since the path can consist of different atomic steps – in the above example: swapping, bridging, protocol interaction – each one of these can be provided to action-specific specialized solvers, further solving the co-ordination issue.</li>
<li><strong>Enables any app to use solver network and be fully interoperable</strong>: Since all the functionalities are driven by a single universal smart contract deployed by the developer on Push Chain, the interop solution is now developer friendly, no matter what apps they are creating. Furthermore, it can be deployed in hours if not minutes!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Progressive Problem</strong> - The only problem this solution doesn’t address is the burden it places on the user to come to Push Chain to leverage the solution.</p>
<p>Which, of course, brings us to the <strong>next and final iterative solution - Full Stack Interop</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="7-full-stack-interop---push-chain-universal-l1">7. Full Stack Interop - Push Chain (Universal L1)<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#7-full-stack-interop---push-chain-universal-l1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 7. Full Stack Interop - Push Chain (Universal L1)" title="Direct link to 7. Full Stack Interop - Push Chain (Universal L1)">​</a></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Image" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/assets/images/image-3-7eec2fece4c0893ad137838f4ea40f9a.webp" width="720" height="546" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Push Chain which is a universal L1 chain offers full stack interop to enable a synergetic, unified web3, where <strong>any apps</strong> of <strong>any chain</strong> become accessible by <strong>any user or wallet</strong> of any chain.</p>
<p>To facilitate seamless functionality for <strong>developers</strong>, it enables <strong>programmable solvers, shared state</strong> and <strong>universal smart contracts</strong> making it the most seamless Developer Experience (DevEX) crypto has ever seen.</p>
<p>And to ensure a frictionless, zero-learning and hassle-free environment for users, it employs <strong>Cross-chain fee</strong> &amp; <strong>Wallet Abstraction</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-chain fee abstraction</strong> enables the user, no matter which chain they are on, to fund the gas for their transaction on Push Chain using native token of the chain they are currently on, eliminating the hassle for the user to bridge gas and allowing them to use the app from any chain.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet abstraction</strong> provides a flexible, embeddable wallet experience, tailored to individual user journeys while preserving decentralization. This type of abstraction offers a simpler UX to both existing and new web3 users.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existing Web3 Users:</strong> Already using Ethereum, Solana, or another chain? The Push Chain wallet lets you continue using your existing setup -—no extra hoops. Combined with fee abstraction, transactions stay native to the source blockchain, making cross-chain use effortless.</li>
<li><strong>New Web3 Users (Web2 Normies):</strong> Not web3-savvy? No problem. Just log in with an email or social account. Under the hood, the wallet uses sharding and passkeys to stay non-custodial, but feels as simple and intuitive as web2.</li>
</ul>
<p>By enabling seamless transactions from any chain, abstracting away gas and wallet complexities, and fostering interoperability across L1s, L2s, and L3s, Push Chain ensures a frictionless web3 experience for users and developers alike.</p>
<p>This results in a terraformed world of universal (fully interoperable) applications for web3. In this paradigm, instead of being a user of "Uniswap on Ethereum," "Uniswap on Polygon," or "Uniswap on Arbitrum," a person simply becomes a <strong>user of Uniswap</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>Interop is the end goal for ensuring that crypto apps arrive to mainstream users, no matter where they are from, or even if they get onboarded from web2.</p>
<p>Seeing interop as a spectrum helps us realize that it’s a problem that we have iteratively solved. Just like how web1 evolved to web2 and then to web3 to fix the problems of its predecessor.</p>
<p>Solving this is within our reach and thus the dream of enabling true interoperability from any app of any chain to any user of any chain.</p>
<p>Let’s build this future together, let’s build a better, more functional web3… and let’s build Universal / Fully Interoperable Apps!</p>
<p>It’s about time anyway 💪</p>]]></content>

<p>In late 2024, the Push community voted to approve the launch of Push Chain, a shared state layer 1 blockchain designed to enable the development and scale of universal applications.</p>
<p>Push Chain is a purpose-built layer that connects L1s, L2s, and L3s with near-instant finality and true scalability, which solves the fundamental issue with web3 applications: fragmentation. With the successful voting of the governance proposal, the Push Chain mission is now on its way toward building <strong>any chain, any user, and any app.</strong></p>

<p>All blockchains have proven particularly useful for specific apps and use cases. Bitcoin enabled smart money. Ethereum enabled innovations for DeFi. Solana enabled fast apps and meme culture. Several L2s and new L1s are targeting other areas of concern.</p>
<p>However, a blockchain that is purpose-built to enable chain abstraction and seamless interoperability in the space is still required. This chain would enable transactions from any chain (ETH, SOL, EVM or non-EVM) to power apps that can be used by <strong>any user —</strong> no matter their chain or wallet. This is the chain of <strong>Universal Apps</strong>. This is Push Chain!</p>

<p>Push Chain is revolutionary for both users and developers as it creates an environment for any developer to deploy their universal app in hours via a single universal smart contract deployment.</p>
<p>It also enables users to transact from the comfort, convenience, and choice of their ecosystem, no matter where the app resides.</p>
<p>Under the hood, this is achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to do <strong>transactions from any chain</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fee &amp; Wallet Abstraction</strong> (universal wallet + guest wallet)</li>
<li><strong>Shared State</strong> (read data from other blockchain) 👀</li>
<li><strong>Generalised Programmable Solve</strong>r (enables acting on the data read from other chains)</li>
<li><strong>Universal Smart Contract</strong> (enables devs to deploy universal interop apps in hours)</li>
<li><strong>Shared App Experience</strong> (any user from any chain can access any app of any chain)</li>
</ul>

<p>Push chain fits <strong>every project…</strong> <strong>on every chain!</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>It allows developers</strong> from any chain to create seamless full interop apps that can be used from any chain, via any wallet.<br>
- <strong>It allows users</strong> the freedom to interact with the wallet of their choice or have a seamless signless experience via Push Universal Wallet with social login.<br>
- <strong>It allows shared app experiences</strong> where users of all chains can come together and engage with Omni DeFi, Omni gaming, Omni NFT, Omni Governance, etc.<br></p>

<p>In the proposal, the Push Chain token is designed with multiple utilities that support the network's operation and growth.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Network Security</strong>: The token powers Push Chain’s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism through staking and slashing, ensuring the security and reliability of the network.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Fees</strong>: The token serves as the primary method for network fees for transactions and app usage.</li>
<li><strong>Governance</strong>: Token holders gain voting rights to propose and decide on protocol changes, actively contributing to the chain’s future.</li>
<li><strong>Fee Abstraction</strong>: Push’s Fee+Solver contract is used to enable users of any chain (whether ETH, SOL), etc to pay for gas via native token. A portion of the fee collected will be swapped and burned for Push Chain native token.</li>
<li><strong>Incentives</strong>: The token supports an ecosystem of rewards for validators, users, and community members through fee sharing and a reward system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Push Chain adopts a dynamic supply model, which is used among popular chains (like Ethereum and Solana). Post mainnet, new tokens for the chain would be mined solely for node rewards, relayer rewards, and other participants that are required for ensuring chain security, functionality, and decentralization needs.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="burn-and-deflationary-mechanism">Burn and Deflationary Mechanism<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-chain-tokenomics#burn-and-deflationary-mechanism" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Burn and Deflationary Mechanism" title="Direct link to Burn and Deflationary Mechanism">​</a></h3>
<p>Push Chain has a couple of burn mechanisms owing to it being a Universal Blockchain.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Native Chain Burn</strong>: A part of the fees is always burned when native transactions are done on Push Chain.</li>
<li><strong>Cross Chain Burn</strong>: Using Fee Abstractions, a part of the fee collected on other blockchain’s native token (ETH, SOL) is swapped for Push Chain native token and burned.</li>
</ol>
<p>This ensures a deflationary blockchain design that burns tokens as the network and the transactions that happen on it grow. This allows the chain to achieve deflationary tokenomics design while still awarding the validators and other actors. This design enables the creation of an incentivized, sustainable long-term future for Push Chain and all its participants.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="migration-details">Migration Details<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-chain-tokenomics#migration-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Migration Details" title="Direct link to Migration Details">​</a></h3>
<p>Push Chain is the result of years of learning from building the leading notification and communication protocol of web3, which was one of the first consumer apps for crypto.</p>
<p>Owing to this, apart from the airdrop allocated (see details below) to Push Chain users, creators, developers and ecosystem partners, <strong>there is also a migration drop reserved for the $PUSH holders</strong> (which was the native token of Push Protocol).</p>
<p><strong>For existing $PUSH token holders</strong>, the Push Chain tokenomics proposal allocates 15% of the total Push Chain token supply specifically for migration. The migration will occur at a ratio of <strong>1:15</strong>—meaning for each Push Protocol ($PUSH) token you hold, you'll receive 15 Push Chain tokens. For example, if you currently hold 40 $PUSH tokens, you'll receive 600 Push Chain tokens after migration.</p>
<p>The launch of Push Chain is designed to reward and incentivize prior Push Protocol ($PUSH) holders for their loyalty and contribution. The migration process for existing $PUSH token holders will work as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokens will migrate at a 1:15 ratio (1 Push Protocol token = 15 Push Chain tokens).</li>
<li>Participants in the Push Chain migration will see 50% of their migrated tokens unlocked immediately, and an additional 50% unlocked after 3 months.</li>
<li>Token migrators will also benefit from a dedicated yield farming pool reserved for them. These rewards will be distributed to token migrators if they stake their migrated Push Chain tokens, to reward them for long-term contribution to the ecosystem.</li>
<li>For example, if you have 100 Push Protocol $PUSH tokens, you’ll receive 750 Push Chain tokens when you migrate and 750 Push Chain tokens after 3 months — for a total of 1,500 Push Chain tokens. You can choose to stake these tokens to get additional rewards from the Push Chain yield farming pool, distributed periodically.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Push Chain token migration will be open for 12 months after launch, after which any remaining tokens will go to the community and ecosystem reserve.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="airdrop-details">Airdrop Details<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-chain-tokenomics#airdrop-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Airdrop Details" title="Direct link to Airdrop Details">​</a></h3>
<p>Additionally, the tokenomics proposal allocates 10% of the total Push Chain token supply for airdrops to past and present Push Protocol application users (notifications, messaging, chat). Along with new users, creators, developers, and ecosystem partners of Push Chain.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="token-distribution-details">Token Distribution Details<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-chain-tokenomics#token-distribution-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Token Distribution Details" title="Direct link to Token Distribution Details">​</a></h2>

<p><strong>Build super abstracted - shared settlement institutional and consumer DApps</strong></p>
<p>With shared settlement capabilities of Push Chain and Diamante - devs can build apps with powerful chain, fee and wallet abstraction capabilities - allowing transactions from any chain with near-instant finality.</p>
<p><strong>Build universally compliant consumer and mixed financial apps</strong></p>
<p>Push Chain introduces a new transaction type: <strong>‘consumer transactions’</strong>, where transaction ordering is not essential.</p>
<p>Why consumer tx?</p>
<p>Two major challenges hinder the scalability of consumer web3 apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chain Fragmentation-</strong> User bases are over-diversified across hundreds of chains, impeding user growth, UX and retention.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability constraints-</strong> Most chains process transactions in a strictly ordered manner, which imposes unnecessary constraints on apps that don’t rely on transaction ordering.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where Push Chain’s Consumer Tx feature enables non-financial and consumer applications to operate with lightning-fast speed and hyper-scalability. Push Chain enables these apps to manage millions of users seamlessly across any chain environment.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-curious">The Curious<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/another-l1#the-curious" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Curious" title="Direct link to The Curious">​</a></h3>
<p>At crypto conferences I'm often asked how our approach at Push differs from other L1 projects. And at normie gatherings I'm asked which crypto is best for starters. Until now I used to think of these as two distinct questions coming from two distinct audiences, i.e. technical and non-technical. My responses were conditioned by this assumption. At the former I used to talk about our '<a href="https://push.org/blog/innovations-by-push-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared state</a>' approach and how it is distinguishable from interoperability (more on that below and in subsequent articles). And to the normies I used to suggest that starting-points can be subjective because different projects are trying to do different things. Some for instance are building reliable forms of decentralised cash, while others are trying to democratise the financial system. Still others are trying to get social media out of the hands of big tech, and a lot of them are just having fun.</p>
<p>The problem with my approach was that it left out the real audience: the 'web3 curious'. This is a huge category which cannot be ignored, and I'm going to define it rather broadly as those people who have heard of crypto and played around with it a bit <a href="https://push.org/blog/why-push-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">without digging deeper</a>. You could say the real reason why they got into the whole thing was quick money. But in order for that to happen I feel they must <em>at some level believe</em> in the larger crypto project. To put it differently, <em>even if</em> they thought they were playing around with 'magic internet money', some part of them must have known that the magic was real (or had the potential of <em>becoming</em> real). That's the part of the collective psyche we need to reach.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="ecosystem-abstraction">Ecosystem Abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/another-l1#ecosystem-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Abstraction" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Abstraction">​</a></h3>
<p>To return to the earlier point, I now feel that both audiences were asking me the same thing in different ways, i.e. <em>which ecosystem?</em> It's often said that a few years in crypto equals decades in the real world. To me this was never a throwaway sentiment but a profound ground-truth about our industry. When crypto was just starting out people used to debate whether it had 'inherent value' and whether it could ever become 'money'. Those questions have more or less disappeared today because most people have concluded that it does. Thanks to the SEC, the critical regulatory question today seems to be whether a particular crypto is a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/08/14/how-the-secs-charge-that-cryptos-are-securities-could-face-an-uphill-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security</a> or not. But of course it took humanity more than a thousand years to get from money to finance.</p>
<p>The lesson we can draw from this is that the forms of '<a href="https://medium.com/@adamnite/a-history-of-crypto-tribalism-11f9f9c5cbaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crypto tribalism</a>' we see today are comparable to <a href="https://www.wideopenspaces.com/native-american-totem-animals-origins-totem-poles-meaning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historical tribes</a> who hitched their identity to particular totems and money-objects. We took a giant leap when we adopted the human-first-tribe-later perspective. This allowed us to <em>abstract away particular ecosystems</em> and develop a more global outlook. Of course I am not suggesting that our particular cultural attributes disappeared with modernity, but rather that they were preserved within a more <a href="https://www.notion.so/Is-Push-Chain-another-L1-188188aea7f4801a8e5dc22d0c20e0f3?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">'universal' wrapper</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="cities--bridges">Cities &amp; Bridges<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/another-l1#cities--bridges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cities &amp; Bridges" title="Direct link to Cities &amp; Bridges">​</a></h3>
<p>Simply put, ‘ecosystem abstraction’ is my general response to both questions posed above. I see it as <a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an ongoing process</a> that Push aims to accelerate -- comparable perhaps to globalisation which aims to overcome national boundaries -- rather than as a quantifiable end state. What this means in concrete terms is that we are building a non-competitive L1 that does not distinguish between normies and crypto-natives.</p>
<p>Why, you wonder? Because it’s the <a href="https://push.org/blog/what-is-consumer-crypto-and-why-does-it-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final ecosystem barrier</a> standing between us and mass adoption. Moreover, it allows us to approach technical problems with a fresh perspective. Consider interoperability. By and large it means two things in crypto: unifying different chains via bridges and developing common standards. The first is a necessary, but more importantly, <em>organic</em> approach because bridges between two parts of a city aren't built unless there is significant traffic between them. The trouble right now is that the two sides are run by different municipal authorities, and every time you have to cross between them you must take fresh authorisation from an agent who operates a toll booth.</p>
<p>Now if this were a real city the citizens would petition the Mayor and get things changed. They would most likely ask for a monthly ticket and some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘fast tag’</a> on their cars which could automatically calculate and deduct the toll-fees from their wallets. But crypto is decentralised and there is no Mayor to petition. So for us the only solution is to get both municipal authorities to agree on a system for quick and trustworthy communication. Moreover, if both sides have different ticketing systems then they would need to develop a common ticketing standard which is mutually recognised.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="necessity-led-invention">Necessity-led invention<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/another-l1#necessity-led-invention" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Necessity-led invention" title="Direct link to Necessity-led invention">​</a></h3>
<p>In crypto, the reason why interoperability is an especially difficult problem to crack is because it requires unbroken coordination and synchronicity between different ecosystems. With every new chain that is added to the mix, the patchwork expands and becomes more unwieldy. It is therefore legitimate for people to wonder whether we are ‘another L1’ which is ultimately going to increase this messiness.</p>
<p>The short answer is no: Push is not building its own separate municipality in its own corner of the city. Instead we are building systems (such as <a href="https://whitepaper.push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solver networks and fees quotas</a>) through which bridge-operators can communicate and coordinate. Imagine if a <a href="https://www.notion.so/189188aea7f480faaba5f80052406759?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tourist</a> was visiting the city and wanted to pass through three different bridges in a single drive. The bridge-operators would need to reach consensus on various things including: (a) does he have enough money for all the tolls? (2) is he a legitimate (non-malicious) actor, and (c) has he received necessary permissions from the respective Mayors of the source and destination cities, etc.</p>
<p>In the context of crypto these steps are reducible to verifiable cross-chain communications, and because Push has been working on this problem from its origin, it is uniquely positioned to create such a system. In other words, the move towards Push Chain was driven by the realisation that we had to do our bit to move the needle on interoperability, not in order to create our own fragmented ecosystem.</p>
<p>Personally, what is most exciting for me is thinking about the new use-cases that such a cross-chain-communication-grid unlocks. Imagine if an <em>Aurory</em> or <em>Star Atlas</em> player is able to leverage Uniswap or Polymarket through in-game intent solvers, or if an artist is able to launch NFTs of their work simultanously across Opensea, Magic Eden and Jpg.store. Here's how my friend and colleague Zee put it in a recent conversation: "we're trying to build systems where people can use their favourite apps on their favourite chains without friction or second thought."</p>
<p>Yes it's an ambitious road, but we're determined.</p>
