And just in time for the $PUSH token sale and the EPNS mainnet launch! \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\n_\ud83c\udfa8_ Today, we\u2019re excited to unveil our NFT collection **$ROCKSTARS of EPNS*.*** The collection is a series of 100 illustrations by commissioned Indian artists. \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 The NFT will be released in two phases: the initial gratitude drop, and the following weekly drop.\\n\\n![First Image of The First NFT Collection from EPNS!](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n**Gratitude drop.** Recently, we announced our [TGE](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/announcing-the-epns-push-token-generation-event-4d1699e716f5) and our intention to airdrop $PUSH to members of the community who supported us through Gitcoin Grants Round 6,7 and being part of the EPNS testnet beta. Our gratitude doesn\u2019t stop there, though! There have been many advisors, consultants, and guides who have gotten us to this day through countless hours of strategy discussions and meetings. The first NFT drop will go to 48 of these individuals \u2014 we\u2019ll reach out to you on Twitter to send you your NFT if you\u2019re one of them!).\\n\\n**Weekly drop.** The remaining 52 NFTs will be gifted to members of the community over the course of the next year. Every Monday, we\u2019ll give one EPNS NFT to a community member who has been a particular fan, supporter, and evangelist of the EPNS protocol. 1 per week until we celebrate our one year anniversary at this same time next year. We even hope to collaborate with other projects in the space to gift special partner NFTs! Keep an eye out for the rules and how to throw your hat in the ring \u2014 coming soon!\\n\\nTo our community \u2014 thank you! We\u2019re excited to have arrived at this moment. We cannot wait to launch EPNS on the Ethereum mainnet soon and start delivering decentralized notifications for all.\\n\\nSo how can you throw your hat in the ring? We\u2019d love to hear from you; feedback about the protocol, the applications, support online, participation in community channels, and more!"}}')}}]);
