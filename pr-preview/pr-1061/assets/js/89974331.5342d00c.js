But these states are siloed within their respective chains, even <i>within the same ecosystem.</i>\\n\\nFor example, a wallet\'s ETH balance on Ethereum differs from its ETH balance on Base because each of these chains maintains its own state.\\n\\nFor building universal apps we need to:\\n- <b>Read</b> states from other chains (e.g., balances, smart contract data).\\n- <b>Write</b> to all chains, and\\n- <b>Support wallets</b> across all networks.\\n\\n\\nThe first of these innovations -- i.e. the ability of developers on Push Chain <i>to read and utilise the state of other chains via smart contracts</i> -- is what we mean by a <b>shared-state blockchain.</b>\\n\\n## Apps that are only possible with Shared States:\\n### 1) Competitive Cross Chain Gaming\\n\\n<b>Shared-state makes \u2018chain wars\u2019 real!</b>\\nIt allows players from any blockchain ecosystem to come together and play their favourite games with (or against) each other by leveraging Push Chain as a shared settlement layer.\\n\\nThink \u2018[Universal Chess](https://chess.push.org)\u2019 tournaments between Ethereum and Solana tribes, with a cross-chain betting widget for viewers and game NFTs for players. The perfect degen chess experience!\\n\\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. Think Poker, Blackjack, Monopoly, RPGs and more, available to and accessible by users of all chains!\\n\\nBy removing the biggest barriers to on-chain game adoption, i.e. UX and asset fragmentation, <b>Push Chain allows gamers to bring their chain-specific identities to chain-neutral playgrounds.</b>\\n\\n![Third Image of Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.2](./image-3.webp)\\n\\n\\n#### \ud83c\udf0cWhat this enables:\\n- Game developers can design experiences for the entire web3 userbase.\\n- Chain agnostic user onboarding - users can join from any chain they already use.\\n- <b>Unified cross-chain identities</b>: Users can pause/save a game on one chain, and continue from the same checkpoint on another chain.\\n e.g., Player 2 moves to Arbitrum but keeps their character\'s skills and assets intact.\\n- Multiplayer games can allow users to join from any chain, or switch in the middle without losing access to their points and/or in-game assets.\\n\\n\\n#### \ud83e\udd14Why it needs shared state:\\n- Chain-neutral playgrounds require seamless state synchronizations, player state to be unified in one trusted environment - in order to track individual as well as relational game data (points, damage, skills, assets etc.).\\n- Without shared-state, cross-chain games would need <b>custom bridges</b> and complex game synchronization measures per game, which would be expensive and damaging for the UX.\\n\\n### 2) Multichain DAOs\\nProtocol tokens are increasingly becoming available cross-chain. For example, Uniswap\u2019s UNI exists on Ethereum, Polygon and Base among others. <b>With shared-state, apps can aggregate a member\u2019s voting power across chains by reading and bundling his tokens.</b>\\n\\n#### \ud83c\udf0c What this enables:\\n- DAOs can launch tokens <b>across multiple chains</b> without fracturing governance.\\n- The community can participate in decentralized decision-making through <b>cross-chain coordination</b> (e.g. delegated votes, comments on proposals, commitment pools, temperature checks etc.)\\n\\n#### \ud83e\udd14Why it needs shared-state:\\n- \u2018Voting power\u2019 is a combined function of a protocol\u2019s real and synthetic assets held across chains.\\n\\n### 3) Universal AI Agents:\\n\\nShared state capabilities of Push Chain act as the missing coordination layer for enabling universal AI agents to operate across multiple independent chains autonomously, reliably, and with a unified memory.\\n\\n#### \ud83c\udf0cWhat this enables:\\nBuild <b>chain-agnostic AI agents</b> that can:\\n- Read user states, assets, activities, and preferences across all chains.\\n- Act on behalf of users without needing users to bridge, switch wallets, or manually interact with dApps.\\n- Maintains a <b>persistent universal context</b> across chains, apps, and experiences.\\n\\n<b>Ex: Personal Finance Assistant Agent:</b>\\n\\n![Fourth Image of Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.2](./image-4.webp)\\n\\n\\n- Reads the user\'s balances across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Solana.\\n- Notices idle assets on Base and recommends moving them into a higher-yield protocol on Polygon.\\n- Automatically constructs and <b>executes a cross-chain investment action</b> via Push Chain\'s programmable solvers.\\n\\n#### \ud83e\udd14Why it needs shared-state:\\n- Unified State Access: AI agents need real-time visibility into user balances, transactions, and positions <b>across all chains.</b>\\n\\n\\n### 4) Universal (Multi-chain) Safes\\nToday, managing assets across multiple chains is a logistical nightmare.\\n\\nUsers must juggle separate wallets, track balances individually, and manually bridge funds \u2014 a process that\u2019s both error-prone and inefficient. While \u2018safes\u2019 are a reliable way for groups to pool and manage assets (e.g. for DAOs, investment clubs, or even families), they face additional challenges due to multisig barriers.\\n\\nShared-state solves this by enabling <b>safes with multi-chain signers</b>, i.e. chain-agnostic vaults that can natively pool, manage and utilise assets across all chains.\\n\\nThis turns the chaos of fragmented assets into a streamlined, interoperable system \u2014 for individuals, DAOs, and institutions. With shared-state, Push Chain makes cross-chain asset-management as simple as using a single shared wallet.\\n\\n#### \ud83c\udf0c What it enables:\\n\\n##### Unified Asset Management\\n- Users can deposit assets from any chain (e.g., ETH on Ethereum, SOL on Solana, GNO on Gnosis) into a single safe, with real-time visibility of their total portfolio.\\n- Groups (DAOs, hedge funds, guilds) can collectively manage cross-chain treasuries without requiring manual bridging or chain-specific multisigs.\\n\\n##### Conditional Cross-Chain Spending\\n- Define rules like: \\"Allow withdrawals only if 3/5 signers approve, and only up to 10% of the safe\'s TVA (Total Value Across chains).\\"\\n- Automate cross-chain rebalancing (e.g., \\"If $CLANKER on Base drops below 20% of the safe\'s TVA, sell $TRUMP on Solana to equalize\\").\\n\\n##### Shared Ownership Without Bridging\\n- A DAO can hold ETH on Ethereum, stSOL on Solana, and USDC on Base \u2014 all in the same safe, governed by the same rules.\\n- Families or investment clubs can pool assets across chains while maintaining granular permissions (e.g., \\"Kids can only spend from the Optimism portion\\").\\n\\n##### Cross-Chain Inheritance & Recovery\\n- Set up programmable inheritance (e.g., \\"If inactive for 12 months, transfer all assets \u2014 regardless of chain \u2014 to this backup wallet\\").\\n- Social recovery mechanisms can pull verification from multiple chains (e.g., \\"Recover safe if 5/7 friends from Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon sign\\").\\n\\n![Fifth Image of Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.2](./image-5.webp)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Why it needs shared-state:\\n##### Real-Time Portfolio Tracking\\n- A safe\u2019s TVA (Total Value Across chains) can only be calculated if the contract can read balances from all connected chains.\\n- Without shared-state, we\u2019d need to manually bridge assets to a single chain\u2014defeating the purpose of a true \u2018multi-chain\u2019 safe.\\n\\n##### Cross-Chain Transaction Execution\\n- Spending from a multi-chain safe requires verifying ownership and permissions across chains (e.g., \\"Does this wallet have approval on Ethereum to trigger a withdrawal on Solana?\\").\\n- Shared-state enables this via atomic cross-chain actions (e.g., selling ETH on Arbitrum to buy SOL on Solana in one transaction).\\n\\n##### Dynamic Rule Enforcement\\n- Conditions like \\"Only spend if the safe\u2019s total stablecoin holdings exceed $1M\\" require aggregating balances from multiple chains.\\n- Recovery mechanisms need to verify on-chain activity (e.g., \\"Check last transaction timestamps on all chains before triggering inheritance\\").\\n\\n\\n### 5) Embeddable Prediction Markets\\n\\nPrediction markets are great tools for building alignment, coordination and conviction within groups. They can unlock a bunch of utility when combined with other on-chain activities such as DeFi, voting, gaming and content creation.\\n\\nToday, however, they operate as isolated betting shops which are limited to specific chains, acceptable tokens and capacity to verify events (off or on-chain).\\n\\n<b>Shared-state changes all of this.</b>\\n\\nPush Chain enables <b>universally embeddable prediction markets</b> that can be attached to any cross-chain app, game, or event and can be used by users from any chain and any token.\\n\\nSeamless routing liquidity across chains, without bridging.\\n\\nThus, turning fragmented cross-chain activities into a unified playground for probabilistic thinking.\\n\\n#### \ud83c\udf0cWhat this enables:\\n##### App-based prediction widgets: developers can create internal markets that can be attached to any cross-chain app, game, or events:\\n- e.g.: during a board/card game on one chain, a widget allows viewers from any chain to create \u2018internal bets\u2019:\\na. on the outcome of the game,\\nb. on specific moves/cards,\\n\\n\\n##### Event-driven derivatives: time-sensitive markets that spin up whenever certain conditions are met:\\n- e.g. for the duration of Trump\u2019s golf game, will the price of $Trump rise or fall? (Such a market can be programmed to spin up automatically on credible news of Trump playing golf, and disappear when the game ends).\\n\\n##### Deeper community engagement: Local prediction markets embedded in apps = high engagement attraction.\\n\\n\\n![Sixth Image of Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.2](./image-6.webp)\\n\\n\\n<b>\ud83e\udd14Why it needs shared-state:</b>\\n- Markets must read real-time data from multiple chains (DEX volumes, social data, oracles).\\n- <b>Cross-chain settlement proofs</b> are required to resolve outcomes trustlessly.\\n- Dynamic odds calculation requires unified liquidity across all prediction pools.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## End Game\\n\\nPush Chain\u2019s shared-state architecture finally delivers <b>the universal blockchain trifecta</b> \u2014 unifying user needs, developer needs, and cross-chain data unification \u2013 all in a single layer.\\n\\nFor users, it leads to seamless cross-chain interactions: no more juggling bridges, fragmented balances or chain-locked assets. Your entire on-chain identity \u2014 DeFi positions, NFTs, agentic memories, game assets etc. \u2014 becomes portable and composable across all networks.\\n\\nFor developers, shared-state unlocks an entirely new paradigm: read and unify fragmented assets without worrying about latency, cost, security or interoperability.\\n\\n<b>\\nSeriously.. <br />\\nWhy build for one chain <br />\\nWhen you could build for them all? <br />\\n</b>"},{"id":"apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-06-apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-vol1/index.md","title":"Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.1","description":"Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.1","date":"2025-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 6, 2025","tags":[{"label":"Push Chain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-chain"},{"label":"Deep dives","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/deep-dives"},{"label":"Shared App Experience","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/shared-app-experience"},{"label":"Shared State Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/shared-state-blockchain"},{"label":"Universal Smart Contracts","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/universal-smart-contracts"}],"readingTime":6.443333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v1","title":"Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.1","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.1","text":"Learn about 5 super helpful use cases that are only only possible with shared state blockchains like Push Chain","tags":["Push Chain","Deep dives","Shared App Experience","Shared State Blockchain","Universal Smart Contracts"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.2","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/apps-only-possible-with-shared-state-v2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Interop as a Spectrum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/interop-spectrum"}},"content":"![Cover Image of Apps Possible Only with Shared State - Vol.1](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nCrypto has come a long way.\\nAnd so has the extent of innovations that continue to make this space more adaptive, smooooth and fun!\\n\\n\\nHere are 5 super innovative use cases the industry could immensely benefit from using Shared State chains like Push Chain.\\n\\nThese use cases cover various bases, including but not limited to Defi, Degen Defi(iykyk), Art, Airdrops, DAOs and even Gaming.\\n\\n\\n## What is Push Chain?\\n\\nPush Chain is an all-purpose universal chain that unites every existing and forthcoming chain together (under one roof).\\n\\n**It is a shared-state L1 blockchain designed to function as a universal app layer for users across any chain, any wallet and any app.**\\n\\nCombining this with the innovation of cross-chain fees and wallet abstraction, what you get is a **blockchain able to read any other chain and\u2026 is accessible by users from any chain.**\\n\\n![push chain vein diagram](./image1.webp)\\n\\n## What is a \'shared state\' blockchain?\\n\\n![shared state overview](./image2.webp)\\n\\nAt its core, a blockchain maintains a database tracking the state of all wallets and smart contracts (token balances, data, code, etc.). But these states are siloed within their respective chains, even within the same ecosystem.\\n\\nFor example, a wallet\'s ETH balance on Ethereum differs from its ETH balance on Base because each of these chains maintains its own state.\\n\\nFor building universal apps we need to:\\n\\n- **Read** states from other chains (e.g., balances, smart contract data).\\n- **Write** to all chains, and\\n- **Support** **wallets** across all networks.\\n\\nThe first of these innovations -- i.e. the ability of developers on Push Chain *to read and utilise the state of other chains* via smart contracts -- is what we mean by a **shared-state blockchain**.\\n\\n## What kind of apps does this enable?\\n\\n![movie reference 1](./image3.webp)\\n\\n### 1. Universal DeFi & Payments\\n\\nDeFi today is fractured by:\\n1. chain-bound liquidity,\\n2. cumbersome bridging,\\n3. and inconsistent pricing.\\n\\nOur shared-state model tackles these problems by **unifying access to assets and data across all networks.**\\n\\n**For example:**\\n\\nUsing cross-chain price oracles, our apps can aggregate real-time ETH/USD rates from Ethereum, Solana and Base, creating a more robust and manipulation-resistant feed. This ensures fair and accurate pricing data for both DeFi and payments.\\n\\nSimilarly, shared-state enables **universal payment executors** that can combine a payee\u2019s balances from different chains, and calculate optimum routes for fulfilling merchant requests irrespective of the chain they\u2019re on.\\n\\nIn the traditional web3 world, if a payee (like a merchant) wants to receive a payment, they usually specify:\\n\\n- A chain (e.g. \u201cSend to Ethereum\u201d),\\n- A token (e.g. \u201cSend USDC\u201d), and\\n- An address (e.g. their ETH address).\\n\\n**This limits:**\\n\\n1. Which chain the payer can use.\\n2. What token they must use.\\n3. Operational comfort that forces bridging or manual swaps.\\n\\n### ***What this enables***\\n\\n- **Stripe-like cross-chain payments:**\\n    - e.g. payee\u2019s wallet can read real-time asset values from multiple sources and pool them for atomic settlement.\\n\\n    ![cross chain payments overview](./image4.webp)\\n\\n    \x3c!-- diagram 2 --\x3e\\n    \x3c!-- Caption - With Push Chain payer can pool sums from multiple wallets and fulfil the payment in one single transaction. --\x3e\\n\\n\\n- Seamless cross-chain trades with novel features like:\\n    - **Collateral management**\\n        - e.g. a user opens a leveraged position on Solana using ETH as collateral, but he also has some ETH on other chains like Arbitrum and BNB.\\n        - A shared-state app can read its balances and combine them to create a **unified collateral** **pool,** which can be used across all chains without bridging.\\n    - **Liquidation protection**\\n        - e.g. if the ETH price drops by a higher percentage on Solana compared to other chains, a **shared-state liquidation protector** can:\\n            - Unlock balances on Arbitrum and BNB to balance the trade, and/or\\n            - Consult other sources (DEXes, oracles etc.) to calculate the average drop and forestall a liquidation event.\\n\\n\\n### ***Why it needs shared-state***\\n\\n- Payment routing requires real-time asset and price checks across chains.\\n- Finding and executing an optimal payment route across payers\' wallets from different chains requires reading all the states.\\n- Collateral managers and liquidation protectors cannot link different balances to the same user without fetching the state.\\n- Price oracles need to aggregate and verify data from multiple sources.\\n\\n### 2. Yield Aggregators\\n\\nShared-state apps built on Push Chain can also function as **universal yield aggregators**. They can collect and show APYs from various chains, allowing the user to execute the most profitable staking transactions across any network without worrying about native reconversions or swaps.\\n\\n\\n### ***What this enables***\\n\\n- Users are no longer tied to a particular blockchain or ecosystem to earn yields on their stablecoins or assets (whether native or foreign). True unchained universal yields.\\n- Their **aggregated yield routing** enables optimal capital allocation across protocols, minimizing fragmentation and maximizing APY\\n- **Universal Liquid Staking Tokens** (ULSTs) can be created by combining and/or hybridizing existing ones (e.g. stETH, rETH, mSOL).\\n\\n![movie reference 2](./image5.webp)\\n\\n### ***Why it needs shared-state***\\n\\n- Yields are a dynamic function of various on-chain data points (e.g. total staked supply, network inflation rules, validator slashing and reward metrics, gas fees and MEV protections). Their aggregation is impossible without accurate and verifiable cross-chain read capabilities.\\n- Combined capital and ULSTs require proof of ownership of underlying assets.\\n\\n### 3. Customizable Universal Exchanges\\n\\nA customizable universal exchange is one where you can trade any asset (fungible or non-fungible) against any other asset on any chain, with no need for both assets to exist in the same chain.\\n\\nCurrently, \u2018trading pairs\u2019 on exchanges are limited to recognized tokens, which have two limitations:\\n\\n- It adds a permissioning layer (good from a security perspective, but limits censorship resistance);\\n- In an age where everything is being \u2018tokenized\u2019, it is necessary to create permissionless exchanges for customizable trading pairs.\\n\\n\\n### ***What this enables***\\n\\n- With shared-state, apps can let users create their own custom exchange options, like an **e-bay for on-chain assets:**\\n    - e.g. \u201cwilling to sell pudgy penguin NFT#44 for 100,000 $SHIB\u201d.\\n    - Buyers and sellers can be connected through **intent matching games like a cross-chain asset barter system**:\\n        - e.g. someone \u2018willing to sell all his coins on Solana for two popular NFTs on Ethereum\u2019 may be notified of the above trade\\n\\n![movie reference 3](./image6.webp)\\n\\n### ***Why it needs shared-state***\\n\\n- Accurate intent matching can occur only when the app has a holistic view of all the assets held by both parties.\\n- Push Chain\u2019s shared state module allows-\\n    - Read wallet balances, token IDs, traits, or metadata across chains.\\n    - Validate offers without bridging or duplicating contracts on other chains.\\n    - Coordinate solver execution for complex multi-chain settlement.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Want to experience Universal DEXs?*\\n\\n*Stay tuned for **Push Chain Testnet V1***\\n\\n*Coming very soon\u2026*\\n\\n\\n### 4 Universal Airdrops\\n\\nTraditionally, Airdrops are localized to a specific chain(Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum etc). The eligibility checks usually work only within the chain of the drop.\\n\\nShared-state chains like Push Chain allow us to query on-chain data from different chains, enabling the flexibility for crafting complex eligibility conditions spanning ecosystems, in a very convenient and unified manner.\\n\\n***For example:***\\n\\n**Cross-Chain Game Drop:**\\n\\nA project launches a new gaming token.\\n\\nEligibility conditions:\\n\\n- Played at least A,B,C games on Sonic SVM,\\n- Bought a [Pudgy Penguin](https://pudgypenguins.com/) or Lil Pudgy NFT on Ethereum,\\n- Used Phantom Wallet,\\n- Participated in a Gitcoin grant on Ethereum.\\n\\n\x3c!-- Diagram 3 --\x3e\\n![cross chain airdrop overivew](./image7.webp)\\n\\n\\nA **universal drop,** in this case, can:\\n\\n- Verify these diverse activities via shared-state reads.\\n- Allow claiming the gaming token on Polygon, Solana, or Ethereum - whichever the user prefers.\\n\\n### ***What this enables***\\n\\n- Custom cross-chain algorithms for drop eligibility:\\n    - e.g. filter wallets that have played a game on Arbitrum, participated in Gitcoin Grants via Celo, minted 2 NFTs on Solana and 3 content coins on Zora, over the last year.\\n- Launching a DeFi app? Design an airdrop for DeFi users across all chains to attract them to your platform.\\n- Eligibility verifications and claims from any chain to any chain.\\n\\n### ***Why it needs shared-state***\\n\\n- Eligibility verification requires **live access** to wallet activity across multiple chains.\\n- Without shared-state, projects must deploy separate scripts/contracts/oracles per chain, leading to fragmentation, delays, and higher infra costs.\\n\\n\\n### 5 Universal NFTs\\n\\nToday\u2019s NFTs are trapped in single-chain ecosystems with rigid formats. (An NFT on Ethereum can\u2019t natively interact with Solana or Aptos.).\\n\\nIt is virtually unheard of to have an NFT on one chain with its tokens on another (although projects such as Pudgy Penguins are pioneering this approach).\\n\\nMoreover, at present, an NFT can neither be launched on different chains at once, nor can its attributes be natively read from them.\\n\\nPush Chain redefines NFTs as **dynamic,chain-agnostic digital primitives** - assets whose ownership, metadata, and modes of expression can **live and evolve across multiple chains** simultaneously.\\n\\n### ***What this enables***\\n\\nThis not only makes them *universal* (i.e.\xa0 capable of existing natively on all chains) but also gives them additional cross-chain features such as:\\n\\n- ***Conditionality**:* the ownership of an asset (or attribute) can be made conditional on custom cross-chain logics, for example:\\n    - \u201cDynamically transfer the ownership of this NFT to a wallet on Solana that has the highest degen points on Base.\u201d\\n    - \u201cIf the price of this token reaches 1$ on Cosmos, fractionalize it into 100 pieces and distribute them to wallets with the highest 24 hr trading volume on Aptos.\u201d\\n- ***Multimodality***: the same NFT can exist as a 2D image on Ethereum, a video on Base, a song on Solana, a narrative on Scroll and a 3D model on Arbitrum.\\n- ***Organicity***: it can evolve across formats, for example:\\n    - A digital artwork could start as a static image which could give rise to a community-owned narrative;\\n    - As this narrative grows, the root image can give rise to distinct animation layers, each with its own set of owners.\\n- ***Portability***: Ownership of an NFT can act as portable proof across chains.\\n\\n### ***Why it needs shared-state***\\n\\n- In order for an NFT to be truly \u201cnon-fungible\u201d across chains, the same user (or contract) must be able to provide reliable proofs of ownership from any chain to any chain.\\n- Reading and writing of NFT metadata across chains.\\n- Elimination of artificial \\"chain walls\\" that restrict creative evolution.\\n\\n## End Game\\n\\nPush Chain\u2019s shared-state architecture finally delivers **the universal blockchain trifecta** - unifying user needs, developer needs, and cross-chain data unification - all in a single layer.\\n\\nFor users, it leads to seamless cross-chain interactions: no more juggling bridges, fragmented balances or chain-locked assets.

This is because it\'s like a path on which the perfect destination is difficult to find, and there are tons of design choices, learning curves as well as UX compromises along the way.\\n\\nAttempts to \'solve\' interop within these constraints has led to a variety of solutions.\\n\\nIn this article, we provide a general overview of these approaches and show how they are all interconnected. We also highlight how the meaning of interop has shifted as the web3 industry has matured and expanded, and outline a possible endgame.\\n\\nBefore we get to that, i.e. full stack interoperability, we will discuss how interop started and, more importantly, why it should be viewed as a spectrum rather than a binary \u20180\u2019 or \u20181\u2018. In reality, interop and the desire to defragment has been with us from the moment Bitcoin on/off-ramp came to existence!\\n\\n## The Interop Spectrum\\n\\n### 1. The First Interop - Centralized Exchanges\\n\\nThe desire for an interoperable and defragmented web3 has been with us ever since the first Bitcoin on/off-ramp took off. No sooner did it come into existence than our desire to make it tradable with traditional finance (TradFi) arose. This need was further deepened with the rise of other layer 1s such as Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano etc.\\n\\nThe user\'s need was clear: a unified interface which allowed the trading of different crypto assets directly and instantly. Centralised exchanges (CEXs) arose to fulfil this need. They abstracted away the complexity of different chains from the frontend at the cost of introducing trust assumptions and centralisation at the backend.\\n\\nThis era saw the origin of many CEXs, some of which have since disappeared (such as Mt. Gox), and others that have become household crypto names (such as Coinbase and Binance). While this worked for the users who wanted convenience, it also exposed issues with centralizing decentralized assets, giving us the next problem we had to tackle.\\n\\nThe Progressive Problem - CEXs, with their centralized custody, opened up new issues for crypto and web3. Most of them arose from the very nature of custodial design which included exchanges getting hacked, users getting locked out or losing time before getting their funds and of course, the rare but not uncommon issue of exchange founders vanishing with keys that custodied the user funds.\\n\\nThis led us, the web3 collective, to work towards solving these issues which resulted in the **next iterative innovation** in chasing interop. A solution known as **atomic swaps** - a method by which two chains could perform a trustless exchange.\\n\\n### 2. Atomic Swaps - Hashlock time contracts between compatible chains\\n\\nAtomic swaps were so named because they turned a \'swap\' into a self-contained unit of operations on smart contracts which would succeed or fail as a bundle. This was done to prevent situations in which one side fulfils its side of the bargain but the other does not. We will later see how this idea of \'atomicity\' survives to this day in solver networks.\\n\\nProposed on a Bitcoin forum in 2013 as \'hash-time locked contracts\' (HTLCs), the first iteration of atomic swaps involved two smart contracts (one each on the source and destination chains) operating together to form a digital escrow with a shared secret.\\n\\nWhat makes them historically significant is that they were the first peer-to-peer chain-agnostic interop solution. Initially, they unified the interop design space by showing that trustless cross-chain swaps were possible between all ecosystems. Over time, however, they resulted in a new round of competition between \'HTLC compatible\' chains.\\n\\n**The Progressive Problem** - Despite being peer-to-peer, HTLCs were unable to \'solve\' the interop problem due to two important limitations: (a) They involved multiple transactions leading to scalability challenges. (b) Different blockchains had their own standards which were not compatible.\\n\\nThese bottlenecks led to the **next iterative innovations**: in the form of **decentralised exchanges** (DEXs) and **multi-chain wallets**.\\n\\n### 3. Local Interop and non-custodial solutions\\n\\n#### 3.1 Local Interop via DEXs\\n\\nThis breakthrough was led by Uniswap, which later pioneered not only decentralized finance (DeFi) but also kicked off the era of web3 apps. Its key innovation was to replace centralised orderbooks with automated market making algorithms (AMMs) and decentralised liquidity pools. This solved a lot of problems for advanced web3 users as they could conduct asset swaps directly from their wallets (yes if you used Metamask back then, you were an advanced user!).\\n\\nTechnically speaking, such systems suffered from two fundamental limitations: (a) They required knowledge of how particular blockchains work (for instance, ERC-20 token function calls of Approve and Transfer was not something an average joe understood). (b) They were limited to their own chains.\\n\\n#### 3.2 Multi-Chain Wallets\\n\\nAround the same time, crypto wallets emerged that offered the convenience of self-custody, i.e., the ability to store tokens outside the ambit of exchanges. Although bulk of the trading still took place on CEXs, the user now had the option of using non-custodial wallets which could be standalone (e.g. Metamask, Electron) or multi-chain (e.g. Exodus, Trust).\\n\\n**The Progressive Problem** - Even with DEXs and multi-chain wallets, problems with swapping between different chains remained. At the same time, EVMs were going through countless innovations and purpose built L2 chains started propping up.\\n\\nThis led to the **next iterative innovation**, i.e. **Bridging**, which usually followed a \u2018Lock and Mint\u2019 solution. A standard on Cosmos also became popular in this time known as IBC(Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol).\\n\\n### 4. Bridging to solve Interop between chains\\n\\nBridging was an excellent solution, albeit not without its own set of issues. It aimed to tackle moving funds between chains by first locking them on a smart contract and then using a set of validators, attesting and releasing the funds on other chains.\\n\\nAs is the nature of permissionless technologies, countless innovations emerged in parallel. We will consider the two main ones. First, trusted or semi-trusted bridging, which was how BTC was locked to mint WBTC, with minting being handled by a trusted set of custodians (WBTC DAO).\\n\\nSecond, which became the successor and was largely adopted in the industry was trustless bridging, involving a set of nodes attesting to the asset movement between chains. Some of the popular bridging solutions that we got were:\\n\\n- **Wormhole**, where you locked your token on one chain and released it on another chain, the caveat being that as a developer, you had to tweak your smart contracts and bridging was usually slow. But this also meant locking all funds on one smart contract on a chain which opened a couple of attack vectors such as smart contract vulnerabilities or oracle manipulations, etc.\\n- **IBC**, which required running light clients on both the chains, which handled proof verification before moving funds; though this was limited mainly to Cosmos or required oracles with light node smart contracts on non-Cosmos chains to function leading to adaptation limited to only the Cosmos ecosystem.\\n- **ZK Proofs** and **Optimistic Proofs** that ensured Ethereum L1 to L2s transfer which were quite fast but at times expensive to compute or required several days of challenge period to escape (revert) back to L1.\\n\\n**The Progressive Problem** - Bridging solved the trustlessness problem to an extent but largely was slow, forcing users to wait between movements or were fragmented or limited to a few eco-systems of chains.\\n\\nThis led to the **next iterative innovation**, which is known as the intent-solver system. In which an off-chain operator takes the risk (in exchange for a fee) for offering convenience and speed for moving funds across chains.\\n\\n### 5. Intent Solvers Networks - Bridging on Steroids\\n\\nWith intent solver networks, we have entered the current era of interop solutions. They are arguably the biggest improvement we have seen since the days of CEXs.\\n\\nThe way they work is quite novel: instead of bridging (that requires trusted validators or decentralized validators to slowly attest and then move funds) they flip the attestation and risk away from the smart contract (used to lock and mint in bridges) and gives it to off-chain specialized actors that almost instantly fill the user\u2019s intent(bridging, trading of assets, etc) using their own liquidity.\\n\\nThis feature works in the following way: :\\n\\n- The user provides their intent such as \u201cswap minimum ETH for USDT on Base\u201d or \u201cSwap SOL for minimum USDT on Ethereum\u201d.\\n- Along with this, the user either deposits assets, plus a small fee for solvers on a smart contract on the source chain or approves the assets to be used off-chain (mostly after they have already called approve on that app-specific smart contract).\\n- These instructions are then taken to a solver network, which, in the simplest terms are made of single off-chain actors that at least have the desired asset liquidity on the destination chain.\\n- The network then does an auction of sorts, which can be based on speed or cost. One popular auction mechanism done over is reverse Dutch auction, where the fee starts from the maximum point that will be paid and these off-chain solvers each bid a fee to win the auction. In the end, the lowest fee solver wins the bid and is tasked with fulfilling the intent.\\n- All of this takes less than a few seconds to be completed, after which the solver fulfils the obligation using its own liquidity on the destination chain, ensuring that the user gets their funds lightning fast.\\n- Later on, the solver submits the proof on the source smart contract, which mostly uses oracles to verify that the solver has done their job and then subsequently releases the funds to them.\\n\\nThis approach improves speed (typically happens within a few seconds), eliminates the attack vector of a single bloated smart contract worth millions of dollars, and is also scalable. But it does not (yet) mean that we have a magic bullet for web3 interop.\\n\\n**The Progressive Problem** - The main problem with such networks is that they require a high degree of specialisation with unclear incentives for participation (e.g. solvers would much rather become liquidity providers and earn more). They may also be app-controlled which can lead to vendor lock-in, or highly function-specific which can result in avoidable coordination costs.\\n\\nFurthermore, they need a reliable infrastructure on the app side (such as an oracle network) in order to determine the best trade routes. Even the simplest intents require precise and up to date knowledge of prices, a problem which is compounded as more chains get involved. And finally, there\'s the problem of liquidity pool coordination and rebalancing, which creates additional risk and complexity.\\n\\nThese problems have led us to design a new approach or the **next iterative innovation** keeping with the spirits of this article. We are terming them as \'**generalised programmable solvers\'** that can optimise, eliminate added infra and execute any custom routes which might be required by any developers of any app.\\n\\n### 6. Generalized Programmable Solvers - Solvers that are smarter, co-ordinated and generalized\\n\\n**Programmable solvers** is a term that we have coined at Push Chain to distinguish the next step in innovation that the solvers require to work at scale.\\n\\nAt its simplest, it means that developers will have shared state access to other blockchains, i.e. the ability to read, fetch and utilise the state of other chains. This will allow them to create custom pathways for fulfilling intents, all from a single universal EVM smart contract deployed on Push Chain.\\n\\n\\n![Universal Smart Contract Example (Pseudocode)](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n\\nThis approach solves a lot of issues that hamper the adoption of solvers in web3. In particular:\\n\\n- **Eliminates the need for having an external oracle or underlying infrastructure**: Shared state within Push Chain enables developers to logically code what their solvers need to do given different circumstances.\\n\\nFor example, if someone wants to swap $TRUMP from Solana and they have USDT on BNB, they will be able to read the BNB-USDT value from PancakeSwap, the SOL-USDT value from Raydium, and thus calculate the $TRUMP-USDT value from Raydium; all from a single smart contract deployed on Push Chain!\\n\\nOnce you have these values, just provide basic(atomic) solver instructions from your smart contract (still on Push Chain) and then let the solver network do its magic.\\n\\n- **Enables anyone to be a solver / solves LP co-ordination:** Once the solver network has a basic path, anyone can simply choose to run a basic solver software instead of creating a specialized one as the basic path is already provided. Though this doesn\u2019t stop specialized solvers as they can then optimize the pathway by creating their own custom logic. The Solver network is now for everyone, instead of a few specialized actors.\\n- **Allows specialized solvers pooling**: Since the path can consist of different atomic steps \u2013 in the above example: swapping, bridging, protocol interaction \u2013 each one of these can be provided to action-specific specialized solvers, further solving the co-ordination issue.\\n- **Enables any app to use solver network and be fully interoperable**: Since all the functionalities are driven by a single universal smart contract deployed by the developer on Push Chain, the interop solution is now developer friendly, no matter what apps they are creating. Furthermore, it can be deployed in hours if not minutes!\\n\\n**The Progressive Problem** - The only problem this solution doesn\u2019t address is the burden it places on the user to come to Push Chain to leverage the solution.\\n\\nWhich, of course, brings us to the **next and final iterative solution - Full Stack Interop**.\\n\\n### 7. Full Stack Interop - Push Chain (Universal L1)\\n\\n\\n![Image](./image-3.webp)\\n\\n\\nPush Chain which is a universal L1 chain offers full stack interop to enable a synergetic, unified web3, where **any apps** of **any chain** become accessible by **any user or wallet** of any chain.\\n\\nTo facilitate seamless functionality for **developers**, it enables **programmable solvers, shared state** and **universal smart contracts** making it the most seamless Developer Experience (DevEX) crypto has ever seen.\\n\\nAnd to ensure a frictionless, zero-learning and hassle-free environment for users, it employs **Cross-chain fee** & **Wallet Abstraction**.\\n\\n**Cross-chain fee abstraction** enables the user, no matter which chain they are on, to fund the gas for their transaction on Push Chain using native token of the chain they are currently on, eliminating the hassle for the user to bridge gas and allowing them to use the app from any chain.\\n\\n**Wallet abstraction** provides a flexible, embeddable wallet experience, tailored to individual user journeys while preserving decentralization. This type of abstraction offers a simpler UX to both existing and new web3 users.\\n\\n- **Existing Web3 Users:** Already using Ethereum, Solana, or another chain? The Push Chain wallet lets you continue using your existing setup -\u2014no extra hoops. Combined with fee abstraction, transactions stay native to the source blockchain, making cross-chain use effortless.\\n- **New Web3 Users (Web2 Normies):** Not web3-savvy? No problem. Just log in with an email or social account. Under the hood, the wallet uses sharding and passkeys to stay non-custodial, but feels as simple and intuitive as web2.\\n\\n\\nBy enabling seamless transactions from any chain, abstracting away gas and wallet complexities, and fostering interoperability across L1s, L2s, and L3s, Push Chain ensures a frictionless web3 experience for users and developers alike.\\n\\nThis results in a terraformed world of universal (fully interoperable) applications for web3. In this paradigm, instead of being a user of \\"Uniswap on Ethereum,\\" \\"Uniswap on Polygon,\\" or \\"Uniswap on Arbitrum,\\" a person simply becomes a **user of Uniswap**.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nInterop is the end goal for ensuring that crypto apps arrive to mainstream users, no matter where they are from, or even if they get onboarded from web2.\\n\\nSeeing interop as a spectrum helps us realize that it\u2019s a problem that we have iteratively solved. Just like how web1 evolved to web2 and then to web3 to fix the problems of its predecessor.\\n\\nSolving this is within our reach and thus the dream of enabling true interoperability from any app of any chain to any user of any chain.\\n\\nLet\u2019s build this future together, let\u2019s build a better, more functional web3\u2026 and let\u2019s build Universal / Fully Interoperable Apps!\\n\\nIt\u2019s about time anyway \ud83d\udcaa"},{"id":"introducing-push-chain-devnet-drop-points-program-s2","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/introducing-push-chain-devnet-drop-points-program-s2","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-20-introducing-devnet-drop-points-program/index.md","title":"Introducing Push Chain Devnet Drop Points Program S2","description":"Introducing Push Chain Devnet Drop Points Program S2","date":"2025-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 20, 2025","tags":[{"label":"Push Chain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-chain"},{"label":"Push Points","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-points"},{"label":"Rewards","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/rewards"},{"label":"Announcements","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/announcements"}],"readingTime":2.6333333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"introducing-push-chain-devnet-drop-points-program-s2","title":"Introducing Push Chain Devnet Drop Points Program S2","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Introducing Push Chain Devnet Drop Points Program S2","text":"Say Hello to Points Program S2 - Earn Points for Exploring Push Chain Devnet\'s Early Ecosystem Apps.

This chain would enable transactions from any chain (ETH, SOL, EVM or non-EVM) to power apps that can be used by **any user \u2014** no matter their chain or wallet. This is the chain of **Universal Apps**. This is Push Chain\\\\!\\n\\n### Built on innovation to eliminate blockchain isolation!\\n\\nPush Chain is revolutionary for both users and developers as it creates an environment for any developer to deploy their universal app in hours via a single universal smart contract deployment.\\n\\nIt also enables users to transact from the comfort, convenience, and choice of their ecosystem, no matter where the app resides.\\n\\nUnder the hood, this is achieved by:\\n\\n- Ability to do **transactions from any chain**\\n- **Fee & Wallet Abstraction** (universal wallet \\\\+ guest wallet)\\n- **Shared State** (read data from other blockchain) \ud83d\udc40\\n- **Generalised Programmable Solve**r (enables acting on the data read from other chains)\\n- **Universal Smart Contract** (enables devs to deploy universal interop apps in hours)\\n- **Shared App Experience** (any user from any chain can access any app of any chain)\\n\\n:::info\\n**Full Stack Interop (Universal Apps)** \\\\= Universal Wallet \\\\+ Generalized Programmable Solvers \\\\+ Shared State \\\\+ Universal Smart Contracts\\n:::\\n\\n### Where does Push Chain fit in?\\n\\nPush chain fits **every project\u2026** **on every chain\\\\!**\\n\\n\\\\- **It allows developers** from any chain to create seamless full interop apps that can be used from any chain, via any wallet.<br />\\n\\\\- **It allows users** the freedom to interact with the wallet of their choice or have a seamless signless experience via Push Universal Wallet with social login.<br />\\n\\\\- **It allows shared app experiences** where users of all chains can come together and engage with Omni DeFi, Omni gaming, Omni NFT, Omni Governance, etc.<br />\\n\\n### What can be built on Push Chain?\\n\\nPush Chain brings seamless interoperability and unifies all L1s, L2s, & L3s and therefore is poised to become the playground of innovation and interop. You can build existing web3 use cases such as:\\n\\n![Primary use cases of Push Chain](./usecasesmain.webp)\\n\\nOr you can better web3 and create innovations:\\n\\n![Consumer use cases of Push Chain](./consumerusecases.webp)\\n\\nOr you can see some popular app examples and to take inspiration from:\\n\\n![Universal app use cases of Push Chain](./appusecases.webp)\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc4b Push Chain Tokenomics\\n\\n![Push Chain Tokenomics](./vestingpc.webp)\\n\\n### Token Utility and Functionality\\n\\nIn the proposal, the Push Chain token is designed with multiple utilities that support the network\'s operation and growth.\\n\\n1. **Network Security**: The token powers Push Chain\u2019s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism through staking and slashing, ensuring the security and reliability of the network.\\n2. **Transaction Fees**: The token serves as the primary method for network fees for transactions and app usage.\\n3. **Governance**: Token holders gain voting rights to propose and decide on protocol changes, actively contributing to the chain\u2019s future.\\n4. **Fee Abstraction**: Push\u2019s Fee+Solver contract is used to enable users of any chain (whether ETH, SOL), etc to pay for gas via native token. A portion of the fee collected will be swapped and burned for Push Chain native token.\\n5. **Incentives**: The token supports an ecosystem of rewards for validators, users, and community members through fee sharing and a reward system.\\n\\nPush Chain adopts a dynamic supply model, which is used among popular chains (like Ethereum and Solana). Post mainnet, new tokens for the chain would be mined solely for node rewards, relayer rewards, and other participants that are required for ensuring chain security, functionality, and decentralization needs.\\n\\n### Burn and Deflationary Mechanism\\n\\nPush Chain has a couple of burn mechanisms owing to it being a Universal Blockchain.\\n\\n1. **Native Chain Burn**: A part of the fees is always burned when native transactions are done on Push Chain.\\n2. **Cross Chain Burn**: Using Fee Abstractions, a part of the fee collected on other blockchain\u2019s native token (ETH, SOL) is swapped for Push Chain native token and burned.\\n\\nThis ensures a deflationary blockchain design that burns tokens as the network and the transactions that happen on it grow. This allows the chain to achieve deflationary tokenomics design while still awarding the validators and other actors. This design enables the creation of an incentivized, sustainable long-term future for Push Chain and all its participants.\\n\\n### Migration Details\\n\\nPush Chain is the result of years of learning from building the leading notification and communication protocol of web3, which was one of the first consumer apps for crypto.\\n\\nOwing to this, apart from the airdrop allocated (see details below) to Push Chain users, creators, developers and ecosystem partners, **there is also a migration drop reserved for the $PUSH holders** (which was the native token of Push Protocol).\\n\\n**For existing $PUSH token holders**, the Push Chain tokenomics proposal allocates 15% of the total Push Chain token supply specifically for migration. The migration will occur at a ratio of **1:15**\u2014meaning for each Push Protocol ($PUSH) token you hold, you\'ll receive 15 Push Chain tokens. For example, if you currently hold 40 $PUSH tokens, you\'ll receive 600 Push Chain tokens after migration.\\n\\nThe launch of Push Chain is designed to reward and incentivize prior Push Protocol ($PUSH) holders for their loyalty and contribution. The migration process for existing $PUSH token holders will work as follows:\\n\\n- Tokens will migrate at a 1:15 ratio (1 Push Protocol token \\\\= 15 Push Chain tokens).\\n- Participants in the Push Chain migration will see 50% of their migrated tokens unlocked immediately, and an additional 50% unlocked after 3 months.\\n- Token migrators will also benefit from a dedicated yield farming pool reserved for them. These rewards will be distributed to token migrators if they stake their migrated Push Chain tokens, to reward them for long-term contribution to the ecosystem.\\n- For example, if you have 100 Push Protocol $PUSH tokens, you\u2019ll receive 750 Push Chain tokens when you migrate and 750 Push Chain tokens after 3 months \u2014 for a total of 1,500 Push Chain tokens. You can choose to stake these tokens to get additional rewards from the Push Chain yield farming pool, distributed periodically.\\n\\nThe Push Chain token migration will be open for 12 months after launch, after which any remaining tokens will go to the community and ecosystem reserve.\\n\\n### Airdrop Details\\n\\nAdditionally, the tokenomics proposal allocates 10% of the total Push Chain token supply for airdrops to past and present Push Protocol application users (notifications, messaging, chat). Along with new users, creators, developers, and ecosystem partners of Push Chain.\\n\\n## Token Distribution Details\\n\\nThe total supply of Push Chain tokens is proposed at **10 billion**, distributed as follows:\\n\\n![Push Chain Tokenomics](./vestingpc.webp)\\n\\n![Push Chain Tokenomics Vesting Details](./vestingdetailspc.webp)\\n\\n1. Push Protocol $PUSH migrators have 50% of migrated tokens unlocked at TGE, followed by the remaining 50% after 3 months.\\n2. Airdrop distributions begin at TGE, but will happen over the course of multiple seasons.\\n3. Core Contributors have a 12-month delay, followed by 24-month vesting.\\n4. Push Labs Treasury has a 36-month vesting.\\n5. Investors have 24-month linear vesting.\\n6. Community and Ecosystem Reserves has a 13.5% unlock at TGE, followed by 36-month vesting."},{"id":"push-chain-joins-forces-with-gaia","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-chain-joins-forces-with-gaia","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-06-gaia-joins-forces-with-push-chain/index.md","title":"Push Chain Joins Forces With Gaia Network","description":"Push Chain Joins Forces With Scroll","date":"2025-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 6, 2025","tags":[{"label":"Push Chain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-chain"},{"label":"Partnerships","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/partnerships"}],"readingTime":1.86,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-chain-joins-forces-with-gaia","title":"Push Chain Joins Forces With Gaia Network","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Push Chain Joins Forces With Scroll","text":"Gaia is coming to Push Chain!

And at normie gatherings I\'m asked which crypto is best for starters. Until now I used to think of these as two distinct questions coming from two distinct audiences, i.e. technical and non-technical. My responses were conditioned by this assumption. At the former I used to talk about our \'[shared state](https://push.org/blog/innovations-by-push-chain/)\' approach and how it is distinguishable from interoperability (more on that below and in subsequent articles). And to the normies I used to suggest that starting-points can be subjective because different projects are trying to do different things. Some for instance are building reliable forms of decentralised cash, while others are trying to democratise the financial system. Still others are trying to get social media out of the hands of big tech, and a lot of them are just having fun.\\n\\nThe problem with my approach was that it left out the real audience: the \'web3 curious\'. This is a huge category which cannot be ignored, and I\'m going to define it rather broadly as those people who have heard of crypto and played around with it a bit [without digging deeper](https://push.org/blog/why-push-chain/). You could say the real reason why they got into the whole thing was quick money. But in order for that to happen I feel they must _at some level believe_ in the larger crypto project. To put it differently, _even if_ they thought they were playing around with \'magic internet money\', some part of them must have known that the magic was real (or had the potential of _becoming_ real). That\'s the part of the collective psyche we need to reach.\\n\\n### Ecosystem Abstraction\\n\\nTo return to the earlier point, I now feel that both audiences were asking me the same thing in different ways, i.e. _which ecosystem?_ It\'s often said that a few years in crypto equals decades in the real world. To me this was never a throwaway sentiment but a profound ground-truth about our industry. When crypto was just starting out people used to debate whether it had \'inherent value\' and whether it could ever become \'money\'. Those questions have more or less disappeared today because most people have concluded that it does. Thanks to the SEC, the critical regulatory question today seems to be whether a particular crypto is a [security](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/08/14/how-the-secs-charge-that-cryptos-are-securities-could-face-an-uphill-battle/) or not. But of course it took humanity more than a thousand years to get from money to finance.\\n\\nThe lesson we can draw from this is that the forms of \'[crypto tribalism](https://medium.com/@adamnite/a-history-of-crypto-tribalism-11f9f9c5cbaf)\' we see today are comparable to [historical tribes](https://www.wideopenspaces.com/native-american-totem-animals-origins-totem-poles-meaning/) who hitched their identity to particular totems and money-objects. We took a giant leap when we adopted the human-first-tribe-later perspective. This allowed us to _abstract away particular ecosystems_ and develop a more global outlook. Of course I am not suggesting that our particular cultural attributes disappeared with modernity, but rather that they were preserved within a more [\'universal\' wrapper](https://www.notion.so/Is-Push-Chain-another-L1-188188aea7f4801a8e5dc22d0c20e0f3?pvs=21).\\n\\n### Cities & Bridges\\n\\nSimply put, \u2018ecosystem abstraction\u2019 is my general response to both questions posed above. I see it as [an ongoing process](https://thenetworkstate.com/) that Push aims to accelerate -- comparable perhaps to globalisation which aims to overcome national boundaries -- rather than as a quantifiable end state. What this means in concrete terms is that we are building a non-competitive L1 that does not distinguish between normies and crypto-natives.\\n\\nWhy, you wonder? Because it\u2019s the [final ecosystem barrier](https://push.org/blog/what-is-consumer-crypto-and-why-does-it-matter/) standing between us and mass adoption. Moreover, it allows us to approach technical problems with a fresh perspective. Consider interoperability. By and large it means two things in crypto: unifying different chains via bridges and developing common standards. The first is a necessary, but more importantly, _organic_ approach because bridges between two parts of a city aren\'t built unless there is significant traffic between them. The trouble right now is that the two sides are run by different municipal authorities, and every time you have to cross between them you must take fresh authorisation from an agent who operates a toll booth.\\n\\nNow if this were a real city the citizens would petition the Mayor and get things changed. They would most likely ask for a monthly ticket and some sort of [\u2018fast tag\u2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTag) on their cars which could automatically calculate and deduct the toll-fees from their wallets. But crypto is decentralised and there is no Mayor to petition. So for us the only solution is to get both municipal authorities to agree on a system for quick and trustworthy communication. Moreover, if both sides have different ticketing systems then they would need to develop a common ticketing standard which is mutually recognised.\\n\\n### Necessity-led invention\\n\\nIn crypto, the reason why interoperability is an especially difficult problem to crack is because it requires unbroken coordination and synchronicity between different ecosystems. With every new chain that is added to the mix, the patchwork expands and becomes more unwieldy. It is therefore legitimate for people to wonder whether we are \u2018another L1\u2019 which is ultimately going to increase this messiness.\\n\\nThe short answer is no: Push is not building its own separate municipality in its own corner of the city. Instead we are building systems (such as [solver networks and fees quotas](https://whitepaper.push.org/)) through which bridge-operators can communicate and coordinate. Imagine if a [tourist](https://www.notion.so/189188aea7f480faaba5f80052406759?pvs=21) was visiting the city and wanted to pass through three different bridges in a single drive. The bridge-operators would need to reach consensus on various things including: (a) does he have enough money for all the tolls? (2) is he a legitimate (non-malicious) actor, and (c) has he received necessary permissions from the respective Mayors of the source and destination cities, etc.\\n\\nIn the context of crypto these steps are reducible to verifiable cross-chain communications, and because Push has been working on this problem from its origin, it is uniquely positioned to create such a system. In other words, the move towards Push Chain was driven by the realisation that we had to do our bit to move the needle on interoperability, not in order to create our own fragmented ecosystem.\\n\\nPersonally, what is most exciting for me is thinking about the new use-cases that such a cross-chain-communication-grid unlocks. Imagine if an _Aurory_ or _Star Atlas_ player is able to leverage Uniswap or Polymarket through in-game intent solvers, or if an artist is able to launch NFTs of their work simultanously across Opensea, Magic Eden and Jpg.store. Here\'s how my friend and colleague Zee put it in a recent conversation: \\"we\'re trying to build systems where people can use their favourite apps on their favourite chains without friction or second thought.\\"\\n\\nYes it\'s an ambitious road, but we\'re determined.\\n\\nLFPush!"},{"id":"push-chain-joins-forces-with-fuse","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-chain-joins-forces-with-fuse","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-05-fuse-joins-forces-with-push-chain/index.md","title":"Push Chain Joins Forces With Fuse","description":"Push Chain Joins Forces With Fuse","date":"2025-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 5, 2025","tags":[{"label":"Push Chain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-chain"},{"label":"Partnerships","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/partnerships"}],"readingTime":2.3366666666666664,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-chain-joins-forces-with-fuse","title":"Push Chain Joins Forces With Fuse","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Push Chain Joins Forces With Fuse","text":"Push Chain is joining forces with the Fuse Network to transform the way enterprises and users transact and operate in the web3 economy.

Blockchain agnostic wallet addresses\\n\\nFor Apps to support users from any chain and achieve **universal compatibility** - there must be a way to identify, interpret and transact with addresses incoming from various chains.\\n\\nAs a shared-state blockchain, Push Chain is designed to parse and handle blockchain addresses alongside the specific chains they originate from.\\n\\nFor instance, Push Chain can identify and support Solana, EVM, Cosmos and any other chain\u2019s addresses.\\nTo achieve this, Push Chain fully adopts [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) blockchain-agnostic wallet addresses, enabling it to deduce the chain, network, and address associated with each transaction ensuring universal compatibility across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\\n\\n### 2. Support Txns from any chain\\n\\nIn addition to parsing addresses across various chains, Push Chain supports transactions from any wallet, regardless of the originating chain\u2014be it Ethereum, Solana, or any other network.\\n\\nPush Chain achieves this by accepting signed payload data and supporting the native signers of individual chains. Validator nodes then verify these signatures \u2192 conduct pre-transaction checks (such as fee validation) \u2192 and then admit the transactions to the network.\\n\\n\x3c!-- Here\u2019s a quick demo of an app that lets you send transactions to Push Chain from any chain of your choice.\\n\\n\\n<video width=\\"640\\" height=\\"360\\" controls>\\n  <source src=\\"./simulate_push_chain.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n\\n</video> --\x3e\\n\\nTo clarify, a user doesn\u2019t have to \u201cbridge\u201d to another chain to use our platform. Instead, the app becomes universal and available to all users of any chain.\\n\\nPush Chain also introduces a new mechanism called **Push ID** to create a consistent and unified interface for users, no matter which wallet they use.\\n\\n**_More on Push ID below..._**\\n\\n### 3. Fee Abstraction\\n\\nWith web3\u2019s progression towards true interoperability, the necessity to hold native tokens for basic interactions creates unnecessary barriers in what should be a borderless ecosystem.\\n\\n**Push Chain\u2019s Fee Abstraction eliminates these digital borders, ensuring universal accessibility and removing the economic friction of owning native tokens for network fees.**\\n\\n- **Onchain Swappers**: Fee contracts on every chain convert native tokens to cover fees automatically\u2014no explicit swaps for Push Chain\u2019s tokens are required.\\n\\n- **Bulk Fee Payments**: Lock and release fees in bulk, then send them to Push Chain directly in the transaction. This removes the bottleneck of waiting on a specific blockchain\u2019s speed.\\n\\n- **Delegated Fees**: Wallets or web3 apps can cover fees, enabling a web2-like UX where the \u201cwebsite\u201d pays for the user.\\n\\nThese mechanisms bridge web2 paradigms into web3 enabling web2 UX in a web3 world -\\n\\n- **Pay-for-content models**: Apps like Facebook and Instagram cover user interaction fees.\\n\\n- **Freemium models**: Apps absorb user costs temporarily, enabling users to later pay in bulk for services after experiencing them for free (e.g., Spotify, Google Drive).\\n\\nPush Chain makes these models possible, creating a frictionless experience and paving the way for building universal apps with borderless shared experiences.\\n\\n### 4. Wallet abstraction\\n\\nAt a higher level, there are two user personas in web3:\\n\\n- **Degens (aka existing web3 users)** - Well accustomed to the fragmented UX, have app & chain specific preferences for every on-chain activity.\\n\\n- **Normies (aka new web3 users)** - New or casual users unfamiliar with web3 complexities - Struggle with the manual and often complicated process of setting up a wallet.\\n\\nWith the rapid proliferation of L1s, L2s and L3s, the UX gap between Degens and Normies is widening, creating a disproportionate balance in user experiences.\\n\\n**Push Chain\u2019s Wallet Abstraction diminishes this divide by creating a balanced ground for every web3 user persona.**\\n\\nWallet abstraction provides a flexible, **embeddable wallet experience**, tailored to individual user journeys enabling any wallet from any chain to connect, interact and transact with Push Chain.\\n\\n**Existing Web3 Users?**\\n\\nAlready using Ethereum, Solana, or another chain? Push Wallet lets you continue using your existing setup\u2014no extra hoops. Combined with fee abstraction, transactions stay native to the source blockchain, making cross-chain use effortless.\\n\\n**New Web3 Users (Web2 Normies)?**\\n\\nNot web3-savvy? No problem. Just log in with an email or social account. Under the hood, the wallet uses sharding and pass keys to stay non-custodial but feels as simple and intuitive as web2.\\n\\n**For users logging in via email or social platforms**, Push Chain ensures security and non-custodial functionality through key sharding. The user\u2019s credentials are divided into three encrypted shards stored across the Push Backend (trusted), local storage (encrypted via a passkey), and Push Chain (also encrypted via a passkey). This approach allows key reconstruction only when accessed by the user, providing a secure yet user-friendly experience that bridges the gap between web2 familiarity and web3 security.\\n\\n### 5. Consumer (Unordered) and Traditional (Ordered) Transactions\\n\\nPresent web3 infra is heavily skewed towards financial apps that require strict ordering of transactions and precise state accuracy.\\nHowever consumer apps, on the other hand, are inclined towards more flexible, faster and parallel transaction needs.\\nConsumer apps are made of two primary elements where:\\n\\n1. _Order is necessary (user payments, financial instruments) and_\\n2. _Order is not critical (messages, comments or likes on a post, retweet, chat, email, gameplay, etc.)._\\n\\nTraditional chains don\u2019t provide the right experience for such use cases forcing consumer apps to make suboptimal compromises impacting their performance and usability.\\n\\n**_Could there be a way of supporting consumer actions in an unordered, parallel and yet decentralised manner?_**\\n\\nAbsolutely yes! This is where **Push Chain innovates a new transaction type - Consumer Transaction**- which instantly unlocks non-financial, mixed-financial apps for web3 helping consumer apps reach faster PMF.\\n\\nManaging hyper-scalable apps with thousands of parallel transactions on-chain - is not easy.\\nPush Chain makes it possible using its new innovation - **True Scale**.\\n\\nWith True Scale, Push Chain\'s network capacity and its read-write throughput grow organically, as more nodes join its consensus.\\nThis enables parallel execution of thousands of consumer transactions, near-instant finality and quicker information storage and retrieval.\\n\\nHere\u2019s how the Push Chain achieves true scale.\\n\\n### 6. True Scale: Sub second finality (speed)\\n\\nPush Chain splits the nodes into three types - **Validator, Storage and Archival** and enables a node governance smart contract that keeps track of all the nodes that are present in the network.\\n\\n- **Validator Nodes** - Responsible for validating transactions.\\n\\n- **Storage Nodes** - Dynamically shard data based on the hash of blockchain-agnostic addresses and store it.\\n\\n- **Archival Nodes** - Maintain a full snapshot of all transactions on the network.\\n\\nThese role-specific nodes enable parallel validation to be done on any type of consumer transaction ensuring near-instant finality.\\n\\n**Note:** All txs (write or read) are attested by random validators/storage nodes ensuring that malicious nodes result in slashing.\\n\\n**Node Registry Smart Contract:** Push Chain employs a registry smart contract to register these nodes, manage dynamic sharding, set replication factors, and enable parallel validators that scale dynamically with the number of nodes in the network. This approach ensures linear scaling, allowing the network to handle increased read and write demands efficiently as it grows.\\n\\nBecause of these different nodes and smart contract setting up parallel validators, the tx sent to the network can land on any of the _\u2018n\u2019_ number of parallel validators which are then instantly moved to processing (250ms block), this is what enables sub-second finality for Push Chain.\\n\\n### 7. True Scale: Parallel validators (scaling write throughput)\\n\\nPush Chain achieves true scaling of write transactions, particularly for consumer transactions, where the consumer txs are packed in unordered blocks (or should we call them **stateless blocks**!? ).\\n\\nAllowing these transactions to be processed through any active validator node promises near-instant finality, and the write throughput (or TPS) of the chain increases linearly as the number of nodes in the network grows.\\n\\n### 8. True Scale: Dynamic Sharding (scaling read throughput)\\n\\n**Push Chain achieves true scaling of reading transactions by implementing dynamic sharding on storage nodes.**\\n\\nData chunks within each shard are mapped to blockchain-agnostic addresses and are dynamically redistributed as new storage nodes are added to the network.\\n\\nIn addition, the chain introduces a node governing smart contract onto which each node (regardless of the type) is registered before getting admitted to the network. Since this node-registry smart contract knows the number of nodes in the network, it is able to dynamically shard and assign data chunks and replication factors ensuring the network is fast and becomes faster in retrieving data as new nodes are added.\\n\\n### 9. Push ID\\n\\nIn a universal chain like Push Chain - One essential element for bringing shared app experiences to users is the ability to track users\u2019 on-chain identity - and not just their wallets.\\n\\nOne user may have multiple wallets, spanning various chains and ecosystems whether EVM or nonEVM.\\nThis led us to create the unified Push ID, giving each user one identity that spans all their wallets, both EVM and non-EVM. Instead of tying interactions strictly to a single wallet, transactions are now accredited to a user\u2019s Push ID.\\n\\nThe Push ID mapping allows for reverse lookups guaranteeing a consistent and unified interface for users, no matter which wallet they use. developers can fetch, index, and understand a user\u2019s full spectrum of interactions across chains, all mapped to one identity.\\n\\n### 10. Shared State and Universal Smart Contracts\\n\\n\x3c!-- shared state diagram --\x3e\\n\\n![shared state diagram](./image2.webp)\\n\\n**Shared State**\\n\\nWith Push ID and Any Chain Tx, we realized that accessing a wallet\u2019s state across different blockchains is a game changer.\\n\\nOne thing that\u2019s missing over here though was the ability to get the individual state of all the wallets which in essence will allow smart contracts to know the entire state of individual wallet(s) that are connected to the user. This feature is what we call a Shared state.\\n\\n**Shared state allows Push Chain to access data from its own chain as well as supported external chains!**\\n\\nWith shared state, you can read wallet activities like NFTs, DeFi positions, governance participation, and so much more!\\n\\n**Universal Smart Contracts**\\n\\nA shared state chain is essential to enable shared app experiences. This chain must have the ability to read the state of wallets across other chains, facilitating universal smart contracts and creating an ecosystem where users from any chain\u2014or even web2\u2014can interact seamlessly. Such a chain would provide shared settlement across both EVM and non-EVM chains, ushering in an era of universal apps and shared experiences.\\n\\nUsing shared state in VM, Push allows developers to write universal smart contracts with which universal app experiences become possible. Users, regardless of their origin\u2014whether from any chain or ecosystem\u2014can effortlessly interact with consumer apps that prioritize user engagement without regard to how or where they enter the system.\\n\\nUltimately, **Universal Smart Contracts and the ability to interact with all chains through Push Chain and represent our ultimate goal: Eliminating Web3 friction and delivering the best shared app experience possible.**\\n\\n## Build Universal Apps!\\n\\nUniversal AI apps, Universal social apps, Unified Prediction markets and many more!\\nWant to know the countless app innovations that you can make happen because of Push Chain?\\nExplore our [Innovations that can be built on Push Chain Blog](https://push.org/blog/consumer-apps-that-can-be-built-on-push-chain/)\\n\\n### Next Steps\u200b\ud83d\udc47\\n\\n- Check out the [Push Chain Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.push.org/?utm_source=pushblog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pcgov) for a detailed overview of the vision and the underlying technicalities.\\n\\n- Visit the [Push Chain Website](https://push.org/chain/?utm_source=pushblog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pcgov) to find a one-pager explanation of the vision.\\n\\n- [Push Chain Devnet](https://scan.push.org/home?utm_source=pushblog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pcgov) is running live on Proof-of-Stake network validators, storage and archival nodes.

We\u2019ve delivered over 140M notifications, built a community of 500K aggregate users, powered notifications for 500+ projects, and are known as the de facto leader in notifications and communications for web3.\\nWe took the biggest and the most ambitious step in its history last week and have launched governance for its evolution to Push Chain, a shared state blockchain for building universal applications. It is a sharded Proof of Stake (PoS) chain built to allow developers to create user-centric app experiences and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, L3s.\\n\\nThe journey often matters more than the destination, and we couldn\u2019t agree more. From our beginnings at ETHGlobal 2020, to becoming an EF alumnus, ranking as a top 5 project in Gitcoin Grants, securing funding from leading VCs and angels, inventing the communication stack for web3, and now launching a consumer-centric L1 to unify web3 - each milestone has shaped our path and brought us here.

The thesis was that protocols in web3 only interact with wallet addresses and thus it made sense to build a notification and communication system that can inform these wallets.\\n\\nSo the next time your DeFi loan is about to be liquidated, or a governance proposal comes up or your ENS is about to expire or someone comments on your web3 social, you get notified and can re-engage.\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 1 --\x3e\\n\\n![First Image of Evolution of Push](./image10.webp)\\n\\n### Creating MVP at ETHGlobal HackMoney 2020\\n\\nWe were guided by EF to go and build the project out first at ETHGlobal, which is what we did and was the best thing that ever happened for us. We have made friends that are mentors, friends that are our investors, friends that helped us connect to relevant projects and friends that geeked out together on tech.\\n\\nExcuse the video quality, I still hadn\u2019t learned at this point what good quality cams or lighting could do.\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\",aspectRatio: \'56.25%\' }} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vvEpB3ddTko\\" title=\\"#HackMoney Group 1 Judging\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\n### Getting help, support and mentorship from EF\\n\\nWe have always said that Ethereum is where innovation has fostered traditionally and that is due to the community and the folks at Ethereum that go way beyond to help you in your journey.\\n\\nEF has helped us, like countless other projects in guiding through the tranches of web3, especially when you are just getting started.\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 2 --\x3e\\n\\n![Second Image of Evolution of Push](./image3.webp)\\n<ImageText>https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/08/19/esp-beyond-grants</ImageText>\\n\\n### Making it to Top 3 of Gitcoin Grants (Round 7)\\n\\nOne of the best feelings we had was when we participated in Gitcoin Grants and the community came together to fund us out. This was in many ways the first check that we saw after we had started building Push (then EPNS).\\n\\nThere\u2019s serenity in making something that gets loved by the people for whom you are building and is the best feeling that any entrepreneur can have. To us, these 214 contributors is what made everything we had done so far worthwhile!\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 3 --\x3e\\n\\n![Third Image of Evolution of Push](./image8.webp)\\n\\nOf course, the cherry on top was when Vitalik covered GR 7 in his [blog](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2020/10/18/round7.html), and we among all the other top projects got a place in his blog, if not in his heart \ud83d\ude05.\\n\\n### Getting into Kernel Genesis Batch\\n\\nMaking it into Kernel was a dream come true. I still remember the joy I felt when we were selected. In our application form, there was a question: <b>What makes you special from any other project?</b> And what we wrote was <b>Every project that we have seen is special in its own ways, so nothing makes us special with respective to them but here\u2019s why we feel we should be selected:</b> Technical and gap in communication, ux, etc\\n\\nWe submitted this but then stressed out on if we were rude or missed the context of the question. Thankfully, Vivek, Sachin and team embraced our web3 vibe wholeheartedly.\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 4 --\x3e\\n\\n![Fourth Image of Evolution of Push](./image11.webp)\\n<ImageText>https://x.com/harshrajat/status/1279398824729952257</ImageText>\\n\\nThis was also the place where we made so many friends that I still reach out to for help now. This was the place where I first dmed Juan Benet, Met Sandeep, Alok (Standard VC), Thomas Klocanas and countless other folks that I look up to.\\n\\nThis in a way completed our journey of getting onboarded to web3 as we were now part of the vibes!\\n\\n### Making awesome friends along the way!\\n\\nDuring this entire journey, we made friends who just wanted to help and the only thing we had to do was ask, or tweet, or dm. This was and still is why Ethereum is always home for us!\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 5 --\x3e\\n\x3c!-- image 6 --\x3e\\n\x3c!-- image 7 --\x3e\\n\\n![Fifth Image of Evolution of Push](./image5.webp)\\n<ImageText>https://x.com/owocki/status/1335637426392330241</ImageText>\\n\\n![Sixth Image of Evolution of Push](./image4.webp)\\n<ImageText>https://x.com/jason_chen998/status/1695082395505172944</ImageText>\\n\\n![Seventh Image of Evolution of Push](./image7.webp)\\n<ImageText>https://x.com/defiprime/status/1346124418192465928</ImageText>\\n\\nPush Protocol is the \u201cMissing piece of Web3\u201d that is required to bring the UX of Web2 to Web3.\\n\\n## The start of web3 notifications\\n\\n### Piloting with OG protocols\\n\\nThe next phase of our journey was to start sending web3 notifications and we had a chicken and egg problem over here. Notifications are useful for wallets to show if popular protocols are sending them but for popular protocols to embrace web3 notifs, wallets need to integrate them \ud83d\ude31.\\n\\nWe took a chance and reached out to some of the best and top protocols in the space back then, hint: they still are the leaders! They were the ones who helped us crack this chicken and egg problem and solidified our conviction on why web3 is the future - it\u2019s because each one of them is trying to expand the boundaries of web3.\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 8 --\x3e\\n\\n![Eigth Image of Evolution of Push](./image9.webp)\\n<ImageText>https://x.com/Uniswap/status/1377374973090689030</ImageText>\\n\\n### Getting backed by people we adore\\n\\nThe momentum generated by Push till this point helped us get the attention of the best angels and VCs in the space. The success that we got due to the community, builders, web3 OGs coming and helping us together led us to secure our seed (and later series A) with folks that had some of the best mind share and vision for web3.\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 9 --\x3e\\n\\n![Ninth Image of Evolution of Push](./image12.webp)\\n\\n\u2665\ufe0fand shoutout to backers of Push Protocol including BalajiS, Sandeep Nailwal, Scott Moore, A.Capital, ParaFi, Binance Labs, Jump, Sino Global and so many more!\\n\\n### Getting noticed and spreading the word\\n\\nPush started getting noticed by OGs of web3, we were so humbled by people who we view as mentors and thought leaders writing about us. Push has reached the point where it had a chance to terraform web3, one notif at a time\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 10 --\x3e\\n\\n![Tenth Image of Evolution of Push](./image1.webp)\\n<ImageText>[Why India Should Buy Bitcoin Article by BalajiS](https://balajis.com/p/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin) | [Excited to fund EPNS Tweet](https://x.com/balajis/status/1336367129960931329) | [Unstoppable Domains Launches Gated Groups Article](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/unstoppable-domains-launches-token-gated-group-chats) | [EPNS Raises 10M at 131M Valuation Article](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/14/ethereum-push-notification-service-raises-10m-at-131m-valuation)</ImageText>\\n\\n## Building one of the first consumer app\\n\\nWe now realize that apart from inventing the communication protocol for web3, we also were building one of the first consumer app for it which was non-financial in nature and was driven by the utility it offered to average user than the 10x other financial apps promised (and thus, user was incentivized to learn web3 broken ux).\\n\\nThis realization helped us in paving forward an app that is useful and frictionless for the web3 user and enabled us to identify the features that we wanted as we moved towards decentralizing our notification nodes.\\n\\n### Building for scalability and speed\\n\\nWe realized very quickly that notification unlike traditional transactions needs to be scalable. It needed an infra that can scale up and maintain speed. To enable this, we built out a solution involving dynamic sharding, ensuring that the solution scales up as more notifications and wallets join in.\\n\\n### Inventing consumer tx by accident!\\n\\nWhile building our notification nodes for write throughput, ie: handling tens of thousands of parallel notifications. We came up with the architecture of having parallel validators, since having order in notifications was not required.\\n\\nThis paved the way for parallel validators where notifications can be sent to any validators which will then form stateless blocks (or unordered blocks). We didn\u2019t know back then but we had unlocked a massive innovation in web3, having txs where ordering is not critical. This later formed the backbone of Push Chain\u2019s speed and linear scalability.\\n\\n### Building for seamless web3 UX\\n\\nAnother thing that we wanted our notification protocol to have was a seamless onboarding process where the user can just sign in once and then, just like web2, they are not required to sign things again and again. Our Chat Protocol and PGP implementation helped us realize and solve for the most seamless web3 UX. Later on, this learning was transformed into wallet and fee abstraction for Push Chain.\\n\\n### Building for unification of web3\\n\\nAnd finally, we wanted this to be the communication protocol of web3, where notifications and chat can come to Push as a universal hub. Where, protocols from Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Aptos, or any other EVM or non-EVM are able to come together in a seamless interoperable way.\\n\\nThis is not bridging, as bridging moves funds or assets from one chain to another. But, instead it\u2019s unification or having a universal hub. A place where users from all chains come together. This feature is what was transformed to Push Chain as being the universal hub for all chains, where transactions from any chain are supported, where shared state of all wallets are available, where all L1s, L2s and L3s can come together and use Push as a shared settlement layer.\\n\\n### Rebranding to become the communication protocol of web3\\n\\nWe started building notifications for web3 under the brand of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) which made sense when we started since Apple also names their notification service as Apple Push Notification Service (APNS).\\n\\nBut as we dived deep and started building the features for enabling notifications, chat. We quickly became aware that a non-Ethereum developer might be confused by the name EPNS. Thus, we decided to rebrand to Push, we picked this name because:\\n\\n- We were now placed to become the communication protocol of web3, so <b>Ethereum</b> had to go from <b>Ethereum Push Notification Service</b>.\\n- We were not doing just notification, but instead had chat among other communication tools so <b>Notification</b> had to go from <b>Push Notification Service.</b>\\n- And lastly, we were not a service but a decentralized protocol of web3, so <b>Service</b> had to go from <b>Push Service</b>.\\n- Leading us to rebrand to <b>Push</b>.\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 11 --\x3e\\n\\n![Eleventh Image of Evolution of Push](./image6.webp)\\n<ImageText>https://x.com/PushChain/status/1574771582790406144</ImageText>\\n\\n### Becoming the leading notification protocol for web3\\n\\nPush notifications protocol came a long way from its humble beginnings to now. Today, we have powered hundreds of millions of notifications sent to web3 users across the globe.\\n\\nWe have been integrated natively in many wallets and protocols including Unstoppable, Shapeshift, Decentraland, Metamask Snap and so many more and have been powering notifications and communication for awesome protocols such as Cowswap, 1inch, dydx, hyperliquid, lens, polygon and various others.\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 12 --\x3e\\n\\n![Twelfth Image of Evolution of Push](./image2.webp)\\n<ImageText>https://x.com/hypurr_co/status/1851645401834959098?s=46&t=iq2iJvugwsC0iZ3dI-wFOw</ImageText>\\n\\n## Enters Push Chain - realization of what we actually built and its impact on web3\\n\\n### Realization of the end game\\n\\nDuring building for our vision of the most perfect consumer app and the decentralized notification protocol and nodes out. We eventually realized that what we have built instead is far more significant and solves for the seamless web3 that we all dream of.\\n\\nThis realization is what turned into our shared state blockchain - Push Chain, which while being an L1, is not just another L1 as it\u2019s built to be used by users of any other chain without them needing to switch or bridge to this chain. It\u2019s the future of web3 built for unification, consumer and universal apps and seamless onboarding.\\n\\n### Launching Push Chain proposal and Devnet \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nThis has led us to launching our proposal of Push Chain, which just to recap is a shared state L1 blockchain for shared app experiences. Push Chain enables txs from any chain (Solana, Eth, EVM, or non-EVM) with fast finality of \\\\<1 second and can scale infinitely as nodes increase, supporting tens of thousands of parallel transactions.\\n\\n- Push Chain introduces groundbreaking features including:\\n- Ability to do any chain tx\\n- Introduces a new tx type - Consumer transaction (order not important)\\n- Provides wallet and fee abstraction for a seamless user experience\\n- Enables true scale with parallel validators and dynamic sharding\\n- Able to do \\\\<1 second finality\\n- Utilizes universal smart contracts - capable of accessing the state of a wallet belonging to a different chain\\n\\n\x3c!-- image 13 --\x3e\\n\\n![Thirtheenth Image of Evolution of Push](./image14.webp)\\n<ImageText>https://x.com/PushChain/status/1867184458631405607</ImageText>\\n\\nThe evolution and the journey has been thrilling and we would love to have you, our biggest asset, the community with us as we launch Push Chain and invite developers to build universal apps!\\n\\nAs is the norm in web3, let\u2019s end the article with saying in its truest sense for the future of Push - We all are just getting started!!!"},{"id":"consumer-apps-that-can-be-built-on-push-chain","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/consumer-apps-that-can-be-built-on-push-chain","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-09-consumer-apps-that-can-be-built-on-push-chain/index.md","title":"Consumer Apps \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd Push Chain - Innovations that can be built on Push Chain","description":"Consumer Apps \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd Push Chain - Innovations that can be built on Push Chain","date":"2024-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 9, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Chain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-chain"},{"label":"Consumer Apps","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/consumer-apps"},{"label":"Universal Apps","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/universal-apps"},{"label":"Shared App Experience","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/shared-app-experience"}],"readingTime":5.276666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"consumer-apps-that-can-be-built-on-push-chain","title":"Consumer Apps \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd Push Chain - Innovations that can be built on Push Chain","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Consumer Apps \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd Push Chain - Innovations that can be built on Push Chain","text":"Web 3 is growing at lightning speed!

Crowdsourced from Push Fam \ud83e\udef6 and curated by the Push team \ud83d\udcaa.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What is Push Chain?\\n\\nPush Chain is a shared-state L1 blockchain designed for universal (interoperable) applications.\\n\\nBy enabling seamless **transactions from any chain** (Eth, Solana, EVM, or non-EVM), **abstracting away gas** and **wallet** complexities, and **fostering interoperability** across L1s, L2s, and L3s, Push Chain ensures a frictionless web3 experience for users and developers alike.\\n\\nPush Chain enables **full stack interop** enabling apps from any chain to be accessed by the users of any chain (polymarket from any chain, pump.fun from any chain, etc). The result is a layer 1 that unites all L1s \ud83e\udd1d L2s \ud83e\udd1d L3.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How does Push Chain work?\\n\\n![Push Chain Architecture](./pcoverview.webp \'Push Chain Architecture\')\\n\\nPush Chain is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) L1 blockchain that is designed to eliminate fragmentation across all chains.\\n\\nIt leverages on several innovations such as specialized validators, off-chain relayers and generalized solvers working in tandem to ensure a user or developer is able to read and write on any chain. This eliminates the silos of different chains, wallet conventions, liquidity fragmentation and more.\\n\\nIt introduces some groundbreaking innovations such as:\\n\\n**Fee and Wallet abstraction** \\\\- allowing wallets/users of any chain to interact natively while being on the chain of their choice.\\n\\n**Universal Wallet** \\\\- ensuring user can login via social or email and still have non-custodial wallets created for them for all chains (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, etc).\\n\\n**Shared State** \\\\- enabling developers to read the state of any wallet or smart contract of any other blockchain via smart contract on Push Chain.\\n\\n**Programmable Solvers** \\\\- ensures that a developer can create a basic path for cross chain actions (write actions) based on the shared state.\\n\\n**Universal Smart Contracts** \\\\- giving developers ability to use shared state and generalized solvers for read and write action in chain agnostic fashion. And enables users to use fees and wallet abstraction to access any app or any chain without any hassle.\\n\\nPush Chain uses all these innovations to enable reading (shared state) or writing to different chains (programmable solvers), all controlled by the universal smart contract. The fee and wallet abstraction further enables a seamless, user centric approach as the learnings for a user is abstracted away no matter from what chain they chose to interact.\\n\\nThis results in universal applications for web3. In this paradigm, instead of being a user of \\"Uniswap on Ethereum,\\" \\"Uniswap on Polygon,\\" or \\"Uniswap on Arbitrum,\\" a person simply becomes a **user of Uniswap**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Why is Push Chain unique for users?\\n\\nPush Chain addresses specific gaps in the existing blockchains, such as interoperability, state access across chains, programmable solvers and wallet abstraction resulting in a **full stack interop**. While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in their own eco-system and an aggregator to unite these chains are needed.\\n\\nPush Chain\u2019s focus is on being a **shared state chain** for universal (interoperable) applications acting as a unifying layer where all chains can come together and use PC as universal hub or do settlement between them.\\n\\nPC offers a new paradigm of web3 that works from **Any Chain.** For **Any Wallet/User.** And is suitable for **Any App.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What are the core innovations of Push Chain?\\n\\n**Any Chain Txs and Blockchain Agnostic Wallet Addresses**\\n\\nAs a shared-state blockchain, Push Chain adopts **CAIP-10 standards** (shoutout to [@pedrouid](https://x.com/pedrouid \'Follow Pedrouid on X\'), allowing it to parse the chain, network, and address of each transaction. This ensures true interoperability across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\\n\\n**Consumer Txs (unordered) and Traditional Txs (ordered)**\\n\\nPush introduces a new type of transaction that we define as **consumer transactions**.\\n\\nWhen you look at consumer apps of web2, you quickly notice that they are made of two components:\\n\\n1. **Transactions where order is necessary** (e.g., user payments, financial instruments).\\n2. **Transactions where order is not critical** (e.g., messages, comments or likes on a post, retweets, chats, emails, gameplay, etc.).\\n\\nThese unordered actions dominate consumer apps, but traditional chains don\u2019t provide the right experience for them.\\n\\nPush Chain introduces **unordered transactions**, where order is not critical. These transactions can be sent to any of the validators running on the network to be processed.\\n\\nThis innovation will have a significant impact on web3, enabling consumer apps that combine financial, mixed-financial, and non-financial transactions with the same scalability and speed seen in web2.\\n\\n**Parallel Validators & Dynamic Sharding**\\n\\nPush Chain uses a **node governor smart contract**, which registers all the different types of nodes. This governor contract not only registers nodes but also keeps track of the number of validator, storage, and archival nodes.\\n\\n- It adjusts the replication factor.\\n- Assigns address chunks to shards.\\n- Enables parallel validators to process transactions, allowing the chain to scale linearly with the number of nodes added to the network.\\n\\nThis approach achieves **true scale**.\\n\\n**Wallet and Fee Abstraction**\\n\\n**Wallet abstraction** provides a flexible, embeddable wallet experience, tailored to individual user journeys while preserving decentralization. This abstraction simplifies the user experience (UX) for both existing and new web3 users.\\n\\n**For Existing Web3 Users**\\n\\n- If you\'re already using Ethereum, Solana, or another chain, the **Push Chain wallet** allows you to continue using your current setup\u2014no extra hoops.\\n- Combined with **fee abstraction**, transactions stay native to the source blockchain, making cross-chain use effortless.\\n\\n**For New Web3 Users (Web2 Normies)**\\n\\n- Not web3-savvy? No problem. Just log in with an email or social account.\\n- Under the hood, the wallet uses sharding and passkeys to stay non-custodial but feels as simple and intuitive as web2.\\n\\n**Shared State and Universal Smart Contracts**\\n\\nWith **Push ID**, the state of a non-Push wallet and multiple wallets across any chain is mapped to a single user. This ensures that the user\'s state across all blockchains is known.\\n\\nCombining this capability with **universal smart contracts** unlocks innovations that web3 hasn\u2019t seen before, enabling the era of universal apps.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What problems does Push Chain solve?\\n\\n- **Fragmentation:** Unifies app experiences across blockchains, bridging EVM and non-EVM ecosystems.\\n- **Scalability:** Achieves true scaling through dynamic sharding, stateless blocks, and parallel block execution.\\n- **Interoperability:** Supports transactions from any blockchain, enabling shared app states.\\n- **Finality:** Near-instant finality (~1-2 seconds), essential for real-time app experiences.\\n- **User Experience:** Simplifies onboarding and interaction via derived keys and unified user identities (Push ID / DID).\\n- **Universal Apps:** Enables applications to be built that can be accessed by any user from any chain instantly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What are the different phases of Push Chain?\\n\\nPhase 1 lays the groundwork of building universal consumer apps focusing on introducing a scalable, chain agnostic, and unified layer capable of handling any types of consumer apps including financial but also non-financial and mixed-financial apps. The features in this phase include:\\n\\n- Enabling true scale apps\\n- Allowing transactions from any chain\\n- Introducing Consumer transactions (where ordering is not important)\\n- Push VM for complex on-chain applications\\n- Fee abstraction\\n- Wallet abstraction\\n- Push ID to map multiple EVM and non-EVM wallet to a single identity\\n- Enabling PoS (Proof of Stake) with dynamic sharding and parallel validators\\n\\nPhase 2 centers on facilitating seamless interoperability between chains which is a stepping stone in enabling universal smart contracts to usher in universal apps.\\nThis phase introduces a solver network capable of instant cross-chain transactions, both financial and non-financial based. The non-financial distinction is crucial as it enables all payloads to move instantly between Push-connected chains, benefiting consumer applications like:\\n\\n- Social media\\n- Marketplaces\\n- Gaming\\n- Other consumer-facing use cases\\n\\nPhase 3 is about introducing shared state and the launch of universal smart contracts, enabling true shared state and universal apps.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Technical\\n\\n### Why does Push Chain need to be an L1 instead of an L2 chain?\\n\\nPush Chain is purpose-built to be a shared-state blockchain for universal, on-chain apps. To achieve this in practice, Push Chain functions as a settlement layer (L1) for multiple L1s, L2s, and L3s.\\n\\nThis architecture enables it to accept transactions from any chain, reduce cross-chain friction through gas abstraction, and provide wallet abstraction for seamless onboarding\u2014whether users are web3 veterans or newcomers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Is Push Chain EVM Compatible?\\n\\nPush Chain begins as EVM compatible and becomes more and more compatible with further chains as it evolves. Further information can be found in both the Push Chain [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.push.org \'Whitepaper of Push Chain\').\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Will Push Chain be compatible with both EVM and non-EVM chains?\\n\\nYes, Push Chain is designed to support both EVM and non-EVM chains, ensuring maximum interoperability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPush Chain addresses pervasive gaps in the existing blockchains; specifically interoperability, shared app experiences, and scalability. While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in silos and lack the ability to unify state across multiple blockchains. Push Chain\u2019s focus is on being a **shared state chain for universal applications**, offering seamless cross-chain interactions and unparalleled scalability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What does shared state blockchain mean?\\n\\nShared state refers to the present status of onchain data. A shared-state blockchain is one that has read-and-write access to its own state and the state of all other chains it interacts with. A shared state chain is capable of handling data, liquidity, and users from any other chain.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What sets Push Chain apart from other shared state chains?\\n\\n- **True Scalability:** Parallel execution, dynamic sharding, and stateless blocks.\\n- **Interoperability:** Seamless integration with EVM and non-EVM chains.\\n- **User-Centric Design:** Derived keys and Push DID for enhanced user experiences.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How does Push Chain achieve shared state?\\n\\nThe term shared state means that Push Chain not only has read and write access to its own state but also has read-only access to all the other supported chains\u2019 states. This is the final and most imperative phase of Push Chain, and it enables **universal apps** that seamlessly function across multiple chains.\\n\\n![Push Chain Universal App](./pcuniversalapp.webp \'Push Chain - Shared State Chain for Universal Apps\')\\n\\nPush Chain achieves shared state by leveraging Push ID, which maps multiple EVM and non-EVM wallets to a single identity. This allows for a single user to have a single state across all chains, enabling true shared state.\\n\\nThe whole vision of universal apps with shared states is achieved through 4 core features:\\n\\n- **Fee and Wallet Abstraction:**\\n  With wallet abstraction, Push Chain aims to enable seamless user onboarding without going through the manual and complicated procedure of setting up a web3 wallet.\\n  With fee abstraction, the chain eliminates the friction of requiring to hold native gas strictly in the wallet in use.\\n\\n- **Seamless Interoperability:**\\n  With Phase 2 of its roadmap, the chain aims to establish seamless interoperability between chains to enable cross-chain features in the apps.\\n\\n  The interoperability will be enabled using a solver network capable of instant cross-chain transactions to ensure better UX. The network will be designed to move not only value but also arbitrary payloads that seamlessly transfer smart contract calls to other chains.\\n\\n- **Any Chain Transaction:**\\n  With fee abstraction layer and interoperability, the chain is then able to provide the capability for users and apps on this chain to seamlessly initiate transactions for any chain.\\n\\n- **Unified VM:**\\n  A unified VM that enables complex universal smart contract logic that is able to execute cross chain actions.\\n\\nCombining these 4 main pillars, the chain aims to achieve shared app experiences and unlock a plethora of new cross-chain and universal app use cases in every domain of web3.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What does true scale mean?\\n\\nTrue scale is the ability of a protocol\'s ecosystem to grow at both the infrastructure and user experience levels. Push Chain achieves this by enabling universal applications that users can try without worrying about complex infrastructure decisions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Token Related\\n\\n### Will there be a new token associated with Push Chain?\\n\\nAs a new layer 1, Push Chain would have its own native token with tokenomics suited to the functioning, maintenance, and security of a blockchain.\\n\\nThe governance proposal for Push Chain introduces the layer 1 as a potential direction for the Push ecosystem. If approved, Push would then introduce tokenomics for feedback and discussion among the community.\\n\\nPush Chain would need a new token because an L1 token has a fundamentally different design and purpose than a token designed to incentivize the notifications protocol. A priority for Push Chain tokenomics is to ensure that all Push Protocol $PUSH holders are able to migrate their tokens to the Push Chain native token (ticker TBD).\\n\\n**Note: Push Chain mainnet is not live, nor is any token related to Push Chain besides Push Protocol [$PUSH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ \'$PUSH on CMC\').** Any communication about Push Chain will come directly from the Push company website and X / Twitter handle.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Doubts\\n\\n### What Happens to Push Notification and Push Chat?\\n\\nPush Chain is a natural evolution of Push Protocol\'s vision. Current services of Push Protocol remain a priority, ensuring they continue to improve while benefiting from the new infrastructure.\\n\\nToday\'s push notification and chat protocols will benefit significantly from being built on top of Push Chain. A dedicated section of the team will focus on maintaining and enhancing these protocols, ensuring they remain the de-facto standard in their respective domains.\\n\\nBy aligning with Push Chain, notifications and chat sent through the protocols will be processed as transactions on the chain. This integration not only enables these protocols to accrue value but also marks the beginning of a new chapter in their evolution, further enhancing their utility and impact within the web3 ecosystem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Is this project a distraction from improving current services?\\n\\nNo, read \u261d\ufe0f [above](#what-happens-to-push-notification-and-push-chat).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Is Push Chain a shift away from Push Protocol\'s core focus on notifications and chat?\\n\\nNo. Push Chain builds upon Push Protocol\u2019s established foundation. Push Chain represents the **next evolution** of Push Protocol, not a departure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How will the launch of Push Chain affect existing partnerships and integrations?\\n\\nPush Chain complements existing partnerships by offering additional capabilities like cross-chain support, faster finality, and scalable solutions. It strengthens collaborations by enabling partners to build and scale universal applications.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How will Push Chain maintain decentralization while scaling?\\n\\nDynamic sharding and parallel execution enable scalability without compromising decentralization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Are there any risks of centralization with Push Chain?\\n\\n**No.** Push Chain\u2019s architecture emphasizes decentralization:\\n\\n- Validators, storagea and archivals nodes operate independently and are incentivized and penalized through PoS. The network is designed to be robust and resilient. Our whitepaper has more details on the network design and the decentralization mechanisms used to protect and secure the network, see [whitepaper point 7.1 (Handling Malicious Validators) and 7.2 (Handling Malicious Storage Nodes)](https://whitepaper.push.org/ \'Handling Malicious Validators and Storage Nodes in Push Chain\'). Governance and DAO also add a layer of decentralization to the network.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## DAO and Grants\\n\\n### How will the current governance system change when the new token launches and when the migration is completed?\\n\\nThe Push DAO governance system will both evolve and expand as Push Chain launches. This is an expected process, since Push is becoming something more encompassing than the original Push Protocol. Delegates, ambassador programs, subDAOs, and everything else related to the DAO will be upgraded to reflect the key goals of achieving status as the hub for universal applications, run by all of the groups that make them possible.\\n\\n### How do I get involved with Push Chain Grants?\\n\\nWhile we are thrilled with the early interest coming from developers to build universal apps, we are still in the governance phase for ratifying our evolution from Push Protocol to Push Chain and hence do not have a grants program now.\\n\\nThis will change very soon once the community approves of Push Chain! Meanwhile, to frontrun other grantees, please drop us an email at <a href=\\"mailto:team@push.org\\">team@push.org</a> with the subject line as **Grant MEOW** and your app idea. Or, simply follow [@PushChain](https://x.com/PushChain \'Follow Push Chain on X\') for more updates around the grants program and its release.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Developers, Users and Node Operators\\n\\n### Is there a migration plan for current applications and users?\\n\\nThe current Push Protocol application will stay fully functional for all its applications, integrations, and users. Eventually, Push Protocol notifications and chat will migrate to Push Chain as one of the first universal applications live on the new layer 1.\\n\\nAt that time, we will help apps and users using Push Protocol to migrate. However, for the time being, no migration plan is required for current applications and users.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Are there incentives for early adopters or node operators on Push Chain?\\n\\nValidators and relayers will earn staking rewards. Early adopters and existing Push Protocol $PUSH holders will be eligible for a token migration from the original $PUSH to the Push Chain token (ticker TBD).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What benefits does Push Chain offer to developers and users?\\n\\n- **For Developers:**: A unified platform for cross-chain app development, scalability, and easy onboarding. Push Chain lets developers build applications that can be used by any users on any chain.\\n\\n**For Users**: Simplified interactions, seamless onboarding with derived keys, and faster transactions with 1-2s finality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How can developers start building on Push Chain?\\n\\nPush Chain will offer developer tools, an SDK, and comprehensive documentation. Keep tabs on our site and our main social handles for all related updates. Sign up to our email on [/chain](/chain \'Push Chain Email Signup\') to stay up to date with available resources.\\n\\n### Where can I find more information and stay updated on Push Chain\'s progress?\\n\\nThe best way to stay on top of Push Chain\u2019s progress is through the official Push channels: website, [Twitter/X](https://x.com/PushChain \'Push Protocol on X\'), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject \'Push Protocol on Telegram\'), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol \'Push Protocol on Discord\').\\n\\nAlways remain cautious of phishing links, websites or any scam links asking you for your crypto.

By leveraging features like dynamic sharding, parallel block execution, and true scale, Push Chain promises a seamless environment for universal applications. This blog explores the benchmarking results of Push Chain under varying node configurations, providing insights into how the network behaves and scales as the number of nodes increases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Node Types and Roles\\n\\n- **Validator Nodes:** Responsible for handling transaction validation and serving as the primary interface for client interactions.\\n- **Storage Nodes:** Tasked with storing validated transactions in a sharded manner for optimized data access and storage efficiency.\\n- **Archival Nodes:** Maintain a comprehensive record of all network transactions, enabling historical data access and providing support for applications like blockchain explorers.\\n\\n> \ud83d\udca1 Note: While the roles described above provide a high-level overview, nodes in the Push Chain Network perform significantly more complex tasks, including dynamic sharding, transaction propagation, and ensuring data consistency across the network.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Benchmarking Setup\\n\\nThe benchmarking tests were conducted in controlled environments with different node configurations:\\n\\n### Environment Configurations\\n\\n1. **Configuration 1**:\\n   - **5 Validator Nodes**, **8 Storage Nodes**, **5 Archival Nodes**.\\n   - **2 CPU cores** allocated.\\n2. **Configuration 2**:\\n   - **10 Validator Nodes**, **8 Storage Nodes**, **5 Archival Nodes**.\\n   - **4 CPU cores** allocated.\\n3. **Configuration 3**:\\n   - **20 Validator Nodes**, **8 Storage Nodes**, **5 Archival Nodes**.\\n   - **8 CPU cores** allocated.\\n\\nThe benchmarks primarily evaluate the performance of the **validator nodes**, which serve as the gateway for client interactions. However, since validator nodes interact with storage nodes and archival nodes internally, the results effectively reflect the performance of the entire network.\\n\\n> \u26a1 **Note on** **Controlled Environment:** All of these benchmarks were performed in a controlled internal network environment. As a result, any network lags or latency typically observed in real-world public networks were kept to a minimum, ensuring that the results reflect the network\u2019s inherent capabilities rather than external factors. This setup allows for more accurate measurement of the Push Chain Network\u2019s performance under varying configurations without the interference of significant network delays.\\n\\n> \ud83d\udcca **Note on CPU Scaling:** In order to simulate a decentralized network more realistically, the number of CPU cores allocated scales proportionally with the number of nodes. For instance, 2 CPU cores are allocated for 5 validator nodes, 4 CPU cores for 10 nodes, and 8 CPU cores for 20 nodes. This approach mirrors how resources would likely be distributed in a decentralized system, where each node operator contributes computational resources to the network.\\n\\n> \u2699\ufe0f **Note on Node Configuration:** For simplicity and consistency, the number of **Storage Nodes** and **Archival Nodes** is kept constant at **8** and **5**, respectively, across all configurations. This ensures that the focus remains on evaluating the performance of the **Validator Nodes** and their interactions with the network, without introducing additional variables.\\n\\nThe benchmarks primarily evaluate the performance of the **validator nodes**, which serve as the gateway for client interactions. However, since validator nodes interact with storage nodes and archival nodes internally, the results effectively reflect the performance of the entire network.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Benchmark Results\\n\\nThe following tests were conducted to measure the performance of the Push Chain Network under varying configurations, focusing on the behavior of **validator nodes** as the number of nodes increases. Each test was performed using multiple parallel threads, simulating real-world scenarios where multiple users interact with the network simultaneously.\\n\\n### 1. Ping Validator Test\\n\\nThis test measures the round-trip time taken by multiple threads to select and ping a random validator node, simulating basic connectivity under increasing load.\\n\\n| **Threads** | **Configuration 1** | **Configuration 2** | **Configuration 3** |\\n| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |\\n| 10          | 21.72 ms            | 27.96 ms            | 26.43 ms            |\\n| 50          | 296.98 ms           | 94.45 ms            | 124.54 ms           |\\n| 100         | 371.32 ms           | 137.20 ms           | 151.44 ms           |\\n| 250         | 396.70 ms           | 232.06 ms           | 209.23 ms           |\\n| 500         | 497.69 ms           | 342.74 ms           | 287.24 ms           |\\n| 1000        | 785.19 ms           | 705.11 ms           | 545.10 ms           |\\n| 2000        | 1498.14 ms          | 1245.16 ms          | 1085.70 ms          |\\n| 5000        | 5608.33 ms          | 3637.42 ms          | 3297.24 ms          |\\n| 10000       | **Errored Out**     | **Errored Out**     | **Errored Out**     |\\n\\n**Observations:**\\n\\n- As the number of validator nodes increases, the network handles higher traffic more efficiently, as seen in **Configuration 3**, which consistently shows the lowest response times across all thread counts.\\n- Traffic is split among more validator nodes in configurations with higher node counts, reducing the load on individual nodes and improving overall response times.\\n- At **10,000 threads**, all configurations errored out, indicating the upper limit of the network under the current setup.

This configuration exhibited the best performance across most tests, showcasing the network\u2019s ability to scale efficiently without sacrificing speed. The benefits of **dynamic sharding** ensured that even as the network grew, the system maintained fast response times, handling multiple concurrent threads effectively.\\n- **Performance Bottlenecks:** While performance remained strong as the node count grew, the network did experience timeouts and errors at higher thread counts. This indicates that, although the system can scale, there are throughput limits at extreme loads. However, **Configuration 3** was able to handle a larger volume of requests compared to smaller configurations, validating the advantages of scaling up the number of validator nodes. Given that the **goal of the Push Chain Network** is to scale up to **100,000 validator nodes**, the throughput limits observed at high thread counts are just the beginning. As the network grows, these limits would become significantly larger, making the network capable of handling a vastly higher volume of requests.\\n- **Real-World Application:** The results illustrate how the Push Chain Network becomes more scalable as nodes are added, making it a robust solution for future consumer-centric applications where network demands will increase.\\n\\nThese benchmarks offer valuable insights into the scaling behaviour of the Push Chain Network, demonstrating its readiness to support growing adoption and demanding workloads. Moving forward, continued optimizations in areas like transaction propagation, parallel processing, and sharding will further enhance the network\u2019s performance, enabling it to handle even higher loads.\\n\\n---"},{"id":"randomized-node-selection-push-chain","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/randomized-node-selection-push-chain","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-09-randomized-node-selection-push-chain/index.md","title":"\ud83d\udc4b Randomized Parallel Validators of Push Chain","description":"\ud83d\udc4b Randomized Parallel Validators of Push Chain","date":"2024-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 9, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Chain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-chain"},{"label":"Push Chain Nodes","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-chain-nodes"},{"label":"Parallel Validators","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/parallel-validators"}],"readingTime":4.633333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"randomized-node-selection-push-chain","title":"\ud83d\udc4b Randomized Parallel Validators of Push Chain","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"\ud83d\udc4b Randomized Parallel Validators of Push Chain","text":"One of the defining aspects of decentralized networks is their lack of a central authority to govern how they operate.

Instead, these networks rely on a set of rules and systems to securely communicate and reach consensus on the overall state of the network.\\n\\nAchieving this is no small task. It involves many essential components that ensure the network remains secure and fair, and among the most critical of these is **randomness**.\\n\\nAt its core, randomness is the absence of patterns or predictability in events. It\'s what makes a dice roll uncertain, ensures fairness in games, and strengthens the cryptographic algorithms that secure modern systems. In decentralized networks, randomness serves as a cornerstone of security and fairness, helping to prevent bias and manipulation.\\n\\nIn this article, we delve into the importance of randomness in decentralized networks and explore how Push Nodes use randomness to bolster the security of the Push Chain.\\n\\n## Why do we need Randomness?\\n\\nTo begin with, let\u2019s explore why randomness is so important in decentralized networks.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, decentralized networks lack a central authority. Instead, they rely on a distributed group of nodes spread across the globe. These nodes are responsible for performing various actions to ensure the network remains operational.\\n\\nFor the network to stay secure and fair, the selection of nodes for specific tasks must happen in a decentralized and unbiased manner. This is where **randomness** becomes crucial.\\n\\nIn decentralized systems, randomness ensures unpredictability in key processes, such as selecting validators or generating cryptographic keys. This unpredictability is vital to prevent malicious actors from manipulating the system or gaining undue control. For example, in consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake, the random selection of validators ensures that no single participant can dominate the process, preserving the network\'s decentralized nature.\\n\\nRandomness also strengthens the resilience of blockchains by making it harder for attackers to predict or influence outcomes. This unpredictability guards against attacks like **Sybil attacks** (where adversaries create fake identities) or **collusion** (where groups conspire to take control of the network).\\n\\nAdditionally, randomness plays a key role in promoting fairness. It ensures that every participant in the network has an equal chance to contribute and benefit, regardless of their resources or influence.\\n\\nWith this understanding of how crucial randomness is, let\u2019s explore how Push Nodes leverage randomness to enhance the security and fairness of the Push Chain.\\n\\n## A Glance at Push Nodes\\n\\n[Push Nodes](https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes/)\xa0are a significant step towards the decentralized infrastructure for web3\u2019s leading communication layer, Push Network. This network is designed to facilitate secure and efficient movement of web3 notifications.\\n\\nThe Push Chain comprises different types of nodes such as Validator Nodes, Storage Nodes, and Archival Nodes. A smart contract guards the network to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the PUSH token is used.\\n\\n## How Randomness Is Used to Enhance the Security of Push Chain\\n\\nIn this section, we will specifically understand the complete mechanism of how a transaction is submitted onto Push Chain and the role of randomness involved in the process.\\n\\nIn the Push Chain, the role of randomization is incorporated at multiple levels which allows the network to prevent centralization while ensuring that it remains resilient against a variety of attacks.\\n\\nA crucial security mechanism of the Push Chain is the randomized selection of validators for transaction validation or block production. This mechanism leverages cryptographic randomness to ensure an unpredictable selection of validators &\xa0attestants (who verify whether or not a transaction is legit) to enhance the network\u2019s resilience and fairness.\\n\\n**A brief overview of the process looks something like this:**\\n\\n- To send a transaction to the network, the SDK/sender must attach a randomly generated token number to the transaction.\\n- To fetch this token, the SDK can request the same from any validator.\\n- Once received, the SDK attaches this token to the transaction and sends it to the network.\\n- The network then uses this random token to cryptographically decide the specific validator to verify the particular transaction for further processing.\\n- Additionally, the validator also randomly decides the validator set responsible for attesting to the transaction.\\n\\n## Now, let\u2019s dive deeper into the Randomness of the Push Chain:\\n\\nThe Push SDK selects a random validator (VR1) to generate a special signed (RANDX) hex token.\\n\\nThe generation is performed as follows:\\n\\n### 1. **Generation of a Random Token:**\\n\\nThe network is designed to ensure that a random token cannot merely be generated by a single validator. Instead, it must be a combined effort as every random token is ideally a collection of digitally signed pieces of random numbers provided by specific validators in the network.\\n\\nTo determine the exact number of such pieces required to form the token, the Validator.sol smart contract defines a parameter called\xa0`required_random_number`. This indicates the number of required random peers whose signed values each validator must hold, at a given time. Additionally, the contract also defines an\xa0`expiration_time`\xa0parameter that defines the expiry time for these tokens which helps ensure that only freshly created tokens can be used for the creation of random tokens.\\n\\nIt should be kept in mind that validators in the network periodically ping their peers to collect and exchange signed random values. The collected value from each validator is a combination of the random value itself and the validator\'s signature, ensuring it can be verifiable.\\n\\n```jsx\\nsignedRandomValue = value + validatorSignature;\\n```\\n\\nAs a result, at any given moment the validators should have a collection of signed random values by their peers, i.e.,\xa0**`signedRandomValue[].`**\\n\\nOnce a validator has accumulated the necessary signed random values, it can generate the random token. This token is derived from the network\'s collective randomness using the following formula:\\n\\n```jsx\\nRANDX_Token = XOR(sha(signedRandomValue[i]))for all i\\n\\n```\\n\\n### 2. **The SDK Requests for a Random Token**\\n\\n    Next, now let\u2019s understand what happens when the SDK requests for a random token.\\n\\n    As previously mentioned, before sending any transaction to the network, the SDK\xa0requests for a random token that must be attached with the transaction being sent.\\n\\n    Now, since a random token value has already been generated (as mentioned in step 1), any validator can provide this random token to the SDK.\\n\\n    The SDK then attaches this random token to the transaction payloads and sends the transaction to the network.\\n\\n### 3. **Randomized Selection of Validators**\\n\\n    This random token attached to the transaction plays a crucial role in randomly deciding which validator will process the transaction. With this token, the SDK deciphers the validator ID, to whom it must send the transaction for further processing.\\n\\n    ```jsx\\n    validator_id = f( RANDX_TOKEN, contract_defaults)\\n\\n    //OUTPUT looks like:\\n    validator_id = v1\\n\\n    where contractdefault parameters could be:\\n    a. min required quantity of random numbers,\\n    b. expiration time,\\n    c. a minimum number of peers that acknowledge the validator\'s online status.\\n\\n    ```\\n\\n    Upon receiving the transaction, the validator checks the random token in the transaction\u2019s payload and validates it to confirm that it has been correctly assigned the role of handling this transaction.\\n\\n    In case the validator identifies that it has been wrongly chosen,\xa0**_it can reject the transaction._**\\n\\n    Once the accurate assignment of the validator is confirmed, the validator now creates a similar randomized process for creating a list of validators who must attest to the transaction being processed.\\n\\n    ```jsx\\n    vlist = f(RANDX_Token_2nd, contract_defaults);\\n\\n    // Output looks like this:\\n    (vlist = V2), V50, V11, V8, V38, V17, V29;\\n    ```\\n\\n    This list of validators is also responsible for verifying its\xa0**legitimacy.**\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nTo summarize, the entire process detailed above adds a security layer with the inclusion of randomization at multiple levels, i.e.:\\n\\n- **1st Level:**\xa0The initial randomization starts with the SDK choosing any random validator to request for a token to be attached to the transaction.\\n- **2nd Level: A token is generated**\xa0using digitally signed pieces of random values from multiple random validators instead of relying on any single actor.\\n- **3rd Level: A specific validator is randomly selected**\xa0to create the token to be attached before the transaction occurs.\\n- **4th Level:**\xa0The final level of randomization determines which specific validator (VR2) will process a transaction and which validator set will act as attestants to verify the transaction.\\n\\nThis multi-level randomness ensures that at every step, the network is secure, and fair, while continuing to operate in a completely decentralized fashion.\\n\\n---"},{"id":"understand-proof-of-stake-and-push-chain","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/understand-proof-of-stake-and-push-chain","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-09-understand-proof-of-stake-and-push-chain/index.md","title":"Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS","description":"Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS","date":"2024-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 9, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Chain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-chain"},{"label":"Proof of Stake","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/proof-of-stake"},{"label":"Push Chain Nodes","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-chain-nodes"}],"readingTime":5.19,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"understand-proof-of-stake-and-push-chain","title":"Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS","text":"In a globally distributed computing environment, achieving collective agreement on the true state of the system has always been a complex challenge.","tags":["Push Chain","Proof of Stake","Push Chain Nodes"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"\ud83d\udc4b Randomized Parallel Validators of Push Chain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/randomized-node-selection-push-chain"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why PUSH Chain?","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/why-push-chain"}},"content":"![Cover Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nIn a globally distributed computing environment, achieving collective agreement on the true state of the system has always been a complex challenge.\\n\\nFortunately, there are algorithms (_specialized instructions_) that assist in preserving this \u2018single-truth-state\u2019 while balancing network security, long-term sustainability, and economic incentives.\\n\\nSuch algorithms in the web3 space, are popularly known as Consensus Algorithms.\\n\\nThis article is the only guide you will need to know about - What Proof of Stake is, its significance and how does it work.\\n\\n## Proof of Stake - A quick overview:\\n\\nProof of Stake is a consensus algorithm used to secure blockchain networks where block producers (validators) are chosen based on the number of tokens they\'re willing to \\"stake\\" or lock up as collateral.\\n\\nValidators are incentivised to act honestly, since, any malicious behaviour would result in them losing their staked assets.\\n\\n![First Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image1.webp)\\n\\nValidators are nodes responsible for securing the network by performing two key actions:\\n\\n- Proposing new blocks - containing transactions.\\n- Attestation - Examining and voting on the blocks proposed by other validators\\n\\nNow that we have a basic understanding about the PoS, lets go down the rabbit hole to know more about it.\\n\\n## Why do we need PoS?\\n\\nEach network is based on some foundational philosophies.\\n\\nBitcoin popularly known for its PoW (Proof of Work) algorithm is based on the principal of earning the right to validate by demonstrating computational work.\\n\\nChains like Ethereum, Solana and Push Chain are predominantly based on the philosophies of \u201cProving value to validate and earn incentives at the risk of commitment and economic loss\u201d\\n\\nThis proves your commitment towards the network by staking tokens to participate in network\u2019s consensus with the risk of being penalized for jeopardizing the network\u2019s security.\\n\\n### Ease of Entry:\\n\\nStaking makes it easier for individuals to participate in securing the network, promoting decentralization.\\n\\nAn Ethereum validator node could be easily run on a normal laptop.\\n\\n### Energy Efficiency:\\n\\n- PoS networks are highly energy efficient in terms of cost of operations and compute consumption.\\n\\n- PoS eliminates the energy-intensive mining computations of PoW, replacing them with a stake-based validator selection process that requires only basic network communication and transaction validation operations.\\n\\n![Second Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image2.webp)\\n\\n![Third Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image3.webp)\\n\\n### Stake to participate:\\n\\nIn PoS networks, influence is tied to economical commitment instead of computational power.\\n\\nParticipants (validators) pledge their assets (stake) in exchange for the right to participate in the network\u2019s consensus.\\n\\nThus, creating a relationship that equally benefits the interests of the validators as well as the collective network.\\n\\n_The equation only stands true until the validators stay true to their commitments._\\n\\n### Skin in the game:\\n\\nThe success of a PoS network hinges on the honesty of its validators.\\n\\nValidators are required to deposit (stake) the networks native currency in adequate quantities to participate in the block creation.\\n\\nValidators risk losing their staked assets _(getting slashed_ \\\\*) if they attempt to game the system for their personal gains by :\\n\\n- Approving fraudulent transactions\\n- Censoring incoming transactions.\\n- Failing to participate\\n- Sending conflicting attestations\\n- Proposing multiple blocks in a single slot (aka Equivocating)\\n\\nAs the network grows, the cost to attack it increases proportionally.\\n\\nThe amount of tokens slashed varies with every network.\\n\\nTo know about slashing values for Push Chain - visit the [Push Chain Governance Proposal](https://gov.push.org).\\n\\n### Scalability:\\n\\nIn PoS the block creation is a process of \u201c**probabilistic election**\u201d rather than \u201c**computation competition**\u201d.\\n\\nSince time taken to elect a validator is significantly less, block creation frequency is (arguably) much higher than PoW networks, significantly boosting transaction speeds and scalability.\\n\\n### Security and Resilience:\\n\\nAs highlighted earlier, in a PoS network, the cost to attack increases proportionally with the network\u2019s growth.\\n\\nA 51% attack\u2014where malicious actors gain control of 51% of staked coins to reverse transactions and manipulate block confirmations becomes increasingly impractical and expensive as the network grows and the token prices rises (ideally).\\n\\nDominic Williams, Founder of ICP, outlines three critical elements of Sybil resistance in his paper\\n\\n\u2018[Sybil-resistant Network Identities From Dedicated Hardware](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eRTAe3szuIoZEloHvRMtZlrU7t2un4UVQ8LarpU3LNk/edit?tab=t.0)\u2019\\n\\n- **Entry Cost:** The expense required to participate.\\n- **Existence Cost**: Ongoing costs to maintain participation.\\n- **Exit Penalty**: The penalties for leaving or misbehaving\\n\\n![Fourth Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image4.webp)\\n\\nPoW chains like Bitcoin does not have an Exit Penalty mechanism to punish the validators for deterring the integrity of network. But PoS chains, like Push Chain cover all the bases, ensuring stricter sybil resistance.\\n\\n## How does Proof of Stake work?\\n\\nThe Proof of Stake (PoS) process operates in three key phases:\\n\\n1. **Validator Selection**\\n2. **Block Creation and Validation**\\n3. **Finalization**\\n\\n### **Validator Selection:**\\n\\n![Fifth Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image5.webp)\\n\\nValidator Selection forms the backbone of PoS, where nodes participate by staking the network\u2019s native currency into a deposit contract. The staked amount must meet or exceed a predetermined threshold or lowerbound (e.g., 32 ETH for Ethereum).\\n\\nTo propose a block, the probability of validators getting elected is directly proportional to the staked amount relative to the total coins staked across the network.\\n\\n### **Block creation:**\\n\\nTimekeeping is critical in PoS, structured through two key units: **Slot** and **Epoch.**\\n\\n- A slot - is a fixed duration of time that varies network to network (1 slot = 12 sec in Ethereum and 400ms in Solana).\\n- **Epoch**: A cycle comprising multiple slots (e.g., 32 slots in Ethereum)\\n\\nSlots are sequential and occur one after other in a linear manner.\\n\\n(_But not in case of Push Chain - More on this later_)\\n\\nEach slot is assigned to a randomly chosen validator, selected through specialized algorithms like RANDAO in Ethereum and VDF - Verifiable Delay Function in Solana.\\n\\nWithin their slot duration, validators are responsible for tasks:\\n\\n- Package transactions into a block\\n- Verify their validity\\n- Initiate the process of propagating the block across the network.\\n\\n![Sixth Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image6.webp)\\n\\n### **Validation and Finalization**\\n\\nOnce a block is proposed, a committee of a defined number of validators is randomly chosen to vote on the validity of the block by careful examining of its contents - This process is called as attestation.\\n\\n**Attestation Weight**: Each vote is weighted based on the validator\u2019s stake.\\n\\n**Confirmation**: A block is finalized when at least 2/3 of the total staked tokens sign off on its validity, ensuring a strong consensus.\\n\\n![Seventh Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image7.webp)\\n\\n### Edge cases:\\n\\n- **Missed Blocks** - Instances when a validator fails to propose a block within their slot, it results in a missed block.\\n- **Orphaned Blocks** - These occur when a block is rejected by the validating committee or during a chain fork. Orphaned blocks represent alternative versions of chain history that are not followed by majority of network.\\n\\nIn summary, this is how the entire process would look like:\\n\\n![Eigth Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image8.webp)\\n\\n## How Push Nodes use PoS?\\n\\nPush Chain - is a Proof of Stake shared state blockchain for shared app experiences designed to support the development of **hyper-scalable, consumer-centric, universal web3 applications.**\\n\\nPush Chain enables txs from any chain (Solana, Eth, EVM, or non-EVM) with fast finality of < 1 second. It has the ability to scale infinitely as nodes increase, supporting tens of thousands of parallel transactions\\n\\n- Any Chain Tx \u26d3\ufe0f\\n- Fee & Wallet Abstraction \ud83d\udcb0\xa0\ud83d\udd10\\n- Parallel Validation and Dynamic Sharding \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\\n- Consumer tx (unordered) and Traditional tx (ordered)\\n- Universal Smart Contract \ud83c\udf10\\n- Shared App Experience \ud83e\udd1d\\n\\nPush Chain uses an innovative approach towards tweaking its consensus mechanism in order to incorporate its multi-node architecture and ability to support both, ordered and un-ordered blocks with parallel validation.\\n\\nPush Chain distributes responsibilities across three specialized node types:\\n\\n**Validator Nodes** - Forms the backbone of the network, handling transaction validation and block production.\\n\\n**Storage Nodes** - Manage the network\'s data through dynamic sharding, enabling efficient distribution and retrieval. Storage Nodes work in sync with validators to ensure data availability and decentralization.\\n\\n**Archival Nodes** - Serve as the network\'s historical record keepers, storing complete transaction logs and providing WebSocket functionality for real-time data access and analytics.\\n\\nOptimised for hyper scalable consumer apps - Push Chain introduces **stateless blocks** with parallel execution for faster processing and validation of non-value consumer data transactions.\\n\\nFor selecting block validators - the system uses a multi-level randomization process to avoid validator collusion during parallel block processing.\\n\\nMore details about the randomization mechanism can be found in the [Push Chain Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.push.org).\\n\\nTo maintain the network\u2019s economical integrity Push Chain has a modified penalising mechanism which includes the act of \u2018Reporting\u2019. It acts like a warning to correct the node\u2019s behaviour instead of simply slashing and banning the node instantly.\\n\\n![Ninth Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS](./image9.webp)\\n\\nThere are a lot more novel and interesting elements that make Push Chain a powerful choice for building Universal Apps.

However, practically, there\u2019s an evident misalignment where today\u2019s web3 infrastructure is more optimized for financial use cases.\\n\\nFinancial apps and consumer-centric apps (_e.g. social, gaming, etc_) inherently have different infrastructure needs:\\n\\nFinance-specific apps require:\\n\\n- _A high level of security,_\\n- _Strict transaction and block ordering,_\\n- _Prioritization of state accuracy and finality over speed, etc._\\n\\nOn the flip side consumer apps require more flexible models that emphasize:\\n\\n- _Hyper scalability_\\n- _Low latency_\\n- _Simplified UX_\\n- _Affordability_\\n- _Support for both ordered and unordered transactions ( a.k.a, consumer transactions, as we call it )_\\n\\nWeb3 ecosystem is heavily skewed towards financial applications. The bias is evident in the rise of projects centered around trading, lending, staking, perps, and similar use cases.\\n\\nSuch finance-centric infrastructure forces consumer apps to make suboptimal compromises impacting their performance and usability.\\n\\nEven the advent of app-specific chains hasn\u2019t fully resolved these tradeoffs.\\n\\nFor instance, the [**State of Crypto 2024**](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2024/) report by a16z highlights how on-chain games running on dedicated rollups are struggling to keep up with the increasing user demand, straining the network and as a result consuming multifolds of M/gas (_mega gas per second_) as compared to Ethereum.\\n\\n![First Image of Why Push Chain](./image1.webp)\\n\\nConsumer-centric apps, which could appeal to broader audiences, are still in their infancy compared to the much more mature and sophisticated DeFi sector.\\n\\nThis focus on finance has led to a situation where the average user might view web3 as a playground for traders and investors rather than a tool for everyday life.\\n\\nThe report from a16z also provides another key insight:\\n\\n![Second Image of Why Push Chain](./image2.webp)\\n\\n**Out of ~617 million global crypto users, only 5-10% (30-60 million) users actively transact!**\\n\\nBarriers to entry, the dilemma of choosing the right chain, and multiple points of friction in UX could reasonably be attributed as causes of the growing share of dormant users.\\n\\n![Third Image of Why Push Chain](./image3.webp)\\n\\nVitalik in his [recent talk at Devcon](https://youtu.be/ei3tDRMjw6k?si=w1kYuzgR0ho-90Eb&t=1775) (timestamp: 29:35) emphasized the need for building both non-financial and mixed financial applications.\\n\\n### **Fragmentation of chains is a major blocker towards overall web3 UX improvement**\\n\\nWith Vitalik\u2019s conception of the _Rollup-Centric Roadmap, back in 2020,_ Ethereum pivoted towards rollups as their scaling strategy - as **bundling multiple transactions**\xa0**into batches**\xa0significantly increased\xa0**_transaction throughput_**\xa0and\xa0**_reduced transaction costs._**\\n\\nThis solved Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues effectively and led to an abundance of _L2 and L3 chains._\\n\\nHowever, the joyous ride is now hitting some rough bumps.\\n\\n### UX Fragmentation\\n\\n_Clutter is the Enemy of Clarity._\\n\\nWith each additional step spent completing an action, including switching between networks, time spent in choosing the right chain, protocol, or wallet, decreases [_Psych_ - a unit of measure for motivation to complete an action.](https://andrewchen.com/psychd-funnel-conversion/)\\n\\nHere is a quick glance at what a typical web3 user needs to deal with in this multi-chain universe:\\n\\n- Managing multiple wallets,\\n- Managing multiple native tokens/assets in their multiple wallets,\\n- Understanding the nuances of each network,\\n- Navigating multiple networks to perform simple tasks,\\n- Interacting with complicated dapp UIs with frequent network switching\\n- Navigate through inconsistent user interfaces\\n- Relying on the risky route of cross-chain bridging between chains\\n- Experiencing difficulty in maintaining a consistent cross-chain identity due to the multi-chain ecosystem\\n- Dealing with the lack of standardization between networks, protocols, etc\\n- Dealing with the learning curve of understanding different networks, each with its own set of rules, interfaces, and requirements.\\n\\nRemember that this is just a glance at the UX problem.\\n\\nThere are undoubtedly more issues for a web3 user daily. The list is even longer when it comes to newbie web3 users.\\n\\n![Fourth Image of Why Push Chain](./image4.webp)\\n\\n### User Retention Challenges\\n\\nPoor UX can directly impact user retention.\\n\\nTruth be told, it already is impacting user retention.\\n\\nWhen users encounter difficulties in navigating the web3 ecosystem, they are less likely to return to it. High-profile dApps that have struggled with user retention due to UX issues serve as cautionary tales for new projects entering the space. Complex interfaces, slow transaction times, and confusing wallet setups have all contributed to a decline in user engagement and adoption.\\n\\n### **Security and Trust Concerns**\\n\\nThe complexity of managing multiple chains also introduces security risks.\\n\\nUsers must ensure that they are interacting with the correct chain, using the right wallet, and understanding the implications of each transaction. This complexity increases the likelihood of user errors, such as sending assets to the wrong address or falling victim to phishing attacks.\\n\\nFurthermore, the process of bridging assets between these chains is quite often cumbersome and fraught with risks. Users must rely on various bridging protocols, which not only add to the complexity but also introduce potential security vulnerabilities. For instance, a user willing to move tokens from Ethereum to an L2 solution must navigate multiple steps, including wrapping and unwrapping tokens, which can be a deterrent for new users.\\n\\n### **Increased Complexity for Builders:**\\n\\nEach chain often has its own development tools, SDKs, and environments that developers must learn & adapt to, which can be time-consuming and lead to inconsistencies in development practices. Maintaining applications that operate across multiple chains requires managing multiple codebases or conditional code paths. This can lead to significant maintenance overhead, especially when chains update their protocols or APIs.\\n\\nEach additional chain integrated into an application introduces new potential vulnerabilities. Developers must ensure that the security of cross-chain interactions is robust, as any weakness could lead to exploits or hacks.\\n\\nFurthermore, developing for a multi-chain ecosystem that still lacks adequate standardization - is costly. It requires more time and resources, as developers need to learn and implement different protocols, test on multiple platforms, and ensure compatibility across the whole environment involved. The additional cost of extensive security audits makes the process of building & maintaining apps even more difficult.\\n\\nThere is no one size fits all solution, nor is there a way to restrict the proliferation of chains.\\n\\n**_But what if there was a way to unify every fragmented state under one shared state?_**\\n\\n### **A shared state chain is needed that can enable shared app experiences**\\n\\nLet\u2019s dive a bit further into the complexities of multi-chain web3 world.\\n\\nWhile fragmented UX is definitely a concern, there are more.\\n\\nThere are over 30 Layer 1s, 120 Layer 2s and soon thousands of Layer 3 chains.\\nImagine the sheer number of DApps deployed on all of these chains!\\n\\nNewer chains have led to the rise of siloed environments having limited or zero awareness of each others state - even Ethereum!\\n\\nThe majority of these apps still operate within closed systems. Contracts pertaining to each chain store states in an isolated manner leaving little opportunity for users for a unified experience. Siloed environments in turn add more interop complexities forcing developers to **shift price-sensitive apps** to app-sensitive infrastructure, further affecting the UX and escalating fragmentation.\\n\\nHere is a quick look at Vitalik and Justin Drake talking about the same issues:\\n\\n![Fifth Image of Why Push Chain](./image5.webp)\\n\\n![Sixth Image of Why Push Chain](./image6.webp)\\n\\nWith such an extent of liquidity, state and UX fragmentation, it becomes troublesome for web3 apps/users to seamlessly interact with apps on multiple chains. In fact, in order to move assets or payloads between chains, a user is often exposed to the on-chain intricacies and risks to achieve simple tasks.\\n\\nFor instance, a use with governance token on chain A cannot vote on any proposal of the same protocol on chain B as there is no unified system to support this activity. As a result, every app on a specific chain becomes its own siloed state.\\n\\nThis leads to an issue where there is no unified infra for apps to be built on. And there is a shared app experience for users to just use apps without having to worry about the underlying chains, finality risks, bridging or facing complicated UX.\\n\\nSo far, we have discussed the concerns.\\n\\nLet\u2019s now understand what is Push Chain and how it helps us resolve these concerns.\\n\\n## Enter Push Chain\\n\\nPush Chain is a shared state blockchain for shared app experience.\\n\\nIt is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain built to allow developers to create scalable and universal apps and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s and L3s. It is designed to allow transactions from any chain, use fee abstraction to avoid the strict requirement of native gas tokens for multiple chains and provide wallet abstraction for seamless onboarding and signing for any user.\\n\\nIt also introduces a new transaction type which we define as consumer transactions (where ordering is not important) to enable non-financial apps to have the speed and scalability which any consumer app requires. It leverages new mechanisms like parallel block execution and dynamic sharding to enable true scaling, and providing the perfect environment for any consumer app or universal app to thrive in the era of fragmented chains.\\n\\n![Seventh Image of Why Push Chain](./image7.webp)\\n\\nPush chain aims to solve some of the critical concerns in web3 today, as previously explained, and it plans to solve them in 3 specific phases. Each of these phases tackle a particular problem and eventually leads us to our core vision of achieving a shared app experience for web3 and enable universal apps with enhanced UX.\\n\\nMentioned below are the 3 main phases:\\n\\n1. **Phase-1:** To enable consumer-centric apps with hyper scalability, fee abstraction, wallet abstraction and any chain transactions.\\n2. **Phase-2:** To enable seamless interoperability between chains for apps and users.  \\n   (_An intermediary phase to enable the universal smart contracts and shared state_)\\n3. **Phase-3:** To enable universal smart contracts and shared state in order to make other chain\u2019s state accessible on Push Chain and unlocking the era of universal apps.\\n\\nNow, let\u2019s understand each of the above-mentioned concerns and explore how Push Chain aims to resolve them.\\n\\n1. **The Concerns with Consumer-Specific App**\\n\\n   So far we have explored why building and using consumer-specific web3 apps is difficult.\\n\\n   However, let\u2019s now dive deep to first understand what exactly does a consumer-app required and how Push Chain completes those requirements.\\n\\n   Some of the main requirements of a consumer-centric applications are:\\n\\n   1. **Simplified User-Onboarding:** Apps required seamless onboarding and intuitive user interface. In simpler terms, this indicates that applications should be so easy to use that the user should never have to learn the intricacies of the underlying technology stack.\\n\\n      However, its not the case in web3. The intuitiveness ends the moment users are required to _set up a web3 wallet and remember the mnemonics_. This means the very first step a user is required to do for using web3 apps will most likely be the most difficult step in itself.\\n\\n      Once the user enters the rabbit hole of using a web3 app, they are then required to either _choose a chain, sign a transaction, collect and manage native gas tokens of the respective chain, switch between different chains, bridge tokens, etc._ The list goes on and **_the further you explore, the harder the UX._**\\n\\n      With Wallet Abstraction, Push Chain aims to enable seamless user onboarding without going through the manual and complicated procedure of setting up a web3 wallet.\\n\\n      ![Eigth Image of Why Push Chain](./image8.webp)\\n\\n      Wallet abstraction addresses challenges by removing the need for direct mnemonic management. Instead, Push Chain allows users to authenticate using familiar methods like _social logins, email, or phone numbers._ This system abstracts away the complexity of mnemonic custody by securely managing a master key pair on behalf of the user, while still ensuring they retain ultimate control.\\n\\n      The Push wallet can dynamically derive blockchain-specific keys from the master key pair, enabling seamless interaction across multiple blockchain networks. By simplifying wallet operations and providing a unified experience, wallet abstraction reduces friction, enhances usability, and makes blockchain technology more accessible without compromising security.\\n\\n      > _The whitepaper explains the Key Management and technical aspects around keys in greater detail. Check it out here_\\n\\n   2. **Instant Finality & Scalability:** A consumer-centric app needs to support a large number of users without compromising performance. Additionally, it needs to support instant finality so that users experience a similar speed as in traditional apps.\\n\\n      Although layer 2 solutions and rollups aim to address scalability, the current state of web3 still struggles to match the speed and efficiency of traditional centralized systems. For a consumer-centric app, any delay in processing or finalizing transactions will lead to a poor user experience.\\n\\n      **Push Chain** is designed to solve this with its instant finality as well as its support for unordered transactions, a.k.a, consumer transactions.\\n\\n      A consumer transaction can be defined as the type of transaction that doesn\'t benefit from the strict ordering as seen in traditional web3 transactions where strict ordering with a nonce is mandatory. These can also be categorized as transfers of consumer data like notifications, emails, blogs, etc that do not require a strict order to be executed.\\n\\n      Since there is no state change for such transactions, they don\u2019t need to change the merkle root of the network and thus can be called **orderless transactions.**\\n\\n      Examples of these transactions can be emails sent from one user to another, posting on social media, writing blogs, creating content, defining user settings for an app, defining user meta-data, storing soft state data for gaming among others.\\n\\n      The chain is designed to facilitate a wide range of consumer transactions, providing a robust and scalable platform for decentralized applications. The transaction model in the Push Chain is tailored to support high-throughput, low-latency operations, ensuring that various applications can interact seamlessly.\\n\\n      **Since scalability is crucial for any application, phase 1** of the Push Chain roadmap includes the development of new optimization such as **parallel block execution and dynamic sharding** to create the true scaling of web3 apps, enabling read and write capabilities that scale as the number of nodes in the network scales, which provides an infrastructure that can handle the needs of thousands of applications related to speed and scalability.\\n\\n   3. **Affordability:** A major pain point of using any app is the associated cost. If an app requires a user to spend a high as well as indeterministic cost every time he/she wishes to use the app - the user will most likely never use it.\\n\\n      Consumers expect low or no fees for transactions within apps, especially non-monetary ones. Gas fees, while necessary to secure the network, are a major barrier to consumer adoption. In web3, transaction fees are often too high for the average consumer; even more so during network congestion. However, solving this has been difficult as there is a always gas fees/network fees associated with any and every action a user might want to take.\\n\\n      **With Push Chain\u2019s Fee Abstraction feature,** we eliminate this problem to a greater extent.\\n\\n      Fee Abstraction is a key feature of this chain that eliminates the friction of requiring to hold native gas strictly in the wallet in use.\\n\\n      Furthermore, a sustainable decentralized network needs to be present in order to ensure the long-term viability of the project. To do this, we propose including a mechanism for having a fee quota.\\n\\n      A user is able to purchase fees in bulk that can then be used by them, delegated to other users / wallets or can even be paid by web3 applications. The key idea behind locking fees in bulk is to ensure that the transaction coming from whatever blockchain network is not limited by the speed of that particular blockchain\u2019s TPS.\\n\\n      Additionally, there is a fallback mechanism that does a graceful conversion using swapper contracts which takes the native token of a specific blockchain and swaps it for Push Chain\u2019s fees.\\n\\n      This ensures that in the event a different chain user doesn\u2019t have enough fees, even then the network is still able to fallback and use that particular blockchain\u2019s native token for the conversion and eventual processing of the transaction. This mechanism ensures that even running out of quota is not a barrier to transaction creation, providing flexibility in payment methods.\\n\\n2. **The Concerns with Multi-Chain Navigation & Fragmented Ecosystem**\\n\\n   As previously stated, a core reason behind difficult UX in web3 is the existence of multiple different chains. Each of these chains offers some key feature but eventually leads to a fragmented ecosystem.\\n\\n   If we observe the space as whole, carefully, it is quite evident that there are two main requirements for apps to navigate such an ecosystem:\\n\\n   - Fast and reliable movement of value and messages between chains ( _for both apps and users )_\\n   - A shared state infrastructure that allows building apps that appear to work seamlessly in a unified fashion and give a **shared app experience** to the user - completely eradicating the complexity of navigating multiple chains for using apps.\\n\\n   If an infrastructure achieves both of these for the apps built on top of it, it can ideally resolve the most difficult UX problem that exists in web3 apps today.\\n\\n   That\u2019s exactly what Push Chain aims to solve in its Phase 2 and 3.\\n\\n   **With Phase 2** of its roadmap, the chain aims to establish seamless interoperability between chains to enable cross-chain features in the apps. The interoperability shall be enabled using a solver network capable of instant cross-chain transactions to ensure better UX. The network shall be designed to move not just value but also arbitrary payloads that seamlessly transfer smart contract calls to other chains.\\n\\n   The main goals of this phase is to:\\n\\n   - Enable fast and reliable movement of messages/assets between chain\\n   - Delegate on-chain intricacies and risks from users to solvers ( _specialized on-chain actors )_\\n\\n   At the point in which both of these goals are accomplished, we will achieve a win for both the users and the apps on top of Push Chain.\\n\\n   **With Phase 3,** we achieve the shared state L1 chain that is capable of supporting universal apps. Most importantly, this phase establishes one of the key features of Push Chain, i.e., **shared app experiences** (with Shared State).\\n\\n   Shared state allows Push Chain to access data from its own chain as well as supported external chains. Combining this with Push ID enables universal smart contracts wherein the smart contracts on Push Chain have access to the state of all of the wallets of the user even if those wallets belong to other chain(s). This enables developers to understand the user and build universal smart contracts to fulfill the user\u2019s need irrespective of what chain(s) the user state is on which ushers countless innovations.\\n\\n   ![Ninth Image of Why Push Chain](./image9.webp)\\n\\n   The feature opens up the entire web3 userbase to be available for a web3 application enabling shared app experiences no matter from what blockchain the user accesses the application. It also makes Push Chain the shared settlement layer for all other chains (EVM / Non-EVM).\\n\\n   This enables developers to completely abstract away any learning from the user, creating an era where a user does not use Uniswap \u201con Ethereum\u201d or Uniswap \u201con Polygon\u201d or Uniswap \u201con Arbitrum\u201d \u2014 but rather simply **uses Uniswap** for its features.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis article was an extensive guide to understanding the need for Push Chain, what it offers, and how it benefits the overall web3 ecosystem.\\n\\nIt is quite evident how the above-mentioned concerns with web3 today is a major blocker behind the growth of consumer-centric web3 apps.\\n\\nWith Push Chain, we aim to resolve each of these blockers and provide an infrastructure dedicated to building and supporting top-notch web3 apps with hyper scalability, enhanced user onboarding, better UX with wallet and fee abstraction, and a shared state L1 chain designed to build universal apps with shared app experience.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1. **Check out the [Push Chain Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.push.org?utm_source=pushblog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pcgov)** for a detailed overview of the vision and the underlying technicalities.\\n2.

Because wallet addresses are public by design, users face risks from unsolicited messages, data mining, and phishing attempts. This challenge requires a secure, private communication layer that preserves the decentralized nature of the blockchain. An effective solution must give users complete control over their data while allowing smooth, private interactions. Push Protocol addresses this need by enhancing privacy in on-chain communications without compromising usability or security.\\n\\n### **End-to-End Encryption: Ensuring Message Privacy**\\n\\nPush ensures that every message exchanged between users remains private, leveraging robust end-to-end encryption. This encryption ensures that only the sender and recipient can access the content, effectively safeguarding sensitive information from prying eyes.\\n\\nWhen users register with Push Chat using their wallet, a unique public-private key pair is generated. This method removes the need for usernames or passwords, ensuring privacy by design. The private key stays securely within the user\u2019s wallet, while the public key allows others to encrypt messages intended for them. For example, when User A sends a message to User B, the message is encrypted with User B\'s public key, ensuring that only User B\u2014holding the corresponding private key\u2014can decrypt and read it.\\n\\nThis process, powered by asymmetric cryptography, guarantees that no third party can intercept or decipher the communication. By placing security and privacy at the core of its design, Push empowers user privacy, even in a decentralized environment.\\n\\n### **PGP Key Security: Your Private Key, Your Privacy**\\n\\nPush takes a decentralized approach to key management by generating and encrypting PGP keys locally on users\' devices. These keys are protected using advanced encryption methods, ensuring only the user can access them. These private keys never leave the user\u2019s control, ensuring that their communication remains secure. This commitment to decentralization ensures that privacy is not a feature to be toggled but a default guarantee for all Push users. Think of it as having your personal safe: only you hold the key, and no one else, not even Push, can open it.\\n\\n### **Anonymous Communication: No Personal Information Required**\\n\\nUnlike traditional platforms that require personal identifiers like email addresses or phone numbers, Push enables wallet-to-wallet messaging. This innovation allows users to communicate anonymously, relying solely on their Web3 wallets for identity. By removing the need for personal identifiers, Push eliminates the common risks of data breaches and misuse of personal information. This feature not only enhances privacy but also aligns with the principles of pseudonymity and anonymity by offering valuable protections and can be used to enhance privacy and security on the blockchain.\\n\\n### **Decentralized Storage with IPFS**\\n\\nPush stores messages securely on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized storage solution that ensures data integrity and security. Using IPFS, Push ensures that data is distributed across multiple nodes, making it nearly impossible for hackers to tamper with or breach.\\n\\nPush\u2019s decentralized infrastructure minimizes security risks like data breaches while providing faster access to data and greater resilience. This approach ensures that even if one node fails, user messages remain accessible and secure, offering uninterrupted service.\\n\\n### **Spam Prevention for Better Privacy**\\n\\nSpam and unwanted messages can be significant privacy concerns. Push mitigates this with chat requests and opt-in notifications, empowering users to control who can contact them. Chat requests allow users to preview messages before accepting them, while opt-in notifications ensure that only chosen channels can send updates. This spam prevention mechanism ensures that users\u2019 communication remains meaningful and free from unnecessary intrusion.\\n\\n### **Privacy in NFT and Token-Gated Groups**\\n\\nPush goes beyond one-on-one messaging by enabling private group chats for NFT and token holders. Access to these groups is determined by ownership of specific NFTs or tokens, creating exclusive spaces for members. This functionality allows users to participate in exclusive communities without revealing personal information. Whether it\u2019s an NFT club or a DAO working group, Push ensures that privacy is maintained across all interactions.\\n\\n### **Cross-Chain Privacy**\\n\\nAs Web3 grows increasingly multi-chain, Push ensures seamless and private communication across blockchain networks. This is achieved using advanced encryption and decentralized architecture, ensuring messages remain secure no matter the blockchain. This cross-chain capability fosters decentralized collaboration while upholding privacy principles in diverse ecosystems.\\n\\n### **The Future of Onchain Communication**\\n\\nPush is setting new standards for privacy in on-chain communications. With powerful end-to-end encryption, decentralized storage, and anonymous messaging, Push delivers secure communication for all users. As Web3 grows, Push remains dedicated to empowering users with privacy tools that make their experience better.\\n\\nIn a world where data is currency, Push protects what matters most\u2014your privacy."},{"id":"monthly-recap-october-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/monthly-recap-october-2024","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-15-monthly-recap-october-2024/index.md","title":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates - October","description":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates - October","date":"2024-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 15, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Updates","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/updates"},{"label":"Announcements","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/announcements"},{"label":"Community & Ecosystem","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/community-ecosystem"}],"readingTime":3.23,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"monthly-recap-october-2024","title":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates - October","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates - October","text":"October has been another outstanding month for Push Protocol, showcasing significant advancements across development, integrations, and community engagement.","tags":["Updates","Announcements","Community & Ecosystem"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How Push Enhances Privacy in On-Chain Communications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ecosystem Integrations: How Push Works with Other Protocols","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/how-push-works-with-other-protocols"}},"content":"![Cover Image of Push Protocol Monthly Updates - October](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nOctober has been another outstanding month for Push Protocol, showcasing significant advancements across development, integrations, and community engagement.

Push Protocol leads the way by providing on-chain notifications that integrate with essential DeFi, social, and DAO platforms. By enabling real-time updates, Push empowers users to stay informed, manage assets, and streamline their activities, supporting the decentralized ecosystem like never before.\u201d Here\'s a look at how Push Protocol works with significant players like Lens Protocol, Hats Protocol, ENS Domains, Hyperliquid, and others to enhance the user experience and bring our decentralized ecosystem into an age of real-time communications.\\n\\n### **Lens Protocol: Real-Time Notifications for Social Engagement**\\n\\nPush Protocol enhances the user experience for Lens Protocol by delivering real-time notifications, creating a more engaging and interactive social ecosystem. Lens users can now receive notifications for critical events on their profiles, such as new followers, likes, and comments. This functionality ensures that users are always informed about activities related to their presence on the platform, making it easier to respond to interactions and engage with their community.\\n\\nThrough Push, Lens allows users to opt-in to receive these notifications directly in their wallets, creating a seamless Web3 experience that feels native and intuitive.\xa0 By keeping users engaged and aware of important updates in real-time, Push helps maintain a lively and responsive social ecosystem within Lens.\\n\\nAs both the official Lens Protocol channel and the Push ecosystem continue to grow, it will be fascinating to see how developers expand upon the existing connections.\\n\\nSubscribe to the [Lens Protocol Channel](https://app.push.org/channels/0xef6426D522CfE5B7Ae5dB05623aB0Ef78023dBe0) \ud83d\udd14\\n\\n### **Hats Protocol: Streamlined, Role-Based DAO Communication**\\n\\nFor DAOs that use Hats Protocol for decentralized role and permission management, Push Protocol offers token-gated group chat integrations. Hats Protocol\'s unique model of assigning \\"hats\\" or roles on-chain means that specific members are granted distinct responsibilities within a DAO. Push enhances this framework by enabling private group chats accessible only to members with particular hats, such as \\"Treasury Manager\\" or \\"Governance Lead.\\"\\n\\nThis integration helps streamline communications within DAOs, ensuring that discussions remain relevant and focused by limiting access to members directly involved. By ensuring that only relevant members are part of each conversation, it increases efficiency and reduces noise, allowing DAOs to make faster, more informed decisions. It strengthens confidentiality and relevance in DAO interactions, keeping sensitive conversations secure and organized by the roles that are assigned by Hats Protocol.\\n\\nWith Hats injected into our token-gated group chats and beyond, we couldn\u2019t be more bullish on the future of all communities. This setup not only improves security but also helps foster more collaborative, transparent and organized environments within DAO and beyond.\\n\\n### **ENS Domains: Ensuring Domain Retention with Expiration Notifications**\\n\\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a system that lets users replace long wallet addresses with easy-to-remember names (Domain Name Service - DNS) on the Ethereum blockchain.\xa0 It is widely used for decentralized identity, allowing users to replace complex wallet addresses with easily recognizable names. However, managing ENS domains can be challenging, especially with expiration dates that can easily be missed.\\n\\nIn the fast paced world, staying on top of your decentralized identity is crucial. ENS Domain represents your identity, and letting them expire could mean losing access to vital services or communities. Push Protocol provides critical notifications for ENS holders when their domains are about to expire, allowing them to take timely action to avoid losing their names.\\n\\nThese notifications are sent straight to the user\u2019s wallet, so they can quickly take action.\xa0 No need to worry about missing emails or alerts elsewhere. This integration with Push enhances the user experience by safeguarding ENS ownership, reducing the risk of accidental lapses, and ensuring that users retain control over their decentralized identities.\\n\\nSubscribe to the [ENS Domains Channel](https://app.push.org/channels/0x983110309620D911731Ac0932219af06091b6744) \ud83d\udd14\\n\\n### **Hyperliquid: Real-Time Notifications for DeFi Risk Management**\\n\\nIn the fast-paced world of decentralized finance, Hyperliquid users benefit from Push Protocol\'s real-time alerts, which enable proactive risk management. For traders on Hyperliquid, staying on top of liquidation risks and position updates is essential. Push provides instant notifications to users\' wallets, allowing them to manage risks, optimize trades, and act immediately when market conditions change.\\n\\nThis integration empowers DeFi users to make informed decisions in real-time, react quickly to price movements, and manage positions efficiently. It\'s a powerful tool for anyone trading in DeFi who wants to maximize their strategy and minimize risk.\\n\\nSubscribe to the [Hyperliquid Channel](https://app.push.org/channels/0xf1A1542Ca902AE861B59bffE77D92E8CD76146f1) \ud83d\udd14\\n\\n### **Uniswap: Liquidity Pool Monitoring**\\n\\nToday, Push is used by many leading decentralized exchanges to notify traders of changes in their positions, changes in prices, and other use cases. Uniswap utilizes its Push channel to\xa0 notify liquidity providers of significant changes in pool ratios, impermanent loss, or yield fluctuations. By keeping providers updated on the performance and risk of their assets, Push helps optimize liquidity management for decentralized exchanges. These real-time insights help liquidity providers make smarter decisions, manage risks better, and ultimately boost the liquidity and efficiency of decentralized markets.\\n\\nSubscribe to the [Uniswap V3 Channel](https://app.push.org/channels/0x97E5271f2987c7A3450e21dD7FFe4D004ddE773E) \ud83d\udd14\\n\\n### **Snapshot: Voting Alerts for DAOs**\\n\\nPush Protocol is an excellent addition to governance platforms like Snapshot. Through Snapshot\u2019s existing integration, DAOs and other on-chain communities can inform their community members about upcoming votes, results, and other governance actions. By using real-time notifications to ensure that users never miss an important vote or proposal update, Push is helping to encourage and increase active participation in DAO governance. Over time, [as noted in our initial announcement](https://push.org/blog/epns-partners-with-snapshot/), we expect the integration to be even further expanded to account for the needs of the frequently changing governance landscape.\\n\\nSubscribe to the [Snapshot Channel](https://app.push.org/channels/0x8C28Cf33d9Fd3D0293f963b1cd27e3FF422B425c) \ud83d\udd14\\n\\n### **Push for Gitcoin Grants?**\\n\\nPush does not currently have an integration with Gitcoin; however, Push Protocol could serve as a valuable tool for notifying contributors about campaign updates and new grant opportunities in the Gitcoin ecosystem. Contributors can opt-in to receive alerts for milestones, campaign deadlines, and updates on funded projects they support, keeping them engaged and informed about the causes they care about. In fact, every crypto ecosystem grants program can and will be able to benefit from such an integration.\\n\\n### **Looking Ahead: Real-Time Comms for All**\\n\\nWith its growing network of integrations, Push is poised to become the backbone of decentralized communication. Push Protocol\'s integrations with Lens Protocol, Hats Protocol, ENS Domains, Hyperliquid, and hundreds of other web3 projects are advancing decentralized user experiences across multiple areas. From social media and DeFi to DAO operations and digital identity, Push provides the essential infrastructure for real-time communication that keeps users engaged, informed, and in control. This will unlock more possibilities for users, giving them greater control and access to the real-time information that powers decentralized applications. As more protocols integrate Push\'s notification capabilities, the web3 space moves closer to delivering seamless, responsive, and user-centric experiences."},{"id":"how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-01-why-push-chat-is-diferent-from-other-traditional-platforms/index.md","title":"How Push Chat is Different from Traditional Chat Platforms ","description":"How Push Chat is Different from Traditional Chat Platforms?","date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 1, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Technical","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/technical"},{"label":"Push Tech","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-tech"}],"readingTime":4.743333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"SixtyKeys","title":"Guest Contributor","url":"https://x.com/sixty_keys","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorsixty.png","key":"sixty"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms","title":"How Push Chat is Different from Traditional Chat Platforms ","authors":["sixty"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"How Push Chat is Different from Traditional Chat Platforms?","text":"Learn about the key USPs that position Push Chat as the go-to messaging tool for Web3.","tags":["Technical","Push Tech"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Ecosystem Integrations: How Push Works with Other Protocols","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/how-push-works-with-other-protocols"},"nextItem":{"title":"What is Decentralized Social Media and Why Does it Matter?","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media"}},"content":"![Cover image of How Push Chat is Different from Traditional Chat Platforms](./cover-image.webp)\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAs the digital landscape shifts toward further decentralization, users\' expectations around privacy, control, and engagement in their favorite chat platforms are evolving too.  [Push Chat](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/#:~:text=Push%20Chat%20is%20a%20web3,numbers%2C%20email%20addresses%2C%20etc.), the communication protocol of Web3 reimagines digital messaging by incorporating new technologies, improved UX, and user-first functionalities that traditional platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal lack.\\n\\nIn this article, we dig deeper into what sets Push Chat apart.\\n\\n### Privacy+Anonymity: No Phone Number or Email Required\\n\\nTraditional chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram require a phone number or email to register, tying users to a specific identity, which can expose them to data tracking, phishing, or unwanted contacts. Push Chat bypasses this entirely. Users only need a [compatible EVM wallet](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/supported-wallet-standards/) to connect, meaning they can remain anonymous and communicate securely without compromising their identity while keeping personal data decentralized and user-controlled. \\n\\nUnlike centralized platforms that store personal information on servers, Push Chat\u2019s decentralized model gives users complete control over their data, removing the risk of centralized data leaks or misuse. \\n\\nThis approach aligns with the principles of decentralization, where privacy and ownership of data are prioritized, giving users a significant advantage over conventional platforms.\\n\\n\\n### Spam Prevention with Opt-In Chats\\n\\nSpam and unwanted messages are a common issue in traditional platforms. Push Chat employs a unique approach: it requires users to accept a request to chat before any conversation begins. This built-in spam filter means users won\u2019t receive unsolicited messages unless they\u2019ve approved the contact, making for a more streamlined and distraction-free experience.\\n\\nTraditional platforms often struggle with managing unsolicited contacts, relying heavily on manual blocking or report mechanisms, whereas Push Chat\u2019s solution is proactive and user-friendly.\\n\\n### Public Key Cryptography(PKC) for Message Encryption\\n\\nPrivacy-conscious users will appreciate that Push Chat ensures end-to-end encryption for all of its users. Although some traditional platforms like WhatsApp also provide this feature, Push Chat takes it a step further by using cryptography to ensure that messages remain private and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.\\n\\nWhen a user registers with Push Chat using their wallet, a public-private key pair is generated for them. The private key remains stored in the user\u2019s wallet, while the public key is available for others to encrypt messages intended for that user. When User A sends a message to User B, Push Chat uses User B\u2019s public key to encrypt the message. This ensures that only someone with the corresponding private key (User B) can decrypt and read it.\\n\\nThis encryption is achieved through asymmetric cryptography, a standard cryptographic technique where public keys are used to encrypt data and private keys to decrypt it. This setup makes it difficult for third parties to intercept messages, ensuring only the sender and recipient can read their conversations.\\n\\nIn summary, [Push Chat\u2019s end-to-end encryption](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/concepts/encryption-version-in-push-chat/#:~:text=Encryption%20in%20Push%20Chat,or%20decrypt%20your%20PGP%20keys) leverages advanced cryptographic standards, entirely decentralized public-key management, and blockchain-based verification to ensure messages remain private, authenticated, and secure across the network.\\n\\n### Enhanced Interactivity with Farcaster Frames Support\\n\\nPush Chat has [integrated Farcaster Frames](https://gov.push.org/t/bringing-frames-interactive-mini-apps-to-push-network/1659). Frames enable developers and other projects to build a mini-web app, which, once shared in a Push Chat, will be embedded as an interactive, rich mini-app that anyone can interact with from within the chat. With this implementation of Frames, developers have the flexibility to do a variety of things, including but not limited to:\\n\\n- **On-Chain Interactions**: Users can perform actions like staking tokens, voting on governance proposals, or claiming rewards, all directly within Push Chat, enhancing ease and accessibility.\\n- **Gamification and Utilities**: Frames can facilitate engaging features, such as community games, NFT rarity checkers, or DAO-specific utilities, all tailored to user contexts for added functionality and fun.\\n- **Integrated Product Use**: Projects can leverage Frames to provide direct access to services like swapping tokens, accessing DeFi tools, or exploring digital collectibles, without users needing to leave the Push Chat environment.\\n- Letting users interact with their contracts, such as performing actions on-chain in any of the supported chains in Push Dapp.\\n- Allowing Frames developers to build gamified, rich apps with user contexts, enabling powerful utilities and actions.\\n- Letting users directly use their products without having to leave the Push Chat client.\\n\\nThis is a significant leap from the static nature of most traditional chats, where content is limited to media and text. With Farcaster Frames, Push Chat allows users to embed interactive experiences, making discussions more vibrant and personalized.\\n\\n### **Enhanced Security Through Decentralized Infrastructure**\\n\\nPush Chat\u2019s architecture is fundamentally decentralized, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy. Messages are stored on IPFS, ensuring that data remains accessible yet tamper-proof, without relying on any central server. Traditional messaging platforms often store data on centralized servers, which act as single points of failure and make data more vulnerable to breaches. In contrast, Push Chat\u2019s decentralized infrastructure minimizes these risks, ensuring that data remains secure and user-controlled. Additionally, all messages are validated by decentralized nodes in the Push Network, which verify sender authenticity and ensure the message integrity that centralized platforms can\u2019t match. This decentralized setup gives users control over their data, with each message transaction backed by blockchain-grade security.\\n\\n### **Its Ecosystem Integration Potential**\\n\\nPush Chat is designed with [seamless Web3-based integration](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/ui-components/) in mind, allowing it to be embedded directly within dApps across various ecosystems, from DeFi and DAOs to NFT platforms through its SDK. This flexibility means that users can access messaging features directly from within their favorite Web3 applications, enhancing usability by keeping interactions within a single interface. Whether coordinating within a DAO, interacting with DeFi protocols, or engaging in NFT communities, Push Chat\u2019s integration potential ensures it can become a core component of any Web3 platform, streamlining communication without disrupting the user experience.\\n\\n### **Hyperscalable Group Chats**\\n\\nGroup chat limitations are a common gripe with platforms like WhatsApp, which caps group sizes at 1024 members. Push Chat, however, is designed to be hyper-scalable, supporting group chats with up to 100,000 members. This scalability makes Push Chat ideal for communities, DAOs, and large organizations seeking decentralized solutions for communication. Whether for coordinating a global project or rallying a large community, Push Chat\u2019s infrastructure can accommodate diverse, large-scale interactions that traditional platforms simply can\u2019t match.\xa0 This scalability is ideal for DAOs conducting large-scale governance discussions, NFT holders participating in exclusive, massive events, or DeFi communities coordinating protocol updates. Push Chat\u2019s infrastructure allows Web3 communities of any size to communicate seamlessly, even as they grow, without the limitations of traditional chat platforms.\\n\\n### **Secure, Instant, Verifiable Payments (Coming Soon)**\\n\\nAs part of its roadmap, Push Chat is on its way to integrating secure, instant, and verifiable payments, allowing users to transact seamlessly within a chat. This feature holds substantial promise, especially in a world where peer-to-peer payments are increasingly popular. While traditional platforms like WeChat offer payments, they rely on centralized processing and limited compatibility with crypto. Push Chat\u2019s future payment functionality will support seamless Web3 payments, giving users a decentralized option for transferring value in real-time.\\n\\nFor example, DAOs could facilitate membership dues or tipping for community contributors directly within the chat, transforming Push Chat into both a communication and transaction hub. Creators, too, could receive direct support through seamless peer-to-peer payments, making Push Chat a versatile tool for engagement and value exchange within Web3 communities.\\n\\n### **Push Chat as a Public, Open-Source Utility**\\n\\nPush Chat\u2019s open-source nature and public infrastructure invite developers to seamlessly integrate secure, on-chain communication into their dApps. By providing unrestricted access to its APIs and SDKs, Push Chat allows any builder to expand its features, empowering a diverse range of Web3 projects\u2014be it governance tools, social apps, or gaming communities. The platform\u2019s decentralized nodes ensure data security and user autonomy, while its modular design makes it easy to combine with other protocols, serving as a foundational \u201cLego block\u201d in Web3\u2019s evolving tech stack. This community-centric approach fosters continuous improvement, creating a resilient, flexible communication layer that grows with the ecosystem.\\n\\n### **Push Chat: The Next Frontier for Communication**\\n\\nPush Chat redefines communication by merging decentralized principles with innovative features that cater to privacy, scalability, and community-driven interactions. Its unique Web3-native approach\u2014prioritizing anonymous access, interactivity, and robust community support\u2014sets it apart from traditional platforms. In a world where user needs are expanding beyond basic messaging, Push Chat not only meets those needs but anticipates and exceeds them, delivering a next-generation communication experience.

Centralized platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have, to date, dominated the landscape. However, they come with significant drawbacks: they control user data, moderate content arbitrarily, and are driven by algorithms that prioritize selective monetization over genuine interaction.\\n\\nDecentralized social media marks a pivotal shift in how we engage in our favorite spaces online. It\'s not just a fleeting trend\u2014it\'s a movement poised to redefine online interactions, ownership, and privacy. By offering an alternative to the status quo, decentralized social media empowers users with unprecedented control over their data, social connections, and digital identities. This article will explore what decentralized social media is, its significance, and how innovative platforms such as Farcaster, Lens Protocol, Cyber, and Push Protocol are spearheading this transformation.\\n\\n## **Verifiable Data Ownership and Better Privacy**\\n\\nA crucial difference between centralized and decentralized social media is their approach to data ownership. On traditional platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or X (formerly Twitter), users relinquish control of their data from the moment they sign up. Every post, comment, like, and share is stored on company-owned servers and used to serve ads or fine-tune engagement algorithms. Users have little to no say in how their data is used, sold, or manipulated.\\n\\nAt its core, decentralized social media empowers users by giving them back control over their data. By utilizing blockchain technology, decentralized social platforms ensure that users retain control over their personal information and interactions. No single entity has the power to censor, delete, or exploit this data without the user\'s consent. This shift from platform-owned to user-owned data is a crucial step toward building a more open, transparent, and privacy-respecting social media landscape. This shift is already underway, as evidenced by the examples we\'ll explore below. \\n\\n## **Composable & Decentralized Social Graphs: Lens Protocol**\\n\\nA key innovation of decentralized social media is the concept of composable social graphs. On traditional platforms, a user\'s social graph (their collection of connections, followers, and interactions) is locked away by the provider. If said user wants to switch to a new platform, they lose access to all of the relationships they\u2019ve built and the content they may have curated or created. On decentralized platforms, your social graph\u2014your relationships, posts, and interactions\u2014can be seamlessly transferred across any app supporting the same protocol.\\n\\nLens Protocol is a prime example of how decentralized social media can empower users to take full ownership of their online identity and social graph. Built on Polygon, Lens offers users composable profiles that can interact with a variety of social dApps supported by its foundational network. No matter what dApp they use to choose, Lens users truly own their social graph as an NFT. This means that it is always possible to move between different dApps (decentralized applications) without having to rebuild their audience or connections. This level of portability is made possible through blockchain technology, fostering a more interoperable and user-friendly decentralized social ecosystem. \\n\\n## **Dynamic Social Engagement: Farcaster Frames**\\n\\nFarcaster via its primary client, Warpcast, illustrates how decentralized social media can be more engaging and empowering for users. They not only allow users to own their social graph and content but also introduce a novel feature called \\"Frames,\u201d which we\u2019re integrating [into the Push Protocol ecosystem](https://gov.push.org/t/bringing-frames-interactive-mini-apps-to-push-network/1659).\\n\\nFrames are interactive, modular spaces within posts (known as \\"Casts\\" on Farcaster via Warpcast) where users can embed dynamic content such as polls, live updates, or even full-scale applications.\\n\\nThe launch of Frames has already enabled entirely new forms of interaction and engagement that go beyond what was possible before. Web-based content goes from its current, fairly static state to the equivalent of an application in and of itself. What about literal instant check-out for orders? Imagine being able to vote on a DAO proposal, stream a podcast, trade crypto or NFTs, and subscribe to a creator or channel\u2014all within the same post. That\u2019s a kind of composability that centralized platforms simply can\u2019t match. By allowing users to organize and showcase the content they find most meaningful, Frames create a more personalized and context-driven experience. Though it\u2019s early, Frames are already a key cog in the machine that represents the future of all social media. \\n\\n## **An Improved, Streamlined User Experience: Cyber**\\n\\nCyber, a Layer 2 solution built on Optimism\'s Superchain and hyper-optimized for web3 social interactions aims to a user experience on par with apps that are already household names on the legacy web. It achieves this by addressing key usability challenges and boosting the scalability and performance of decentralized platforms. \\n\\nTraditional blockchain platforms can also be clunky for users unfamiliar with managing private keys, wallets, and on-chain transactions. Cyber addresses this by incorporating built-in account abstraction and seedless wallets, delivering a frictionless user experience. Account abstraction simplifies wallet management by abstracting the complexities of managing multiple accounts and private keys away from the user. Seedless wallets, on the other hand, eliminate the need for cumbersome recovery phrases. Together, these features allow users to interact with decentralized apps and platforms as easily as they would with centralized services\u2014without compromising security or ownership. \\n\\nAs social interactions become more complex and require faster processing times, Layer 2 solutions like Cyber will become increasingly important for both developers and users. \\n\\n## **Decentralized Cross-Chain Communication: Push**\\n\\nPlatforms like **Push Protocol**, with its **Push Chat** feature, add a layer of utility by offering decentralized messaging systems. Unlike traditional messaging platforms, Push Chat enables encrypted, peer-to-peer communication, where users retain complete control over their conversations. The integration of notifications is another major win\u2014decentralized push notifications ensure users stay updated on critical events, such as governance proposals, NFT drops, or community votes, all without relying on centralized servers.\\n\\nSoon to be [cross-chain](https://www.notion.so/Abstracting-away-Chains-for-a-better-UX-5fc5796918aa47ed8619a72d3bd01af9?pvs=21), Push Chat will allow users to communicate across multiple blockchain networks, making it a powerful tool for decentralized communication and breaking down the silos between separate ecosystems. By enabling cross-chain communication, Push Chat opens up seamless interaction for users in decentralized communities, governance, and beyond.\\n\\nWhether it\'s notifying users of governance proposals, sending updates on decentralized projects, [facilitating hyper-scalable group chats](https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats/), or supporting the future of comms, social, gaming, and generally innovative apps through its grants program, Push is setting a new standard for decentralized communication tools and applications.\\n\\nAs Push Chat and Push Protocol itself continue to evolve, they will become even more important for decentralized social networks, since together, they allow users to communicate seamlessly across different dApps and ecosystems.\xa0 Cross-chain functionality is a game-changer for both social interaction and decentralized governance, as it breaks down the barriers between blockchain networks. Push\u2019s commitment to [enabling Cross-Chain Requests](https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/) demonstrates the team\u2019s commitment to being a forerunner in that respect.\\n\\n## **The Future of Social Media is Coming**\\n\\nDecentralized social media offers a transformative approach to how we interact online, empowering users with ownership of their data, social graphs, and communication channels. Ultimately, decentralized social media is about more than just freedom from centralized control\u2014it\u2019s about creating a fairer, more user-centric web. By embracing decentralized platforms, we can take back control of our online identities and interactions. We will also be able to explore new models of engagement that are transparent, innovative, and built for the benefit of the user, not the platform.\\n\\nThis shift is not just inevitable; it\u2019s necessary.\\n\\nAs we become more aware of the limitations and risks of centralized social networks, the move toward decentralized alternatives will accelerate. More users, developers, and creators will flock to platforms like **Farcaster**, **Lens**, **Cyber**, and **Push Protocol**. We\u2019ll begin to see a new era of online interaction\u2014one that puts users at the center of everything and further connects our nascent industry, building a better, more equitable internet for all.\\n\\nAll of the frameworks, networks, and projects mentioned here are key partners of Push Protocol and its DAO. Inside Push DAO, we believe that together with these groups and all of Push\u2019s partners, we\u2019ll build a truly impactful future for online communication and the internet at large.\\n\\nTogether, we\'ll make web3 the prevailing reality. \\n\\n[Reach out to the DAO](https://gov.push.org/) and we\u2019ll get you plugged in with the ecosystem\u2019s grants program, which is now undergoing an exciting evolution in preparation for 2025. We only succeed in building forward towards a fairer, decentralized web, as one."},{"id":"why-onchain-push-notifications-matter","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/why-onchain-push-notifications-matter","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-18-why-do-onchain-push-notifications-matter/index.md","title":"Why Do On-Chain Push Notifications Matter?","description":"Why Do On-Chain Push Notifications Matter?","date":"2024-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 18, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Products","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/products"}],"readingTime":3.566666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"},{"name":"SixtyKeys","title":"Guest Contributor","url":"https://x.com/sixty_keys","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorsixty.png","key":"sixty"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"why-onchain-push-notifications-matter","title":"Why Do On-Chain Push Notifications Matter?","authors":["push","sixty"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Why Do On-Chain Push Notifications Matter?","text":"Discover why on-chain push notifications are a necessity for improving your daily on-chain experience.","tags":["Products"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"What is Decentralized Social Media and Why Does it Matter?","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media"},"nextItem":{"title":"Abstracting Away Chains For a Better DApp UX","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux"}},"content":"![Cover image of Why Do On-Chain Push Notifications Matter](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIn the fast-moving Web3 space, new developments and breakthroughs emerge at breakneck speeds, so staying informed and ahead of the curve is essential. However, most decentralized applications (dApps) lack native notification systems, leaving users in the dark when critical on-chain events occur. This is where push notifications, an on-chain communications primitive developed by Push Protocol, become crucial.\\n\\n## **dApps Lack Native Notifications**\\n\\nMost Web3 applications operate in a decentralized manner. They often don\'t include native push notifications like their Web2 counterparts (aka notifications you would receive from apps like WhatsApp or X). In the case of traditional apps, push notifications keep users updated on essential activities\u2014whether it\'s a message from a friend or a reminder to pay bills. dApps, by contrast, typically require users to manually check their wallets or dashboards for updates, creating a less-than-user-friendly experience.\\n\\nWithout notifications, users can easily miss key events like:\\n\\n- **Price movements of their favorite assets**\\n- **Governance proposal updates in DAOs**\\n- **Liquidation alerts in DeFi platforms**\\n- **The latest publications from their chosen web3 news platform**\\n\\nThis gap is more than a mere inconvenience; it affects user engagement, asset security, and decision-making.\\n\\n## **So Why Do On-Chain Push Notifications Matter?**\\n\\nLet\'s break it down below:\\n\\n### **1. Real-Time Awareness for Time-Sensitive Actions**\\n\\nOn-chain push notifications ensure users never miss important events that require immediate attention. Whether it\'s an impending liquidation in a DeFi protocol or a time-sensitive governance vote in a DAO, notifications can help users act quickly.\\n\\n### **2. Improving UX in Decentralized Applications**\\n\\nPush notifications are an integral part of modern user experience (UX) design. By integrating on-chain notifications, dApps can bring a more familiar and seamless experience to users. This can reduce the friction typically associated with interacting with decentralized applications.\\n\\n### **3. Push is Everywhere, For Every Use Case**\\n\\nPush Protocol\u2019s notifications are **multi-platform**, meaning users can receive alerts in their wallets, on their smartphones, and inside of other dApps. To date, Push Protocol has deployments on Android, iOS, and wallets like MetaMask and Unstoppable Domains.

Essentially, it acts as an intermediary layer that simplifies cross-chain interactions, enabling seamless communication and functionality across diverse blockchain ecosystems.\\n\\nThe fundamental idea behind Chain Abstraction is to create a unified user experience that abstracts away the differences between various blockchain protocols. \\n\\nThis means that users can perform actions on a dApp without having to switch networks, manage multiple wallets, or understand the technical nuances of each blockchain. By streamlining these interactions, Chain Abstraction aims to make Web3 more accessible and user-friendly, fostering broader adoption and sustained engagement.\\n\\n## Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction\\n\\n\\n### Simplified User Interactions\\n\\nOne of the primary benefits of Chain Abstraction is the simplification of user interactions with dApps. Currently, users often need to switch between different blockchain networks to access various functionalities, which can be cumbersome and deter non-technical users. \\n\\nHere is a quick glance at what the typical web3 user needs to deal with today in this multi-chain web3 ecosystem:\\n\\n- *managing multiple wallets,*\\n- *managing multiple native tokens/assets in their multiple wallets,*\\n- *understanding the nuances of each network,*\\n- *navigating multiple networks to perform simple tasks,*\\n- *interacting with complicated dApp UIs with frequent network switching,*\\n- *navigate through inconsistent user interfaces,*\\n- *relying on the risky route of cross-chain bridging between chains,*\\n- *experiencing difficulty in maintaining a consistent cross-chain identity due to the multi-chain ecosystem,*\\n- *dealing with the lack of standardization between networks, protocols, etc.*\\n- *dealing with the learning curve of understanding different networks, each with its own set of rules, interfaces, and requirements.*\\n\\nRemember that this is just a glance at the UX problem. There are undoubtedly more issues that an experienced web3 user faces daily. The list is even longer when it comes to newbie web3 users.\\n\\nHowever, with Chain Abstraction, most of it gets abstracted away. \\n\\nIn other words, chain abstraction shall allow users to only perform the bare minimum actions and delegate all others to specialized on-chain or off-chain actors. These actors can simply take the user\u2019s intent and themselves figure out the best route, chain, transaction order, etc to fulfill the user\u2019s request.\\n\\nThis means that the user can have a significantly simplified on-chain interaction where most of the multi-chain-specific complicated tasks will be abstracted away from them, thus improving the overall UX for an average Joe.\\n\\n### Unified Wallet Management\\n\\nManaging multiple wallets across different chains is another pain point for users. \\n\\nChain Abstraction addresses this by enabling a single wallet interface that can interact with multiple blockchains. This reduces the cognitive load on users, allowing them to manage their digital assets more efficiently as well as more securely from a single platform.\\n\\n### Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions\\n\\nChain Abstraction facilitates seamless cross-chain transactions, eliminating the need for manual bridging or swapping of assets. This not only enhances the speed and efficiency of transactions but also reduces the risk of errors and the potential security vulnerabilities associated with manual bridging processes.\\n\\n### Enhanced Performance and Scalability\\n\\nChain Abstraction can also contribute to improved performance and scalability of dApps. By leveraging the strengths of multiple blockchains, dApps can optimize transaction speeds and reduce congestion on any single network. \\n\\nThis distributed approach ensures that dApps remain responsive and efficient, even as user demand grows.\\n\\n### Security and Reliability\\n\\nWhile traditional interop or bridging solutions often introduce multiple points of vulnerability. For instance, the reliance on centralized validators or relayers can lead to potential breaches if these entities are compromised. Additionally, bridges typically depend on complex smart contracts and multi-signature schemes, which, if not meticulously audited, become prime targets for attackers. Historical incidents have underscored these risks, with a substantial portion of stolen crypto funds originating from bridge exploits. Most of the [massive crypto hacks](https://medium.com/immunefi/common-cross-chain-bridge-vulnerabilities-d8c161ffaf8f) in the past have occurred through compromised bridges, highlighting the critical need for more secure cross-chain solutions.\\n\\nIn contrast, Chain Abstraction minimizes these risks by shrinking down the attack surface area to a greater extent as it reduces direct user interactions with various chains. Instead of users navigating multiple networks and managing separate security protocols, Chain Abstraction delegates these responsibilities to specialized on-chain actors, such as intent handlers or solvers.\\n\\nThis delegation not only streamlines the user experience but also centralizes security oversight, allowing for more effective and consistent application of security measures. By handling transactions through a unified interface, Chain Abstraction can implement robust security protocols that ensure transactions are validated and processed securely across all supported chains.\\n\\nHowever, it\'s important to recognize that Chain Abstraction introduces new points of security consideration. The addition of abstraction layers and off-chain components, like handlers or solvers, necessitates a reevaluation of the security framework. While these layers reduce the attack surface by limiting direct interactions with multiple chains, they also require their own stringent security measures. Ensuring the integrity and security of these new components is crucial, as any vulnerabilities within the abstraction layer could potentially compromise the entire system.\\n\\n## The Importance of Chain Abstraction for Web3\'s Vision\\n\\n\\nNow that we understand what Chain Abstraction is, let\u2019s quickly go over a few imperative points to understand why it matters.\\n\\n### Streamlining User Onboarding\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges facing Web3 is the complexity of onboarding new users. \\n\\nChain Abstraction plays a crucial role in addressing this by providing a seamless entry point into the decentralized ecosystem. \\n\\nNew users can interact with dApps without needing to navigate the complexities of different blockchain networks, making the transition from Web2 to Web3 smoother and more intuitive.\\n\\n### Enhancing User Retention\\n\\nA simplified and consistent user experience is key to retaining users in the long term. \\n\\nChain Abstraction ensures that users can effortlessly engage with dApps across various chains, reducing friction and enhancing satisfaction. \\n\\nThis leads to higher retention rates as users are more likely to continue using platforms that offer a seamless and hassle-free experience.\\n\\n### Enabling a Diverse Range of Applications\\n\\nChain Abstraction opens the door to a broader spectrum of applications by enabling interoperability between different blockchains. \\n\\nDevelopers can build innovative dApps that leverage the unique features of multiple chains without being limited by the constraints of a single network. \\n\\nThis fosters a more vibrant and diverse ecosystem, encouraging creativity and innovation in application development.\\n\\n### Facilitating Cross-Chain Collaboration\\n\\nIn a multi-chain world, collaboration between different blockchain projects becomes essential. Chain Abstraction facilitates this by providing the necessary infrastructure for cross-chain communication and interoperability. \\n\\nThis collaborative environment enables projects to share resources, data, and functionalities, driving collective growth and advancement in the Web3 space.\\n\\n### Reducing Fragmentation\\n\\nThe decentralized nature of Web3 often leads to fragmentation, with various blockchains operating in silos. \\n\\nChain Abstraction mitigates this by creating a cohesive ecosystem where different chains can interact seamlessly. This reduces fragmentation, promotes unity, and ensures that the benefits of decentralization are harnessed collectively rather than being diluted across disparate networks.\\n\\n### Accelerating Mainstream Adoption\\n\\nFor Web3 to achieve mainstream adoption, it must offer a user experience that rivals traditional Web2 applications. \\n\\nChain Abstraction is instrumental in bridging this gap by providing a seamless, intuitive, and efficient user experience that meets the expectations of mainstream users. \\n\\nBy removing technical barriers and enhancing usability, Chain Abstraction paves the way for Web3 to become a ubiquitous part of everyday life.\\n\\n## CCR: Push Protocol\u2019s Crucial Move towards Enhancing UX\\n\\n\\nAt Push Protocol, we have consistently focused on enhancing the user experience, not only for Push\u2019s own community but also for the entire Web3 ecosystem.\\n\\nSince the launch of our dApp, we have prioritized a [UX-driven](https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/) and security-first strategy. \\n\\nWhether we\u2019re refining the visual interface, optimizing our smart contracts, or implementing gasless opt-ins for seamless dApp interactions, we remain dedicated to these principles across all facets of our platform.\\n\\nHowever, improving UX in web3 involves far more than just building intuitive user interfaces for our applications. \\n\\nIn a multi-chain ecosystem, users have to deal with a lot more complexities, as previously mentioned in this article.\\n\\nSince Push Protocol supports more than one EVM chain (*and soon will support non-evm chains),* our dApp\u2019s UX needs to be improved accordingly.\\n\\nThere is a need for us to ensure we abstract away all the multi-chain complexity for our users and provide a single unified interface for them to use.\\n\\nAnd, we do this with the [**Cross Chain Request Feature.**](https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794) \\n\\n### What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?\\n\\n**Cross Chain Requests (CCR)** is a feature recently proposed in [Push Protocol\u2019s Pre-PIP 3 governance proposal](https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794). It aims to implement Cross Chain Requests within Push Protocol\u2019s smart contracts, namely PushCore and PushComm. \\n\\nThe CCR feature allows users to interact with the PushCore smart contract deployed on the Ethereum chain from any EVM or Non-EVM chain without the need to switch networks. Thus, providing an abstracted experience.\\n\\n### How CCR Enhances dApp UX\\n\\n**Seamless Network Interactions**\\n\\nWith CCR, users can perform essential actions such as [channel creation](https://app.push.org/channel/create), incentivized chat requests, and other arbitrary requests directly from their preferred blockchain. This eliminates the need to switch to Ethereum to interact with PushCore, thereby streamlining the user experience and reducing friction.\\n\\n**Multi-Chain Compatibility**\\n\\nCCR shall leverage [Wormhole\u2019s Native Token Transfer (NTT) architecture](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers) and Relayers to enable secure cross-chain message and token bridging. \\n\\nThis allows PushComm contracts deployed on various chains to relay requests to PushCore on Ethereum securely. \\n\\nUsers can initiate actions from their native chains, enhancing the flexibility and convenience of interacting with Push Protocol.\\n\\nBy enabling seamless interactions from any chain, Push Protocol can attract users from various blockchain ecosystems. This broadens the platform\u2019s user base, fostering a more interconnected and diverse community that benefits from enhanced interoperability.\\n\\n**Simplified Channel Creation**\\n\\nFor instance, a user like Bob, who operates on Polygon, can create a channel on PushCore without leaving Polygon. By using PushComm\u2019s *createChannel()* function, Bob can submit channel details and approve necessary tokens directly from Polygon. CCR ensures that the request is securely relayed to PushCore on Ethereum, where the channel is created without Bob needing to navigate complex cross-chain processes.\\n\\n### Technical Improvements Through CCR\\n\\n### Unified Contract Interactions\\n\\nCCR centralizes the interaction logic within PushComm contracts deployed on multiple chains, enabling them to handle cross-chain requests effectively. This reduces the architectural complexity and ensures that PushCore remains secure and efficient without needing multiple deployments across different chains.\\n\\n### Enhanced Security\\n\\nBy utilizing Wormhole\u2019s NTT framework and Relayers, CCR ensures that cross-chain messages and token transfers are conducted securely. \\n\\nThis minimizes the risk of vulnerabilities and enhances the overall reliability of cross-chain interactions, fostering greater user trust in Push Protocol\u2019s solutions.\\n\\n### Scalability and Efficiency\\n\\nCCR allows Push Protocol to scale its operations across multiple chains without being limited by the constraints of a single blockchain. \\n\\nThis scalability ensures that Push Protocol can accommodate a growing user base and diverse application needs, driving sustained growth and adoption.\\n\\n## Chain Abstraction: Where We\'re Headed\\n\\n\\n**Chain Abstraction** stands as a transformative force in the Web3 ecosystem, promising to elevate dApp UX to unprecedented levels of seamlessness and accessibility. \\n\\nChain Abstraction is not just a technical enhancement. It\u2019s also a fundamental shift toward making decentralized applications more user-friendly and widely accessible. By abstracting away the complexities of multiple chains, Chain Abstraction empowers users and developers alike, fostering a more robust and inclusive Web3 ecosystem. Push Protocol, through its CCR feature, is at the forefront of this movement, championing a future where dApp interactions are as seamless and intuitive as those in the traditional web2 world.\\n\\nAs the Web3 landscape continues to evolve, the importance of Chain Abstraction will only grow. By focusing on user experience and interoperability, Chain Abstraction can drive the next wave of innovation and adoption in decentralized applications. [Push Protocol\u2019s CCR feature](https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/) is a testament to this potential, demonstrating how thoughtful design and strategic implementation can create a more accessible and engaging Web3 environment."},{"id":"monthly-recap-september-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/monthly-recap-september-2024","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-16-monthly-updates-september/index.md","title":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates - September","description":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates - September","date":"2024-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 16, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Updates","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/updates"},{"label":"Announcements","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/announcements"},{"label":"Community & Ecosystem","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/community-ecosystem"}],"readingTime":4.173333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"monthly-recap-september-2024","title":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates - September","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates - September","text":"Discover Push\'s incredible September growth, including over 9 million notifications sent and other key milestones!","tags":["Updates","Announcements","Community & Ecosystem"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Abstracting Away Chains For a Better DApp UX","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux"},"nextItem":{"title":"Token-Gated Group Chats","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/token-gated-group-chats"}},"content":"![Cover image of Case Study - Moving across an open web with Push](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSeptember was a milestone month for Push Protocol, with remarkable strides across development, integrations, UI enhancements, DAO initiatives, and broader community growth.

To put it even more simply, users must hold a certain token or NFT in their wallet to be granted entry to these exclusive group chats. This concept leverages the power of the different [ERC token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/) standard technologies, offering decentralized and permissionless access control to on-chain communities.\\n\\nThese gated communities are becoming an increasingly popular option across all sorts of web3 groups, including DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), NFT collector groups, and on-chain role holders. By tokenizing access, these chats provide a powerful tool for enhancing privacy, fostering trust, and building a strong sense of belonging.\\n\\n### **How Do Token-Gated Group Chats Work?**\\n\\nFirst, token-gated chats depend on the accurate verification of the assets in a user\u2019s blockchain wallet. In the case of Push\u2019s gated chats, Push Protocol authenticates a user\'s wallet holdings to ensure they possess the required token or NFT to join the chat. The authentication is automatic, eliminating the need for traditional usernames, passwords, or email sign-ups. This process is seamless, privacy-focused, and ensures that only eligible users gain access to the chat or chats involved.\\n\\nAll of it is done in a matter of minutes.\\n\\nOnce authenticated, users can join discussions, receive exclusive content, participate in community governance, and more\u2014making these group chats integral to any on-chain community.\\n\\n### **Why Do We Need Token-Gated Group Chats?**\\n\\nThe need for token-gated group chats stems from the growing demand for decentralized, transparent, and secure community management tools and workstreams in the web3 space.\\n\\nBelow, we\u2019ve compiled several examples of current and future use cases:\\n\\n**1. Exclusive Access for DAOs:**\\n\\nFor DAOs, token-gated group chats offer a mechanism to ensure that only voting members or contributors with skin in the game can participate in decision-making discussions. By using governance tokens as the entry key, DAOs can securely manage spaces where they want only a certain threshold of token holders to participate and share opinions.\\n\\n- **Benefits**: Having tokenized group chata strengthens governance processes by ensuring that only active, vested members are involved in the DAO\'s core operations, reducing noise and improving engagement quality.\\n- **Use Case**: DAOs like MakerDAO or Uniswap could create token-gated group chats for core governance contributors or voting members, creating secure spaces for key discussions.\\n\\n**2. Community Building for NFT Collectors:**\\n\\nNFT projects are built on the idea of exclusive ownership, and token-gated chats are a natural extension of this exclusivity. By allowing only verified NFT holders into private chat rooms, project creators can cultivate tight-knit communities that feel valued, special, and more closely connected to artists, founders, or whoever else the holders bought the NFT to support.\\n\\n- **Benefits**: NFT owners get a space where they can engage directly with creators and fellow collectors, access exclusive content, and receive early updates or airdrops.\\n- **Use Case**: A popular NFT collection like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) might use a token-gated chat to offer holders access to exclusive discussions about future projects, merchandise drops, or events.\\n\\n**3. Enhanced Security and Privacy:**\\n\\nToken-gated group chats inherently provide a higher level of privacy and security compared to traditional centralized platforms. By using cryptographic wallets as authentication, users no longer need to rely on third-party platforms that store personal data. This aligns with the ethos of decentralization and significantly reduces the risks of hacking or data breaches.\\n\\n- **Benefits**: No usernames or passwords or any storage of any sort of personal documents is required and there is no risk of sensitive personal information being leaked.\\n- **Use Case**: Communities concerned with privacy, like those focused on anonymous or pseudonymous interactions, can use token-gated chats to ensure secure and private communication.\\n\\n**4. Direct Monetization of Communities:**\\n\\nFor content creators and influencers, token-gated chats provide a unique opportunity to monetize access to their communities. By selling tokens or NFTs that grant access to their private group chats, they can create an additional revenue stream while giving fans and followers a sense of exclusivity.\\n\\n- **Benefits**: Fans get special access to behind-the-scenes content, exclusive Q&As, or direct interactions with their favorite creators, while creators benefit from new revenue models.\\n- **Use Case**: A crypto influencer might create a token-gated chat for subscribers who hold a specific NFT, offering them VIP content and advice.\\n\\n### **How Hats Protocol Enhances Token-Gated Group Chats**\\n\\nFor DAOs using **Hats Protocol**, the integration of token-gated group chats can significantly streamline their communication processes. Hats Protocol enables the decentralized management of roles and permissions within a DAO, allowing members to be assigned \\"hats\\" based on their roles. These hats can also serve as access tokens for group chats, ensuring that only members with the relevant responsibilities can participate in specific discussions.\\n\\nHere\u2019s how DAOs that use Hats Protocol can benefit from token-gated group chats:\\n\\n**1. Role-Based Chat Access:**\\n\\nHats Protocol allows DAOs to assign roles on-chain, ensuring that only those members who wear specific hats (such as \\"Treasury Manager\\" or \\"Governance Lead\\") have access to relevant group chats. This integration ensures that discussions stay focused and are only open to those with the proper permissions.\\n\\n- **Benefits**: Only relevant DAO members can join key discussions, preventing unqualified members from cluttering important communication channels.\\n\\n**2. Dynamic Access Control:**\\n\\nAs roles (or hats) within a DAO evolve, access to token-gated chats can dynamically adjust. When someone is promoted, or steps down from a role, their access to group chats is automatically updated, ensuring up-to-date permissions.\\n\\n- **Benefits**: Access to crucial communication channels remains in sync with the current organizational structure without manual updates.\\n\\n**3. Increased Security and Confidentiality:**\\n\\nDAOs can maintain security and confidentiality by ensuring that sensitive topics, such as treasury or governance discussions, are restricted to verified role-holders. Hats Protocol makes it easy to manage and track who holds each hat, ensuring secure communication.\\n\\n- **Benefits**: Only authorized members access sensitive information, reducing the likelihood of leaks or mismanagement.\\n\\n**4. Streamlined Team Coordination:**\\n\\nLarge DAOs can have multiple teams managing different parts of the organization. Hats Protocol ensures that team members with the relevant roles can communicate within private, token-gated group chats, enhancing collaboration across decentralized teams.\\n\\n- **Benefits**: Teams can focus on their responsibilities, while DAO leaders can rest assured that only the right people can access certain discussions.\\n\\n### **The Future of Token-Gated Group Chats**\\n\\nToken-gated chats are just one example of how Push Protocol is transforming the way we interact online. As the demand for decentralized governance, privacy, and exclusivity grows, token-gated communities will become a staple in the web3 ecosystem.\\n\\nFor DAOs, NFT collectors, on-chain role holders, and content creators alike, token-gated chats provide the tools needed to foster loyalty, increase engagement, and ensure that only the right people are involved in key discussions.\\n\\nToken-gated group chats are unlocking a future where participation is open and earned, making the web3 ecosystem more exclusive, secure, and rewarding.\\n\\n**Earn points for Gated Group Chats**\\n\\nWith the [Push Points Program](https://push.org/blog/introducing-the-push-points-program/) in full swing, we have added an extra incentive to new users looking to explore the Token Gated Groups.

This combination is designed to facilitate the development of advanced next-generation DApps. With it, decentralized applications should be easier, faster, and more scalable than ever before. \\n\\nCartesi overcomes the constraints of traditional blockchains by providing developers with a complete Linux operating system and scalable rollups, tailored for real-world applications. This opens up exciting new possibilities for DApps in gaming, DeFi, and other cutting-edge industries, unlocking the future of innovation.\\n\\nCartesi-built projects have consistently excelled in [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) hackathons with innovative projects like [Cartenix](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/cartenix-7xxe6), [Doom Arena](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/doom-arena-hmu4j), and [ChainGPT](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/chaingpt-and-accountability-for-ai-agents-doquk) gaining considerable traction. These projects not only showcase their commitment to decentralized computation but also highlight Cartesi\u2019s unique ability to unlock new possibilities for scalable, high-performance DApps across various real-world use cases. Other Cartesi Mainnet DApps like [Rives](https://rives.io/) and [Bug Buster](https://bugbuster.app/) also showed new unforeseen possibilities.\\n\\n### How Developers can Integrate Cartesi and Push Protocol:\\n\\nDeveloper advocacy contributors at Cartesi have demonstrated how developers can integrate push notifications into their Cartesi dApps, enabling users to receive updates related to their activities within the Cartesi rollups environment. Developers can deliver finalized on-chain messages or simple in-app notifications that users care about.\\n\\nThis integration enhances the interactivity of Cartesi DApps, so users can receive timely updates\u2014whether for verified outputs or simple messages\u2014without monitoring epoch finalization.\\n\\nThis is particularly useful when managing on-chain assets, where users need to execute a voucher once an epoch is finalized. Vouchers serve as transaction instruments on the base layer blockchain, facilitating operations like asset transfers. They enable modifications to the base layer by reflecting the application\'s state changes. Read [here](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/development/retrieve-outputs/#vouchers-on-chain-actions) to learn more about vouchers. With notifications powered by Push, Cartesi users can also stay informed about unexecuted vouchers, ensuring they don\'t miss critical updates, like withdrawing assets.\\n\\n### **Technical Deep Dive: The Cartesi Push Notification Server**\\n\\nThe [Cartesi Push Notification Server](https://github.com/Mugen-Builders/push-cartesi/) is a crucial tool that enhances the user experience of Cartesi DApps by providing real-time push notifications. This service is powered by a simple cron job that allows Cartesi DApp creators to notify users of important events, such as those mentioned above, verified outputs, or the availability of vouchers for asset withdrawal, without requiring users to monitor blockchain events like epoch finalization manually.\\n\\n**Addressing the On-Chain Asset Challenge:**\\nOne key challenge in decentralized applications involving on-chain assets is the need for users to execute a voucher after an epoch has been finalized. Without notifications, users may miss the execution of vouchers, potentially delaying their withdrawal of assets. The Cartesi Push Notification Server directly solves this problem by alerting users when important events\u2014such as unexecuted vouchers\u2014occur, ensuring they remain informed and can act promptly in response to them.\\n\\n**How It Works: Push Notifications for Cartesi DApps:**\\n\\nThe Push Cartesi Notification server operates through a cron job that regularly queries the Graphql server of the Cartesi dApp node to check for new or verified outputs. Here\u2019s how developers can implement it:\\n\\n1. **Push Notification Architecture:** \\nThe Push Cartesi Notification Server leverages a cron job that filters for [notices](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/development/retrieve-outputs/#notices-off-chain-events) and verified proofs, sending timely notifications to users about these critical outputs. However, vouchers are intentionally excluded from the cron job, as they are deleted after execution. Instead, the system focuses on notifying users when a proof is available\u2014triggering them to take action, such as executing a voucher.\\n\\nHere\u2019s the architecture of how the Push Cartesi Notification Server works:\\n\\n![Push Cartesi Notification Server](cover-image1.webp)\\n\\n2. **Creating a Push Notification Channel:**\\nTo start, developers must set up a Push notification channel using [Push Protocol\u2019s official guide](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/tutorials/create-your-channel/). The rest of the setup process is explained below. \\n\\n3. **Efficient Notification Management Using Notices:**\\nDevelopers can include a \\"notice\\" alongside vouchers to ensure users are properly informed about important, on-chain events. For example, when an NFT is minted, a notice can be generated to notify the user of this event, while the voucher handles the asset\u2019s actual minting process. A notice is a verifiable data statement that confirms off-chain events or conditions, supported by accompanying proof.\\n\\n4. **Two Types of Notifications: Instant vs. Proofed:**\\nDevelopers have control over when notifications are sent to users through two types of notices:\\n- Instant Notifications: These notifications are sent immediately after a notice is created, allowing users to get real-time updates.\\n- Proofed Notifications: These notifications are sent only when a proof is available, i.e., when the epoch finalizes, ensuring that users are alerted once the output is verified and actionable.\\n\\n5. **Streamlined Asset Withdrawals:**\\nThe Push/Cartesi notification system is particularly valuable in managing on-chain assets. When users need to withdraw assets, they are alerted when a voucher is ready for execution. By receiving these timely notifications, users can act quickly, avoiding delays or missed withdrawals.\\n\\n### Setting up Notifications for Cartesi DApps:\\n\\nDisclaimer: *This integration is currently in its alpha stage and relies on certain trust assumptions regarding the Notifications server. Developers are encouraged to use this as an experimental step for integrating push notifications but should not consider it a final, mainnet-ready solution.*\\n\\nFirst, make sure you have created a channel for Push. Once you\u2019ve done so, continue with the below steps to build and run the Notifications server with a sample Cartesi dApp on your local machine.:\\n\\n**Replace addresses in the code for the cron-job as follows:**\\n\\nInside notification.sender.js change the address to the address of your channel\\n\\n```\\npushChannelAdress = \\"0x41070EfeD9Ead91380AAE5e164DAC1001F64C991\\";\\n```\\n\\nInside graphql/config.js,  update the endpoint with the graphql route of your node.\\n\\n```\\nendpoint: \'http://localhost:8080/graphql\'\\n```\\n\\n**Add private key**\\n\\nDisclaimer: *This is just for test purposes. Do not try this with any real private key.*\\n\\nStart the process by creating a .env file from the given sample and filling it with the private key of the channel creator or delegated messenger. \\n\\n`cp .env.sample .env`\\n\\nNow you can start testing and launching the sending function for notifications!\\n\\n### Sending Notifications for Cartesi DApps:\\n\\nFrom inside your cron-job folder, use the following input:\\n\\n```\\nnpm start\\n```\\n\\nThen, you can start the simple-node DApp inside its directory with the below command:\\n\\n```\\ncartesi build\\n```\\n\\nTo fully initiate testing, follow the above up with the below:\\n\\n```\\ncartesi run\\n```\\n\\n**Send test inputs**\\n\\nOn another terminal window, type:\\n\\n```\\ncartesi send generic\\n```\\n\\nThen, send a string encoding as follows:\\n\\n```\\n{\u201ctype\u201d:\u201dinstant\u201d,\u201dmessage\u201d:\u201dsample message\u201d,\u201dtarget\u201d:\u201d*\u201d}\\n```\\n\\nThe field marked \u201ctype\u201d can be filled with one of two values either \u2018instant\u2019 or \u2018proof\u2019\\n\\nThe target field for the destination of the message can be a wallet address or * for broadcasts to everyone who subscribes to the channel.\\n\\nOnce you are ready to deploy you can generate a container with the Dockerfile inside the cron-job folder and deploy it to [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/launch/deploy/)\\n\\n[Here\u2019s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO-xhHT85Bk) a demo video showing the ins and outs of how Cartesi DApps can integrate Push Notifications using [Cartesi Push Notification Server](https://github.com/Mugen-Builders/push-cartesi/blob/main/README.md).\\n\\nThis integration is being tested out with [Comet](https://x.com/Comet_ing/status/1837041254166589535) - a Cartesi DApp.\\n\\nGot any questions?

Ethereum did the same for applications of all shapes and sizes. DeFi extended these principles, demonstrating a wide array of large-scale use cases for institutions and traders alike.\\n\\nNow, as an industry, we\u2019re on the precipice of our next major tipping point.\\n\\nConsumer crypto.\\n\\nIt has exploded onto the scene over the past year and continues to dominate web3\'s zeitgeist. Conferences, podcasts, thought leaders, investors, and builders are all doubling down on its themes.\\n\\nMajor investors are prioritizing consumer crypto projects, particularly in social protocols, apps, and games, highlighting the industry\'s evolving focus and future direction.\\n\\nToday, consumer crypto resembles the early days of online businesses during the dot-com boom. While many consumer-focused protocols and apps may be short-lived, a select few are poised to stand the test of time.\\n\\nCurrently, we\'re in the nascent stages of this boom.\\n\\nOver the last 5 ETH Global hackathons, 80% of builders building with Push Protocol have chosen to ship projects focused on the consumer crypto niche. This is a major shift from 4 years ago when the same could be said for NFT marketplaces.\\n\\nHowever, when you search \u201cconsumer crypto,\u201d you get a wide variety of answers as to what it is, why it matters, and where it\u2019s going.\\n\\nThere\u2019s never been a better time than now to sift through the viewpoints and fully grok it.\\n\\nIn this post, we aim to:\\n\\n***\u2022 Establish a clear definition of consumer crypto***\\n\\n***\u2022 Explore the key reasons for its importance***\\n\\n***\u2022 Comment on its future trajectory***\\n\\n# Defining consumer crypto\\n\\nIndustry professionals are thoroughly split on exactly how to define consumer crypto. Some suggest it all comes back to NFTs and their related token standards. Others say everything in the industry is moving towards consumer scale and has always been meant to go that route. \\n\\nOthers term it the movement focused on web3 apps that are purpose-built for everyday use by billions of people. While this is closer to the point, it doesn\u2019t quite hit the nail on the head either. \\n\\nConsumer crypto isn\u2019t solely about web3 apps becoming household names. \\n\\nIt also refers to every layer of the stack being hyper-focused on providing novel experiences powered by the blockchain, smart contracts, tokenization, and everything in between. Zooming in, it could then be said that consumer crypto is the niche of the greater crypto industry that\u2019s focused on building the future of all apps and services, powered by blockchain tech. \\n\\nHowever, that\u2019s still not quite it. \\n\\nThere\u2019s something more that needs to be included because to scale all things crypto or more accurately, all things web3, to the masses, we need improvements to every level of the industry\u2019s aggregated UX.\\n\\nHowever, this concept needs to be simplified for the average person to grasp it. To establish a universal definition for consumer crypto, it\'s important to first identify and address what isn\u2019t working.\\n\\nMost consumers object to using crypto or anything related because they don\u2019t see the need to switch to it. They return to the option they already trust and continue interacting within its walls. \\n\\nThis measure of how often users keep coming back to an app is called \u201cstickiness,\u201d and it\u2019s something that web3 apps have yet to achieve on any comparable level to web2\u2019s household names. \\n\\nThink about why Slack is sticky, even for Web3 teams. \\n\\nOnce you pass a certain threshold of all-time messages sent, it becomes the standard for communication in your workplace. It doesn\u2019t matter, in most cases, how many alternatives pop up. Your historical conversations and all the documents you\u2019ve ever shared are stored in your team\u2019s Slack.\\n\\nWhat about Google Meet?\\n\\nIt\u2019s a sticky progressive web app because it seamlessly integrates with your calendar and it just works. You can schedule a meeting in four clicks, counting inputting participating emails, and you don\u2019t even have to have a Gmail to join one you\u2019re invited to. \\n\\nPeople keep coming back because, above all else, it\u2019s intuitive to use and it doesn\u2019t lock anyone out. \\n\\nConsumer crypto, as a whole, is a vision to build out sticky apps that scale far beyond the web3 niche. All in all, the key goal is for them to be just as intuitive to use as their legacy counterparts and more attractive due to the new, on-chain-enabled features they champion.\\n\\nTo narrow down what this means, let\'s consider the rise of DeFi. \\n\\nSince 2020, the success of protocols like Aave, Uniswap, and Maker has demonstrated, in practice, the power of transacting with minimal fees, globally, and without intermediaries. Truthfully, the term DeFi, stretches far beyond these protocols and their counterparts to all of crypto that deals in financial use cases. Even Bitcoin, for example, may be considered \u201cDeFi,\u201d when it is used to store value, or simply, to do business. \\n\\nAs institutions like Blackrock continue to buy in, that\u2019s only becoming clearer by the day. \\n\\nWhile both DeFi and consumer crypto are niches within the same industry, they have considerably different target markets. DeFi aims to provide the future financial system, piece by piece, to institutions, traders, and individuals. \\n\\nConsumer Crypto is the vision of developing intuitive, sticky, and user-governed applications that leverage blockchain technology to deliver seamless, chain-abstracted experiences. These applications extend beyond financial services, enabling any user to engage with a diverse range of web3 applications for various purposes, fostering widespread adoption, and enhancing everyday digital interactions.\\n\\nBelow, we dig into why that needs to be done, and how we, as builders, can do it. \\n\\n# Why does consumer crypto matter?\\n\\nThe top hurdle for web3, as a whole, continues to be how inaccessible it is to the average person. To change that, we need to commit to radically improving how we onboard new users to our apps, how we seek to retain them, and what use cases we\u2019re building for as well as supporting, through grants programs, hackathons, and otherwise. \\n\\nOnce we achieve this, it will become clear why consumer crypto is essential and why it represents the next paradigm shift for all consumer apps.\\n\\n**Seamless Onboarding**\\n\\nFrom approval signatures to bridging, to holding multiple tokens just for gas fees on different networks, to managing multiple wallets, [and beyond](https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/), web3 apps are rife with complexity. Changing the status quo requires unifying the user experience regardless of all these intricacies. \\n\\nA commitment to learning from web2\u2019s successes and failures is a good start. \\n\\nChain abstraction across the board, [as we describe in a past post here](https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/), takes us further. \\n\\nSpinning up an account on a web3 app must be as easy if not easier than doing so on something like Facebook.  Simplicity needs to reign across the board in our approach to UX and we need to commit to benchmarking to leading legacy apps that are household names to ensure this happens. Moreover, putting all of the innovations that make this industry great on the back end does not mean hiding them. \\n\\nUntil all of this is achieved, onboarding will continue to be a major barrier to widespread adoption and the advent of an age in which on-chain apps supplant off-chain apps. \\n\\n**Long-Term Retention**\\n\\nRaising retention is a multi-sided problem. To retain users over the long-term, we must ensure better and seamless UX.\\n\\nWith web2\u2019s common approaches to it and the unique features that web3 has in mind, it becomes easier to solve. \\n\\nThink about the apps you have on your phone. What reminds you to check them? Push notifications. There\u2019s a reason we still need them, even in this space. When done right, they\u2019re one of the most effective methods that apps employ to retain users. \\n\\nWhen your phone\u2019s locked and you receive a push notification saying that you got a new message from a friend on an app, you check that app. It\u2019s a reflex, in most cases. The same principle applies to web3. If you\u2019re a trader and you get a push notification in your wallet that says the asset you\u2019re tracking has reached the price you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019ll head to your account and trade that asset. Delegates for a DAO who receive the same sort of notification that a vote has begun will head to Snapshot or wherever that vote is being held to participate. The same goes for fans of a particular NFT artist who receive a ping that a new drop is live or fans of a podcaster who see that a new episode is live. \\n\\nPush notifications are still key to keeping people engaged, even on-chain. \\n\\nBeyond push notifications, numerous other methods for enhancing user retention exist, both predating web3 and emerging from it. The initial rise of NFTs has already shown the power of royalties, guaranteed in perpetuity, by smart contracts. Most legacy marketplaces and social media platforms offer only negligible profit-sharing, if any. \\n\\nIt\u2019s the call for change we\u2019ve seen since the earliest days of social media. Give us apps that prioritize the users, including creators, first, above all else. \\n\\nAdd in DAOs as well as the lego-like composability that smart contract-based applications have and you\u2019re starting to get the picture as to how consumer crypto can do that. At present, both creators and general users lack meaningful upside in the apps they use daily. Any significant gains\u2014monetary or otherwise\u2014are subject to the whims of centralized entities. \\n\\nUser-led apps flip the status quo on its head, for the better. \\n\\nIf something isn\u2019t working, it can be changed via a vote. Apps evolve based directly on what their communities want to see and any advertising that is done is opt-in. \\n\\nAny revenue that\u2019s generated goes both to the app itself, to keep the lights on and keep it scaling, and to its community, with the latter receiving the lion\u2019s share. \\n\\nToken-based incentives such as higher statuses and higher rewards based on longevity and participation further increase retention even further.  \\n\\n**Diversification of Use Cases** \\n\\nHowever, none of the above matters if we, as an industry, can\'t demonstrate a stronger commitment to a broader range of use cases for our apps. Currently, the majority of existing web3 apps are DeFi-focused.\\n\\nConsumer crypto aims to change that by providing intuitive, fun, sticky apps that rival those that are today\u2019s leaders in the social media, gaming, and marketplace niches. Chain abstraction, [cross-chain requests](https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/), and [related solutions](https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/) are making it easier than ever for that to happen.  \\n\\nAs previously mentioned, through recent hackathons, we\u2019re already able to see consumer apps leading the charge.\\n\\nConsumer crypto matters because it\u2019s the movement through which web3 expands its boundaries to the next billion users. \\n\\nIt\u2019s the only way that we finally cross the chasm to being the standard-bearers for all online interaction instead of a tech-heavy alternative. \\n\\nOnce everyone in our industry shows commitment to that in practice, consumer crypto will become the dominant driving force for the industry\u2019s move to expand crypto beyond finance and achieve widespread adoption. \\n\\n# What\u2019s the future of consumer crypto?\\n\\nSince Bitcoin\'s inception, we\'ve advocated for a financial system and a world that levels the playing field more than ever before. Our apps need to strike a balance\u2014easy to use, yet demonstrating these principles in action. We need more engaging, participatory, on-chain economies, of all shapes and sizes, embedded within enjoyable user interfaces. \\n\\nThis doesn\u2019t require reinventing the wheel. Our next break-out moment may come from a team saying, *\u201cHow can we make a better Instagram with features and functionalities unique to this industry?\u201d*\\n\\nThat app would likely also be DAOified because you can\u2019t have consumer crypto without governance by the people, for the people. Decentralized Governance, as an overarching model for our future social apps, aligns perfectly with the broader vision of consumer crypto, as it ensures apps evolve in a more participatory fashion than ever before. Web3-app users can have a direct say in how the app they\u2019re using evolves as well as how it approaches key questions like compensation for creators, which is technically not possible in traditional web3 apps, where all control lies in the hands of the few. \\n\\nConsumer crypto is the next **Schelling** point for our industry. \\n\\nIt\'s the driving force propelling us toward a future where web3 becomes the standard for all global consumers\' online interactions. To travel further down that road, let\u2019s start by building things on-chain that people beyond our sphere, legitimately want to use. Let\u2019s also commit to making crypto easier to use than ever. \\n\\nWith that, we might reach an age in which a web3 app is just an app and a protocol is just a structure behind it. \\n\\nAn age of seamless interaction, on-chain,  where users no longer have to bother about the underlying chain behind their favorite applications.\\n\\nHere at Push, we\u2019re all aligned and focused on this vision. \\n\\nIf you\'re building in consumer crypto, then we\'re here to support you every step of the way.

What began as a general-purpose blockchain has evolved into a global, decentralized World Computer, unlocking a wave of technological innovations through the power of cryptography and decentralization.\\n\\nFast forward to today, the landscape has dramatically shifted. \\n\\nWe have over [30 Layer 2 solutions](https://dune.com/21co/layer-2-summary), numerous rollups and now even Layer 3s. With such an explosion of chains what we now have is a fragmented ecosystem where user experience is compromised, liquidity is spread thin across multiple platforms, security of assets is a major concern, and building applications in the multi-chain world is getting increasingly difficult.\\n\\n*But how did we get here?*\\n\\nThis article is designed to give a complete picture of the following:\\n\\n- *How web3 ended up with so many chains,*\\n- *How this has adversely affected the entire ecosystem,*\\n- *And, what we can do to build better web3 apps in this multi-chain world*\\n\\nLet\u2019s get started.\\n\\n### The Rise of Chains\\n\\nSince the advent of layer 1 chains, scalability and high fee (gas) requirements have been a major concern. For chains like Ethereum specifically, as the number of applications grew, so did the network\u2019s congestion and the overall cost for users.\\n\\nA significant step to resolve these issues was taken on October 02, 2020, when Vitalik introduced the [*Rollup-Centric Ethereum Roadmap*](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698). This meant Ethereum moved towards rollups as its scaling strategy because **bundling multiple transactions** **into batches** significantly increased ***transaction throughput*** and ***reduced transaction costs.***\\n\\nThis solved Ethereum\'s scalability issue effectively as it reduced the load on the Layer 1 chain and provided cheaper transaction fees. However, we soon realized that the rollup-centric roadmap had led to the development of plethora of new L2s, Rollup solutions, and even L3s. This expansion has enabled greater scalability and reduced transaction costs, which are essential for the growth of decentralized applications (dApps). \\n\\nAdditionally, the web3 ecosystem soon realized the need for designing chains that are specifically optimized for single applications, i.e. app-specific chains. Technically, this seemed necessary to ensure that these applications could achieve optimal performance, security, and user experience tailored to their unique requirements without being affected by the general-purpose network congestion and fees of more generic Layer 1 or Layer 2 solutions.\\n\\nWhile app-specific chains achieved the desired outcome by optimizing for their specific needs, this again led to the creation of multiple new chains. L3s as applications like dYdX, Hyperliquid, or Frax became standalone app chains or rollups of their own.\\n\\nThis inception of new rollups, app chains, L2, and L3s undoubtedly resolved quite a few key issues of the ecosystem like *scalability, block space, network usage fees*, etc. However, it also led to another significant concern for web3 users and devs.\\n\\nA deep dive into this topic will lead us to many concerns that arise with the significant proliferation of chains such as f*ragmentation of liquidity across chains, inadequate incentive management, broken user experience, difficulties for developers, security risks, etc.*  \\n\\nHowever, in this article, we will primarily focus on the ones that affect either the existing users or the newcomers.\\n\\n### The Fall of Web3 UX\\n\\nAs the number of chains has multiplied, so have the challenges, particularly in terms of user experience (UX). With the rise of these new chains, the overall UX of web3 has become increasingly complex for the average user to navigate. \\n\\nHere is a quick glance at what a typical web3 user needs to deal with in this multi-chain universe:\\n\\n- *managing multiple wallets,*\\n- *managing multiple native tokens/assets in their multiple wallets,*\\n- *understanding the nuances of each network,*\\n- *navigating multiple networks to perform simple tasks,*\\n- *interacting with complicated dapp UIs with frequent network switching*\\n- *navigate through inconsistent user interfaces*\\n- *relying on the risky route of cross-chain bridging between chains*\\n- *experiencing difficulty in maintaining a consistent cross-chain identity due to the multi-chain ecosystem*\\n- *dealing with the lack of standardization between networks, protocols, etc*\\n- *dealing with the learning curve of understanding different networks, each with its own set of rules, interfaces, and requirements.*\\n\\nRemember that this is just a glance at the UX problem. There are undoubtedly more issues issues for a web3 user daily. The list is even longer when it comes to newbie web3 users.\\n\\nThe above-mentioned issues lead to a few major hurdles for not just users but also for developers as well as the entire web3 ecosystem: \\n\\n**Fragmented User Experience**\\n\\nThe main drawback of navigating a multi-chain world is, well, the ***multiple chains*** (*instead of just one)*. And that leads to a completely fragmented user experience. \\n\\nA continual requirement for users to switch between chains, often using different wallets or interfaces for each one makes it challenging for users to keep track of their assets or manage their interactions with dApps. As a result, many find the Web3 experience confusing and overwhelming, which can deter them from using these services altogether.\\n\\n**User Retention Challenges**\\n\\nPoor UX can directly impact user retention. \\n\\nTruth be told, it already is impacting user retention.\\n\\nWhen users encounter difficulties in navigating the web3 ecosystem, they are less likely to return to it. High-profile dApps that have struggled with user retention due to UX issues serve as cautionary tales for new projects entering the space. Complex interfaces, slow transaction times, and confusing wallet setups have all contributed to a decline in user engagement and adoption.\\n\\n**Security and Trust Concerns**\\n\\nThe complexity of managing multiple chains also introduces security risks. \\n\\nUsers must ensure that they are interacting with the correct chain, using the right wallet, and understanding the implications of each transaction. This complexity increases the likelihood of user errors, such as sending assets to the wrong address or falling victim to phishing attacks.\\n\\nFurthermore, the process of bridging assets between these chains is quite often cumbersome and fraught with risks. Users must rely on various bridging protocols, which not only add to the complexity but also introduce potential security vulnerabilities. For instance, a user willing to move tokens from Ethereum to an L2 solution must navigate multiple steps, including wrapping and unwrapping tokens, which can be a deterrent for new users.\\n\\n**Increased Complexity for Builders**\\n\\nThe rise of multiple chains was never just a UX problem for the users of web3. There\u2019s more to it. It has also introduced a host of extra challenges for developers and builders in the space. \\n\\nFor example, each chain often has its own development tools, SDKs, and environments that developers must learn & adapt to, which can be time-consuming and lead to inconsistencies in development practices. Maintaining applications that operate across multiple chains requires managing multiple codebases or conditional code paths. This can lead to significant maintenance overhead, especially when chains update their protocols or APIs.\\n\\nEach additional chain integrated into an application introduces new potential vulnerabilities. Developers must ensure that the security of cross-chain interactions is robust, as any weakness could lead to exploits or hacks. \\n\\nFurthermore, developing for a multi-chain ecosystem that still lacks adequate standardization - is costly. It requires more time and resources, as developers need to learn and implement different protocols, test on multiple platforms, and ensure compatibility across the whole environment involved. The additional cost of extensive security audits makes the process of building & maintaining apps even more difficult.\\n\\n**Barrier to Mass Adoption**\\n\\nThe above-mentioned problems are issues that affect not just users but the web3 world as a whole. \\n\\nOne of the biggest barriers to the mass adoption of Web3 is poor UX. While early adopters and tech-savvy users may be willing to navigate the complexities of the blockchain, the average user is likely to be put off by the steep learning curve. To achieve widespread adoption, Web3 dApps must prioritize UX and make it as easy as possible for users to interact with their services. This means simplifying interfaces, reducing the need for users to understand the underlying technology, and providing clear, concise instructions.\\n\\n### So, What Can We Do About It?\\n\\nWeb3 has come as far as it has today by collaborating to solve the major problems of the ecosystem from providing decentralized infrastructure to solving scalability concerns. The current major problem, however, is the fragmented and broken UX of web3 apps.\\n\\nFortunately, some teams and protocols have some of the best minds in the industry, already working on solving this problem.\\n\\nOne of the major roadmap items of Ethereum, for instance, is its plans to fix the fragmented ecosystem with [***Universal Synchronous Composability***](https://ethcc.io/archive/universal-synchronous-composability), which undoubtedly would be a massive step towards solving the fragmented world we have today as well as towards providing a better UX for users.\\n\\nFrameworks like [CAKE](https://frontier.tech/the-cake-framework) by Frontier Research as well as protocols like Socket, Particle Network, etc., are all building solutions to provide an abstracted user experience for web3 users where they no longer have to bother about the underlying chains, *which in itself resolves more than half of web3 users\u2019 UX issues.* \\n\\nMost of these solutions, however, are currently in their nascent stages and it will still take a significant amount of time for them to shape the overall fragmented UX of Ethereum.\\n\\nMoreover, this does not indicate that it all has been addressed. As web3 builders or protocols, we can still do more to expand the boundaries for improving web3 UX. There are still a few imperative actions that we can take to enhance the experience for our users because as previously mentioned - ***good UX for users impacts the overall web3 ecosystem positively.***\\n\\nIn fact, some of those actions can be taken instantly to improve your applications.\\n\\n1. **A UX-First Approach to App Development**\\n    \\n    In simpler terms, this means building your apps in a way that even a newbie web3 user can navigate without having to read a single page of documentation or reach out to you for extra support.\\n    \\n    Most web3 applications are usually built with native web3 users in mind. It is simply assumed that users should be well aware of what a *hexadecimal blockchain address* looks like or what *blockchain-based* *transactions* mean.\\n    \\n    Dapps with such assumptions, while easy to build, are a nightmare for new users who aren\u2019t tech-savvy and this leads to a bad UX for most users.\\n    \\n    To combat this, apps should focus on creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that abstract away the complexity of interacting with the blockchain - *as much as possible*. This includes providing clear instructions, reducing the number of steps required to complete a transaction, and ensuring that users have access to all of the information they need to make informed decisions. \\n    \\n    Thus, focus on creating apps with user-friendly designs that prioritize seamless interactions and accessibility.\\n    \\n2. **Provide Cross-Chain Support & Solutions If required**\\n    \\n    Cross-chain interoperability is another critical solution for improving Web3 UX. By enabling seamless communication between different chains, interoperability protocols can reduce the complexity of navigating a multi-chain environment.\\n    \\n    If your protocol spreads across multiple chains, you need to figure out ways to make it seamless for your users to navigate through it and the apps built on top of it. Including cross-chain solutions for such cases eventually leads to a better UX for your users.\\n    \\n    A good example of this in practice is how Push leverages cross-chain solutions for its [CCR feature](https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/) which primarily aims to improve the experience for the users.\\n    \\n3. **Incentive Structure for Seamless UX**\\n    \\n    Incentivization could play a key role as well. To encourage developers to prioritize UX, dApps can create incentive structures that reward user-centric design.\\n    \\n    This could include offering grants to developers who create user-friendly interfaces, and focus on solving UX challenges in multi-chain environments. This could help fund the creation of tools and features that reduce friction for users by either optimizing existing pieces of software for better performance or simplifying user interfaces.\\n    \\n4. **Good UX is more than just a User Interface**\\n    \\n    A common misconception is to equate good UX solely with fast and visually appealing user interfaces. In reality, a truly great UX goes far beyond just the front-end design.\\n    \\n    Two critical components that significantly enhance the overall UX for your users are ***usability and trust.***\\n    \\n    Unlike traditional Web2 apps, Web3 applications interact with smart contracts, which require gas fees for any on-chain operations. Optimizing these smart contracts to minimize gas consumption is essential. By doing so, you ensure that users can engage with your dApp more cost-effectively, directly improving usability and making your application more accessible to a broader audience.\\n    \\n    Moreover, robust security features and a commitment to transparency with users are fundamental to building **reliability and trust.** In the Web3 space, where apps interact with immutable databases\u2014the blockchain\u2014users must be confident in the safety of their transactions. Since most on-chain transactions are irreversible, providing clear security warnings before users commit and giving detailed error messages, and transparent indicators of transaction statuses (including estimated processing times) are crucial for fostering trust.\\n    \\n    In addition, conducting thorough audits of your smart contracts to mitigate the risk of exploits is not just a security measure but a vital aspect of UX. Ensuring that users\' assets are safe builds confidence and reliability in your app, which is indispensable for an overall positive user experience.\\n    \\n\\n### Building a Web3 App in a Multi-Chain World\\n\\nPush Protocol has always aimed to improve the overall user experience for not just its own users but the entire web3 ecosystem.\\n\\nSince the launch of our dapp, we have led with the incorporation of a UX-Driven and Security-First approach. Be it visual interface changes to the dapp, optimizations of our smart contract, or enabling gasless opt-ins for smooth dapp interactions, we continue to put this into practice across the board.\\n\\nHere is a quick glance at the evolution of the Push Dapp since its early days.\\n\\n![Push DApp](cover-image1.webp)   \\n\\nHowever, as previously mentioned, UX is more than just user interface improvements.\\n\\nIn particular, maintaining an excellent UX in web3 app with such a fragmented ecosystem could be very challenging. \\n\\nWe faced a similar challenge as well.\\n\\nPush has built a communication & notification layer for all EVM (*and soon, Non-EVM*) chains. This means our dapp supports multiple chains which leads to a fragmented experience where user have to frequently switch between chains to perform various actions.\\n\\nA major improvement to resolve this was recently proposed in the PRE-PIP 3 of Push Governance, i.e., [***Cross Chain Requests.***](https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794) \\n\\n**Cross Chain Requests ( CCR)**\xa0feature shall be one of the most significant features of Push Smart Contracts as it will enable users to perform important actions like c*hannel creation, creation of Incentivized Chat requests, or any arbitrary request*\xa0from the chain of their choice.\\n\\nThe core idea of the Cross Chain Request feature is to\xa0**make Push smart contracts capable of handling requests that can originate from any chain and are securely relayed to Push Core contracts on Ethereum for necessary validations & state changes.**\\n\\nIn other words, we shall be able to provide an abstracted experience to our users, one in which they no longer have to care about switching to a specific network to interact with the dapp. Users can choose to stay on their preferred chain and the dapp shall be able to handle the rest, thus providing a significantly improved UX in the currently fragmented multi-chain world of Web3.  \\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe rise of multi-chain environments has undoubtedly brought about significant advancements in scalability and efficiency within the Web3 ecosystem. However, this growth has also introduced new challenges, particularly regarding user experience. As dApps continue to evolve and expand across multiple chains, it is crucial to prioritize UX to ensure that users can navigate the ecosystem with ease. \\n\\nBy focusing on creating unified experiences, leveraging cross-chain interoperability solutions, and simplifying user interfaces, web3 apps can overcome the challenges of a multi-chain world and hopefully drive mass adoption of web3 technology.\\n\\nTo achieve mainstream adoption, it\'s now imperative that web3 finds ways to streamline these experiences, making it easier for average users to navigate the complex landscape of multiple chains and protocols."},{"id":"cold-start-solutions-scaling-consumer-crypto","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/cold-start-solutions-scaling-consumer-crypto","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-30-cold-start-solutions-scaling-consumer-crypto/index.md","title":"Cold Start Solutions: Scaling Consumer Crypto","description":"Cold Start Solutions: Scaling Consumer Crypto","date":"2024-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 30, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Consumer Crypto","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/consumer-crypto"},{"label":"Insights","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/insights"}],"readingTime":8.086666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ian LeViness","url":"https://x.com/ExpatCrypto3","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorian.png","key":"ian"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"cold-start-solutions-scaling-consumer-crypto","title":"Cold Start Solutions: Scaling Consumer Crypto","authors":["ian"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Cold Start Solutions: Scaling Consumer Crypto","text":"We\u2019ve gone from wen moon to wen widespread adoption?

We, as builders, stick around in this wild, wonderful space we call home because we envision a more transparent, fairer, and overall better internet. \\n\\nWe want social networks that we\u2019re never actually locked into. We want user-run apps. We envision a world in which we truly own what we share online, whether that\u2019s our messages, our photos, or simply, our data. \\n\\nOwnership of the internet by the collective rather than the few is and always will be a key part of what we\u2019re all doing here. Still, why do 95% of consumers know what crypto is but only 22% actively use anything that constitutes a \u201ccrypto application?\u201d How do we reach an age in which Dapps are just apps and in which web3 is just \u201cthe internet?\u201d\\n\\nHow do we unify the world under one banner?\\n\\nTo even begin to answer any of these questions, we need to both understand why we haven\u2019t quite crossed the chasm. We\u2019ve redefined what the financial system and, the internet as a whole can be, but we haven\u2019t gotten the greater global population to buy in. \\n\\nBy looking at how different projects, networks, and platforms, both in and outside of crypto, have overcome the \\"cold start problem,\\" you can piece together a playbook to set your Dapp up to cross the chasm to widespread adoption.\\n\\nFor our purposes, we\u2019ll be examining all cases under the umbrella of platforms, since almost every popular app, Dapp, or network today has turned out to be one. \\n\\n### What is the Cold Start Problem and why should anyone care?\\n\\nYou\u2019ve built an app. You believe it\u2019s the next place where everyone will gather to connect and share content online. It\u2019s going to be the next member of the \u201cbillion users club.\u201d \\n\\nEverything\u2019s in place technically and yet, there\u2019s one problem. You don\u2019t have any users and you don\u2019t have anything for them to share.\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve built an Airbnb without listings and users, a YouTube without videos, or a social network without content and users, then you\u2019ve faced the cold start problem. Trying to figure out how to set the right baseline of producers(or just content) and consumers to set your app(or platform) up for success means solving the cold start problem. \\n\\nIn the context of web3, a cold start refers to launching a Dapp that has no user base yet. Alternatively, it can be defined as determining how to attract an initial user base that will engage with the Dapp in the exact ways needed to scale it from 0 to a wide audience. \\n\\nKnowing how to address the cold start problem requires understanding how others have already done so and there\u2019s no better place to begin than with some of web2\u2019s most explosive successes. \\n\\n### Zoom: It\u2019s easy and it just works\\n\\nThere\u2019s something to be said for a product that\u2019s dedicated to being as reliable as possible and as easy as possible to use. When Zoom rose to prominence during the pandemic, some claimed that its meteoric growth was simply due to luck and timing. \\n\\nThis, however, is only half of the truth.\\n\\nThey had both the right timing and the right product. \\n\\nOn the surface, Zoom appeared to be just another videoconferencing option, but two key actors prepared it to become the giant it is today. First, it was and continues to be dedicated to making every aspect of the user experience radically simple. You could and can still join a meeting just by clicking a link. Everything from reacting to a speaker to sending a message to changing your background, to integrating your planned meetings with your calendar was made as easy as possible to do. \\n\\nDuring a time when we were more desperate than ever to connect with people, it became the most reliable option. The fact that it continued to run nearly seamlessly for up to 100 users per meeting via the free tier and 300+ on the higher tiers only added to its popularity. \\n\\nPerhaps you\u2019ll find Zoom\u2019s example to be inspiring and perhaps not. Admittedly, Zoom has now also faced its share of issues. Even so, web3 builders can still learn from its team\u2019s dedication to facilitating seamless onboarding and making the product \u201cjust work\u201d above all else. \\n\\n**Key takeaways from Zoom\u2019s example:**\\n\\n- Reducing the number of signatures required for sign-up to your Dapp\\n- Simplifying the process of initiating transactions\\n- Integrating solutions similar to [Push\u2019s Cross Chain Requests](https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/) to take the hassle of bridging and related actions away from the end-user\\n- Stripping away complexity that could cause performance issues in the early days and focusing on the core functionalities that are explicitly needed\\n- Beta testing, through multiple iterations in a gamified fashion with points or even tokens to ensure your MVP just works\\n- Releasing your MVP once it\u2019s clear it will run without major issues\\n- Adding new features with direct user input through community calls, surveys, and other direct methods like the governance process, as your Dapp\u2019s user base grows\\n\\nWith a list such as the above, you\u2019ll be off to a good start. Still, having a killer product is only one piece of the puzzle. Solving the cold start problem also means having the right mix of users in place, or, as Alexis Ohanian puts it, \u201cthe minimum viable community,\u201d from day one. \\n\\n### Bank of America and Bitcoin: Atomic Networks Lead to Hyperscaling\\n\\nTo define \u201cminimum viable community,\u201d and why it matters, let\u2019s begin by considering the invention of the consumer credit card. On September 18, 1958, Bank of America mailed the first credit cards to 60,000 residents of Fresno, California. These cards were pre-loaded with $300-$500 of credit and required no application process. \\n\\nIn one day, 60,000 cardholders came into being. This resulted in 300 Fresno-based merchants signing up to support Bank of America\u2019s new network. In just over a year, that network grew to 2 million cardholders and 20,000 merchants. \\n\\nBank of America\u2019s gamble worked because it wasn\u2019t a gamble. Their first cardholders weren\u2019t randomly selected. At the time of the launch, 45% of Fresno residents had some sort of relationship with the bank, making Fresno the ideal spot for the first atomic network for their new credit card. \\n\\nWith their experience with Fresno in hand, the bank was able to repeat the same success repeatedly leading to their meteoric rise to prominence in the nascent space of consumer credit. \\n\\nThis is an atomic network, a unique, intentional matching of consumers and producers that just works and can be repeated to scale a networked product.\\n\\nAll successful platforms started in this manner. Still, the atomic network is only one part of the battle. Without a killer product to drive to it, your chances of scaling are virtually non-existent. \\n\\nTake Bitcoin, for example.\\n\\nIn 2009, when it launched, it already had pre-set users. The cypherpunk community. These individuals believed in widespread financial freedom, the right to privacy, and every other aspect of what is still the wind beneath the wings of the crypto industry. With the cypherpunks as its first atomic network, Bitcoin launched and continued to scale without a central authority.\\n\\n**Key takeaways from Bank of America and Bitcoin itself:**\\n\\n- Starting with a specific area or online community where people need what you\'re offering\\n- Zeroing in on that using similar approaches to how Bank of America built out its credit network and how Bitcoin built out its initial atomic network for future scale\\n- Making sure your product addresses a need expressed in the values of the group or groups involved\\n- Determining through your initial connection with that group or groups what features address a real need for them\\n- Launching with a small set of features that directly address what this initial atomic network or MVC needs\\n- Iterating and expanding based on user feedback and direct usage patterns that arise in your MVC\\n- Using your initial atomic network or MVC as a model for growth into new markets and leveraging the same messaging and overall values that attracted your pioneers\\n\\nKiller products with the right atomic networks can set a Dapp up for explosive growth but you won\u2019t gain and retain your initial atomic network without solving for the power users first. \\n\\nWhether we\u2019re speaking about a web2 app like Zoom or Bitcoin, the digital gold itself, the principle remains the same.  \\n\\n### Wikipedia, Ethereum, and DAOs: Solve for the Core Contributors First\\n\\nLast but not least, let\u2019s say you have a killer, easy-to-use product and a potential atomic network, but you\u2019re struggling with attracting your first creators. \\n\\n\u201cCreator,\u201d in this context, may be considered synonymous with \u201cproducer.\u201d  Youtubers, Bitcoin miners, developers, or even Wikipedia editors, it\u2019s all the same in this respect. In today\u2019s day and age where we\u2019re trending more and more towards every app involving a two-sided exchange, it\u2019s never been more crucial to attract and retain the right creators from the get-go. \\n\\nFor instance, Wikipedia is largely maintained by 0.02% of its users, who create and edit articles for free. They do so both because they deeply connect with Wikipedia\u2019s vision of \u201cfree access to all human knowledge,\u201d and because of the relative prestige their work gains them within their community. \\n\\nIn short, they join the effort and stay with it because they need to see the vision realized. DAOs work in the same manner. So do many crypto projects, including Ethereum itself which has consistently been able to attract and retain builders from all over the world due to its commitment to being the world computer that anyone can build on. \\n\\nThe vision rules. The core contributors create the environment for ideal collaboration which scales the network to new heights. \\n\\nWikipedia found its core contributors through sharing its vision across communities that were most likely to resonate with it, like Nupedia, and Slashdot. DAOs tend to publish manifestos, constitutions, or similar documents from day one to do the same. Ethereum used its early technical papers and its ICO, together with memorable appearances at industry events, as jump-off points. \\n\\nIn all of these cases, the founding teams led with incredible attention to detail related to who their initial target market was. \\n\\nStill, creating an environment that incentivizes consistent growth is incredibly difficult.\\n\\nSome Dapps will choose to start by surveying their core community and creating a shared vision and set of values as a collective. Some will do so via a delegation representing the whole community. Others won\u2019t need decentralized governance of any kind until the later stages of their development. \\n\\nWhile there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to attracting and keeping the first producers or \u201ccore contributors\u201d to your Dapp\u2019s growth, there are principles that tend to work across the board.\\n\\nThe below is an attempt at mapping out the steps of that effort. \\n\\n**Key takeaways from Wikipedia, Ethereum, and DAOs:**\\n\\n- Creating an impactful vision and using successful vision-driven projects as jump-offs or inspirations for doing so\\n- Aligning your project\'s vision with the values of your most active users\\n- Publishing a manifesto or a similar document indicating what you stand for and why people should care about what you are doing\\n- Creating an environment that fosters collaboration and innovation\\n- Implementing governance structures and incentives that encourage long-term commitment\\n- Ensuring that any change or new effort you put into place is a value add for your core contributors\\n- Making paths to further growth clear to every community member, whether that\u2019s how an ambassador rises to core status or something else entirely\\n- Opening up growth paths to anyone and having them stewarded by your initial core members\\n- Iterating with community sentiment and realizing that no aspect of your community, even your initial vision, is set in stone forever\\n\\n### The Consumer Crypto Playbook: A Starting Point\\n\\nWe\u2019re at a tipping point. \\n\\nBoth in and outside of the crypto space, almost all popular apps are platforms. Some sort of supplier is meeting some sort of demand. The rise of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the industry we hold dear today shifted everything further towards this point. Today, crypto-based applications are starting to break through to the mainstream, but we haven\u2019t yet had our breakout moment.\\n\\nFor now, we\u2019re still sitting on the edge of the chasm towards widespread consumer usage.\\n\\nTo make our way across, we need the right playbook for scaling Dapps which focuses on simplicity reigning across the user experience, growth beginning and consistently centering on the atomic network, and the hard side being solved from the earliest days. \\n\\nOur discussion here today is an in-roads. How you address the cold start problem is highly context-specific to what your Dapp\u2019s niche is. With all of the above takeaways at your fingertips, you have the foundation for an early-growth playbook that gets you off to a solid start. \\n\\nAs you think about any of the areas that we\u2019ve covered here, consider the following questions to help guide you even further:\\n\\n- How can you abstract away complexity from your networked product to make the user experience as easy as possible from day one?\\n- What\'s the deep purpose of the network you\'re launching?\\n- Why should people care about that purpose?\\n- Who are the groups in which you\u2019ll find those people who will become your minimum viable community?\\n- Where do those groups gather, online or offline?\\n- How can you most effectively reach them in a way that won\u2019t turn them off from what you\u2019re offering?\\n- Once you\u2019ve got your minimum viable community, what will keep them involved?\\n- What incentives will you offer to show in practice that you\u2019re dedicated to your earliest users?\\n- How will you take in community feedback and how will you show you\u2019re using it in practice?\\n- How will your product be led over time?\\n- Will you DAOify or simply decentralize a part of your product?\\n\\nWe, at Push, envision a world in which the on-chain experience is seamless and Universal Apps negate the need to understand the complexity of switching between chains. For that to happen, we need all hands working together towards the same goal.

This means, the network must create a system and rules that allows them to not just securely communicate but to also form a consensus on the overall state of the network.\\n\\nWhile it\'s a complicated task and there exists a plethora of imperative ingredients that enable security and fairness in a decentralized network, one of the most significant ones is randomness.\\n\\nRandomness, in its simplest form, refers to the lack of pattern or predictability in events. It\'s a concept that plays a crucial role in various fields, from mathematics and computer science to nature itself. Randomness is what makes a dice roll unpredictable, ensures fairness in games, and powers the algorithms behind secure cryptographic systems. In technology, especially within decentralized networks, randomness serves as a fundamental building block that underpins security and fairness, ensuring that processes are free from bias and manipulation.\\n\\nIn this article, we explore the significance of randomness in decentralized networks and how Push nodes incorporate randomness to enhance the security of the Push network.\\n\\n### Why do we even need Randomness?\\n\\nTo begin with, let\u2019s understand the importance of Randomness in decentralized networks.\\n\\nAs previously mentioned, decentralized networks don\u2019t have a central authority. Instead, they are made of a group of nodes located at different parts of the world. These nodes are responsible to act and perform certain actions in the network to keep it functional.\\n\\nThe selection of nodes to perform specific tasks must happen in a decentralized and fair manner to ensure no single actor in the network is capable of controlling the operations of the network.\\n\\nThis is where randomness plays a critical role.\\n\\nIn such decentralized systems, randomness is used to ensure the unpredictability of various processes, such as selecting validators, generating cryptographic keys, etc. \\n\\nThis unpredictability is essential to prevent malicious actors from gaining control or manipulating the network. For example, in consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake, a random selection of validators ensures that no single participant can dominate the process, thereby maintaining the decentralized nature of the network involved.\\n\\nRandomness also enhances the resilience of blockchains by making it difficult for attackers to predict or influence outcomes. This unpredictability protects against various attacks, such as Sybil attacks or collusion, where adversaries attempt to gain disproportionate control over a network.\\n\\nMoreover, randomness is vital in achieving fairness as it helps ensure that every participant has an equal opportunity to contribute and benefit from a network, regardless of their resources or influence.\\n\\nNow that we have a basic understanding of how crucial randomness is, let\u2019s understand its how Push Nodes use randomness to enhance their security and fairness.\\n\\n### Quick Glance at Push Nodes\\n\\n[Push Nodes](https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes/) are a significant step towards the decentralized infrastructure for web3\u2019s leading communication layer, the Push Protocol Network. This network is designed to facilitate secure and efficient movement of web3 notifications. \\n\\nThe Push Network comprises different types of nodes such as Validator Nodes, Storage nodes, etc. A smart contract guards the network to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the PUSH token is used.\\n\\n### How the Push Network uses Randomness to enhance its Security\\n\\nIn this section, we will specifically understand the complete mechanism of how a transaction is submitted onto Push network and the role of randomness involved in the process.\\n\\nIn the Push Network, the role of randomization is incorporated at multiple levels which allows the network to prevent centralization while ensuring that it remains resilient against a variety of attacks. \\n\\nA crucial security mechanism of the Push Chain is the randomized selection of validators for transaction validation or block production. This mechanism leverages cryptographic randomness to ensure an unpredictable selection of validators &\xa0attestants ( *who verify whether or not a transaction is legit* ) to enhance the network\u2019s resilience and fairness.\\n\\nA brief overview of the process looks something like this:\\n\\n- To send a transaction to the network, the SDK/sender must attach a randomly generated token number to the transaction.\\n- To fetch this token, the SDK can request the same from any validator.\\n- Once received, the SDK attaches this token to the transaction and sends it to the network.\\n- The network then uses this random token to cryptographically decide the specific validator to verify the particular transaction for further processing.\\n- Additionally, the validator also randomly decides the validator set responsible for attesting to the transaction.\\n\\n### **Now, let\u2019s dive deeper into the Randomness of the Push Network:**\\n\\nThe Push SDK selects a random validator (VR1) to generate a special signed (RANDX) hex token. \\n\\nThe generation is performed as follows:\\n\\n1. **Generation of a Random Token:**\\n    \\n    The network is designed to ensure that a random token cannot merely be generated by a single validator. Instead, it must be a combined effort as every random token is ideally a collection of digitally signed pieces of random numbers provided by specific validators in the network.\\n    \\n    To determine the exact number of such pieces required to form the token, the Validator.sol smart contract defines a parameter called `*required_random_number`.* This indicates the number of required random peers whose signed values each validator must hold, at a given time. Additionally, the contract also defines an `*expiration_time*` parameter that defines the expiry time for these tokens which helps ensure that only freshly created tokens can be used for the creation of random tokens.\\n    \\n    It should be kept in mind that validators in the network periodically ping their peers to collect and exchange signed random values. The collected value from each validator is a combination of the random value itself and the validator\'s signature, ensuring it can be verifiable.\\n    \\n    ```jsx\\n    signedRandomValue = value + validatorSignature\\n    ```\\n    \\n    As a result, at any given moment the validators should have a collection of signed random values by their peers, i.e., **`signedRandomValue[].`**\\n    \\n    Once a validator has accumulated the necessary signed random values, it can generate the random token. This token is derived from the network\'s collective randomness using the following formula:\\n    \\n    ```jsx\\n    RANDX_Token = XOR(sha(signedRandomValue[i])) for all i\\n    ```\\n    \\n    1. **The SDK Requests for a Random Token** \\n        \\n        Next, now let\u2019s understand what happens when the SDK requests for a random token.\\n        \\n        As previously mentioned, before sending any transaction to the network, the SDK\xa0 requests for a random token that must be attached with the transaction being sent.\\n        \\n        Now, since a random token value has already been generated ( as mentioned in step 1), any validator can provide this random token to the SDK.\\n        \\n        The SDK then attaches this random token to the transaction payloads and sends the transaction to the network.\\n        \\n    2. **Randomized Selection of Validators**\\n        \\n        This random token attached to the transaction plays a crucial role in randomly deciding which validator will process the transaction. With this token, the SDK deciphers the validator ID, to whom it must send the transaction for further processing. \\n        \\n        ```jsx\\n        validator_id = f( RANDX_TOKEN, contract_defaults)\\n        \\n        //OUTPUT looks like: \\n        validator_id = v1\\n        \\n        where contract default parameters could be:\\n        a. min required quantity of random numbers,\\n        b. expiration time,\\n        c. a minimum number of peers that acknowledge the validator\'s online status.\\n        ```\\n        \\n        Upon receiving the transaction, the validator checks the random token in the transaction\u2019s payload and validates it to confirm that it has been correctly assigned the role of handling this transaction. \\n        \\n        In case the validator identifies that it has been wrongly chosen, ***it can reject the transaction.***\\n        \\n        Once the accurate assignment of the validator is confirmed, the validator now creates a similar randomized process for creating a list of validators who must attest to the transaction being processed.\\n        \\n        ```jsx\\n        vlist = f(RANDX_Token_2nd, contract_defaults)\\n        \\n        // Output looks like this:\\n        vlist = V2, V50, V11, V8, V38, V17, V29\\n        ```\\n        \\n        This list of validators is also responsible for verifying its **legitimacy.**\\n        \\n    \\n    ### Summary\\n    \\n    To summarize, the entire process detailed above adds a security layer with the inclusion of randomization at multiple levels, i.e.,:\\n    \\n    - **1st Level:** The initial randomization starts with the SDK choosing any random validator to request for a token to be attached to the transaction.\\n    - **2nd Level: A token is generated** using digitally signed pieces of random values from multiple random validators instead of relying on any single actor.\\n    - **3rd Level: A specific validator is randomly selected** to create the token to be attached in the transaction occurs.\\n    - **4th Level:** The final level of randomization determines which specific validator (VR2) will process a transaction and which validator set will act as attestants to verify the transaction.\\n    \\n    This multi-level randomness ensures that at every step, the network is secure, and fair, while continuing to operate in a completely decentralized fashion."},{"id":"push-protocol-july-updates","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-protocol-july-updates","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-23-push-july-monthly-updates/index.md","title":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates: A Look Back at July","description":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates: A Look Back at July","date":"2024-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 23, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"}],"readingTime":2.7066666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-protocol-july-updates","title":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates: A Look Back at July","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates: A Look Back at July","text":"July was a monumental month for Push Protocol as we hit the huge milestone of 100 Million Push Notifications","tags":["Push Protocol","Web3","Blockchain Technology"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Role of Randomness in Push Nodes","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/the-role-of-randomness-in-push-nodes"},"nextItem":{"title":"Now anyone can write for Push","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/now-anyone-can-write-for-push-protocol"}},"content":"![Cover Image of Push Protocol Monthly Updates: A Look Back at July](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nJuly was a monumental month for Push Protocol as we hit the huge milestone of [**100 Million**](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1824491148229898313) Push Notifications.

They\u2019ll be capable of handling requests from any chain, which will then be relayed to the Ethereum-based Push core contracts for validations and state changes.\\n3. **Upgraded Incentivized Chats:** Users will be able to initiate and receive paid chats from any chain to any chain, as long as both are supported by the framework.\\n4. **Cross-Chain Requests (CCR):** This feature allows users to perform actions like creating channels or requests on any blockchain, rather than just on Ethereum. This move is essential for Push to reach a broader audience across different blockchains, including Layer 2 (L2), Layer 3 (L3), and app-specific chains, without increasing friction in the user\u2019s experience with our tech.\\n5. A new hub for builders: All of this will enable a new hub for builders to experiment and widen the boundaries of innovation with web3-based consumer apps.\\n\\nWe then moved on to Wormhole\u2019s views on the significance of the integration of Push\u2019s smart contracts with their tech:\\n\\n### Why Push x Wormhole?\\n\\nThe integration centers on making the $PUSH token natively fungible across all of the connected chains that Push wants, while enabling native-messaging of all sorts on all involved. We came up with this new multi-chain framework, the Native Token Transfer framework, to enable seamless token transfers across different chains without the need for liquidity pools or complex bridging mechanisms. We both agree that the industry needs to involve into one that is truly interoperable. This is a major step in that direction.\\n\\n### Why is Pre-PIP 3/CCR important?\\n\\nThe proposal includes detailed research and considerations, focusing on minimal changes to the existing architecture, a security-first approach, and how the technical aspects of Wormhole will enable CCR. This includes the deployment of manager and transceiver contracts on different chains and how these contracts interact with Push\u2019s existing infrastructure.\\n\\n### Why did Push choose Wormhole for this integration?\\n\\n1. **Native Token Transfer (NTT) Framework:** This framework allows for seamless token transfers across different chains without the need for liquidity pools or complex bridging mechanisms.\\n2. **Security:** Wormhole\u2019s framework is battle-tested and includes additional security measures like rate limiting.\\n3. **Future-Proofing:** The NTT framework allows Push to maintain governance control over its tokens across multiple chains, which is crucial for its ecosystem and the evolution of its DAO.\\n\\n### Overview of the Wormhole Transceiver and Security Framework:\\n\\n1. **Wormhole Transceiver:** This utilizes the general message passing layer of Wormhole, which relies on a security model with 19 independent \\"guardians\\" who verify messages. At least 13 of the 19 guardians must agree to validate a message, making the system highly secure.\\n2. **Flexibility and Future-Proofing: Wormhole\u2019s** system allows for the adding of other transceivers or message verification protocols, such as off-chain processes or ZK transceivers for enhanced security.\\n3. **Overall Security and Reliability:** Wormhole has processed over a billion messages while maintaining consistently high security and resilience across its network. The platform already provably supports the future of secure message and token transfers across chains.\\n\\n### Push Protocol and Wormhole Integration:\\n\\n1. **Security-First Approach:** Push Protocol has always and continues to prioritize security, ensuring that the deployment of tokens and messages on multiple chains is always protected and that protection always increases.\\n2. **Cross-Chain Request (CCR):** With CCR live, users will be able to execute actions (e.g., creating channels) across different chains without leaving their native chain or bridging tokens. The integration with Wormhole makes this process more seamless and efficient.\\n3. **User Experience:** Post-CCR\u2019s launch, actions like channel creation will become more straightforward, with users able to operate across chains without the hassle of managing tokens or gas fees on multiple networks to get to their intended destination.\\n\\n### The Greater Implications of CCR for Developers and Builders:\\n\\n1. **Unified API and Multi-Chain Notifications:** Developers can build once and notify everywhere, simplifying cross-chain interactions and enhancing user engagement. This reduces development complexity and improves resource management.\\n2. **Enhanced Functionality and Interoperability:** The integration allows for smart contracts on one chain to trigger notifications on another, improving the overall functionality of decentralized applications (dApps).\\n3. **Security Enhancements:** Wormhole\u2019s security features, like rate-limiting, access control, and defense mechanisms, ensure that cross-chain communications remain verifiably secure.\\n\\nThe integration of Push Protocol\'s Cross-Chain Requests (CCR) with Wormhole represents a pivotal advancement in decentralized technology. This advancement strengthens Push\u2019s security, raises its scalability, and broadens its reach across multiple blockchains, paving the way for a more connected and user-friendly Web3 experience for all. As Push continues to innovate, its partnership with Wormhole ensures that it remains on the forefront.\\n\\nTo any of you who are looking to build the future of consumer applications, reach out to our team across our networks, and we\u2019ll help you get started as CCR takes off!"},{"id":"cross-chain-requests-pre-pip","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-30-pre-pip-for-ccr/index.md","title":"Introducing Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests:","description":"Introducing Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests:","date":"2024-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 30, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"}],"readingTime":3.6233333333333335,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"cross-chain-requests-pre-pip","title":"Introducing Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests:","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Introducing Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests:","text":"Push Protocol, the leading web3 communication layer, has proposed a major upgrade with the introduction of Pre-PIP (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests (CCR).","tags":["Push Protocol","Web3","Blockchain Technology"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Push Protocol x Wormhole AMA for the Cross Chain Request Feature in Push V3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/ama-with-wormhole-for-cross-chain-requests-pre-pip"},"nextItem":{"title":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates: A Look Back at June","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/monthly-updates-june-2024"}},"content":"![Cover Image of Introducing Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nPush Protocol, the leading web3 communication layer, has proposed a major upgrade with the introduction of [Pre-PIP (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests (CCR)](https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794). This proposal aims to enable users to interact with Push Protocol smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain from any blockchain network, whether it\u2019s EVM-based or non-EVM. Once CCR is implemented, users will be able to stay on their preferred blockchain while accessing Push Protocol\'s services, offering enhanced convenience and flexibility.\\n\\n### What is CCR (Cross-Chain Requests) and its impact?\\nIn the current Push Protocol architecture, performing any important task related to channels like creating a channel, modification of a channel, changing a channel\u2019s state, etc, requires the user/protocol to interact with the Push Smart Contract which is only deployed on Ethereum Blockchain. \\n\\nThis led to a bad user experience for the user/protocol as they need to switch to the Ethereum network for any interaction they might want to do with the Push Core contract. This is currently a friction point for users who primarily operate on other EVM-compatible chains and even non-EVM users.\\n\\nCross-chain requests will eliminate the need to switch to the Ethereum Network making it possible to create a channel, use Push services, or interact with Push Protocol\u2019s Ethereum smart contract from any blockchain they like, whether it\u2019s another EVM chain or non-EVM chain.\\n\\nAdditionally, this was not just something that users faced but more for Push Protocol as it limits Push Protocol\'s ability to tap into other chains and help solve the communication/notification issues of those chains adequately. This constraint hinders the protocol from reaching a broader audience and solving communication issues across diverse blockchain environments.\\n\\nTherefore, by enabling the Cross-Chain Request feature, Push Protocol can primarily significantly enhance the UX for average users as well as channel creators/managers from not just Ethereum but multiple other EVM/Non-EVM chains as well. It also allows the protocol to expand its market reach, attract users from different chains, and foster a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem.\\n\\n### Importance of CCR (Cross-Chain Requests):\\nThe Cross Chain Requests (CCR) feature is crucial for the future success and growth of the Push Protocol:\\n1. **Enhanced User Experience:** The CCR feature will significantly enhance user experience by eliminating the need for users to switch networks or manually bridge tokens to interact with the Push Core contract on Ethereum. This streamlined process will allow users to perform key actions like channel creation and incentivize chat requests directly from their preferred blockchain, reducing both complexity and transaction costs. By making these features accessible from various chains, CCR removes barriers for new and existing users, fostering a more inclusive and user-friendly environment.\\n2. **Broader Reach:** The CCR feature will expand the reach of Push Protocol across the blockchain ecosystem. By enabling interactions from multiple EVM and non-EVM chains, CCR will not only broaden the protocol\'s user base but also tap into diverse blockchain communities that might benefit from Push\u2019s communication and notification features. This increased accessibility helps Push Protocol grow its market presence and integrate with a wider range of blockchain projects, ultimately supporting the development of a more interconnected and collaborative blockchain network.\\n3. **Revolutionizing Web3 Communications**: CCR future-proofs Push Protocol against the rapid evolution of the blockchain space. As new chains and technologies emerge, CCR\u2019s cross-chain capabilities ensure that Push Protocol remains adaptable and relevant. By leveraging established technologies like Wormhole\u2019s NTT framework and Relayers, CCR positions Push Protocol to embrace future advancements and continue delivering value to its users across an ever-expanding blockchain landscape.\\n\\n**Here\u2019s a simple overview of how CCR works:**\\n\\n1. **Initiate Request**: A user on another blockchain (like Polygon) wants to perform an action, such as creating a new channel for sending notifications.\\n2. **Submit Details**: The user uses a special function on the Push Communicator contract on their preferred blockchain to submit the request, providing the necessary details and approving the $PUSH tokens for the action.\\n3. **Send Data and Tokens**: The Push Communicator contract validates the input, creates a message payload, and uses Wormhole Relayers to securely send this payload and the $PUSH tokens to the Push Core contract on Ethereum.\\n4. **Process Request**: On Ethereum, the Push Core contract receives the message and tokens, decodes the request, validates it, and performs the required action.\\n5. **Completion**: The request is completed on Ethereum, and any unused native tokens are refunded to the user on their original blockchain.\\n\\n![Cover Image of Diagram for Cross-Chain Requests](./image1.webp)\\n\\n\\n### Visualizing Channel Creation with the CCR feature\\n\\nImagine Bob, a Polygon user, wants to create a channel for sending notifications. \\n\\nPreviously, he\'d need to switch to Ethereum, bridge tokens, and change networks. With CCR, Bob simply uses the familiar Push Communicator contract on Polygon. \\n\\nThe contract acts as a bridge, relaying Bob\'s request (channel details) and the required PUSH tokens (bridged via Wormhole) to the Push Core contract on Ethereum. \\n\\nAll behind the scenes, without Bob ever leaving Polygon! This creates a seamless experience for users on any chain, opening Push Protocol to a wider audience.\\n\\n### Why Not Just Deploy Push Core Everywhere?\\n\\nWhile putting Push Core on every blockchain might seem easy, it\'s quite tricky. \\n\\nIt would be hard to manage separate fees and keep all the information on different chains in sync, which could even be risky. \\n\\nThat\'s why we\'re improving the existing Push Communicator contracts to handle these requests. We\'ll also use a reliable system called Wormhole to securely send information and tokens between blockchains. This way, everything works smoothly without needing Push Core on every chain. For more details check out [here](https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794).\\n\\n### Implementation: How we will build CCR:\\n\\nTo implement Cross-Chain Requests (CCR), we will:\\n\\n1. Enable $Push Token for multi-chain support.\\n2. Build cross-chain support in the Push Communicator and Push Core Contract.\\n3. Use Wormhole\u2019s Relayer Interface and NTT framework for token transfers across chains.\\n4. Equip the Push Communicator to handle cross-chain actions like channel creation and requests.\\n5. Modify the Push Core Contract to process cross-chain payloads.\\n6. Conduct security audits and deploy the updated contracts on the testnet and mainnet.\\n\\nFor more details on the implementation of CCR check out [here](https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794).\\n\\n### The Future of Push Protocol:\\n\\nCCR feature is a significant step forward for Push Protocol. It paves the way for a more interconnected and user-friendly communication layer within the ever-expanding blockchain landscape. \\n\\nStay tuned for further updates as we implement CCR and empower users to unlock the full potential of Web3 communication!"},{"id":"monthly-updates-june-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/monthly-updates-june-2024","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-17-monthly-updates-june/index.md","title":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates: A Look Back at June","description":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates: A Look Back at June","date":"2024-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 17, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"}],"readingTime":2.4166666666666665,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"monthly-updates-june-2024","title":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates: A Look Back at June","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Push Protocol Monthly Updates: A Look Back at June","text":"June has been a monumental month for Push Protocol, marked by significant achievements and advancements that further strengthen our position in the Web3 ecosystem.

The common goal of this design shift is to achieve scalability and, as a result, a higher degree of interoperability.\\n\\nBut as the web3 dev community continues to take bigger strides in achieving transactional interoperability, app-to-user, app-to-app, and user-to-user communication are still at nascent steps.\\n\\nPush is working towards diminishing this divide between transactional and communication interoperability by building a robust, secure fabric that weaves multiple chains and services together by forming the **\u201cUniversal Layer2 Of Communication\u201d**.\\n\\n\\n## Fragmented Ecosystem\\n\\nWeb3 operates on a multitude of blockchains, each with its own protocols, standards, and its own unique set of rules. This creates independent and isolated silos of information, making it difficult for users, services and applications built on separate chains to interact and communicate with each other unanimously.\\n\\nPush continues to form a communication blanket over the fragmented ecosystem and provide its communication services to multiple EVM and non-EVM based chains. At present, Push supports over 7 networks including:\\n\\n- Ethereum\\n- Polyogn\\n- Polygon zkEVM\\n- Arbitrum\\n- Binance Smart Chain (BNB)\\n- Fuse\\n- Cyber\\n\\n\\n**The Communicator contracts (Push Comm V2) serve as a middleware for listening to inbound communications**\xa0and events from the Client Application\u2019s smart contract. Thus, shouldering the responsibility of on-chain communication across contracts deployed on multiple chains (EVM and non-EVM).\\n\\nNotifications can not always be triggered as a result of an on-chain event. Many notifications, especially the ones that are more inclined towards driving engagement can be considered off-chain. Push ensures that any frontend, service, backend or smart contract can easily send communication payloads across the diverse participants and devices ( App, Wallet, Extension, Frontends and more).\\n\\n\\n\\n## Data Availability (no communication DA layer)\\n\\nTraditionally, Data Availability (DA) ensures that the data needed to validate a block is accessible to the majority of network participants. However, in the context of interoperable communications within Web3, we need a broader concept: \u201c**Communication DA\u201d**.\\n\\n**What\'s the problem?** \\nFrom an end user\'s perspective, app notifications and other forms of read-write communications (messaging, groupchats, videocalls) should be accessible regardless of the platform, service, hardware and underlying chain they use.  Previously, there was no standardized middleware mechanism to link communication across platforms and chains.\\n\\nPush solves this problem. Being an open network, Push enables any frontend, service, or backend to securely tap into the Push network and extract the necessary communication payloads in a platform-agnostic manner. \\n\\nSimply put, **your communication travels with your web3 identity: your wallet.**\\n\\n\x3c!-- Push Delivery Node image --\x3e\\n![Push Delivery Nodes](./image1.webp)\\n\\n## Benefits to Protocols and DApps\\n\\n### 1. Communications \ud83e\udd1d\xa0Web 3 Wallets\\n\\nIn a typical web3 user journey, A user\u2019s wallet , is the first element that unlocks transactional interoperability by  allowing users to seamlessly transfer assets and interact with dApps regardless of their underlying set of rules.\\n\\nPush Protocol extends the scope of this interoperability by  enabling cross-chain communication in form of notifications and messaging for Dapps, wallets, and services by tying it to the wallet addresses in an open, cryptographically encrypted and gasless manner.\\n\\nNotifications from various protocols and services are accessible regardless of the chains they originate from. All subscribed channel notifications are synchronized and displayed in one place within your Push-compatible wallet.\\n\\n![Receive notifications from web3 DApps straight to your wallet](./image2.webp)\\n\x3c!-- Push mODILE SCREENSHOT image --\x3e\\n\\n### Interoperable Communication tied to web3 wallets = Secret to unlock massive distribution:\\n\\nAccording to [DApp Radar](https://dappradar.com/blog/state-of-the-dapp-industry-q1-2024), Q1 2024 saw a remarkable surge in daily active wallet users (dUAW), reaching an average of 7 million daily active wallets\u2014a 77% increase compared to the previous year.\\n\\nThe numbers clearly show that the entry into web3 starts from a wallet. With more than 120 wallet apps in market, Push presents an opportunity to revolutionise their UX by reaching to these wallet addresses. And essentially pave the way to **onboard the first Billion users into web3**.\\n\\nProtocols, services, and DApps can tap into a highly scalable  distribution stream with the help of Push. Push ties all application-specific communication to the user\'s wallet address, ensuring zero user friction and exponentially growing the client protocol\'s distribution.\\n\\n![Unlock Interoperable Communications with Push](./image3.webp)\\n\x3c!-- Push Interoperable Communications Slide --\x3e\\n\\n### Communication drives collaboration and engagement:\\n\\nNotifications delivered directly to users\' wallets enhance a DApp\'s brand recall by keeping it at the forefront of users\' minds. Users can interact with these notifications, enabling them to visit the DApp and view updates promptly.\\n\\nWhen more applications can reach out to their user\u2019s wallet, across multiple networks it opens new avenues for engagement, customer retention and brand building.\\n\\n![DApp Looker Integrating Push Notifications in platform frontend](./image4.webp)\\n\x3c!-- DApp Looker image --\x3e\\n\\n[DappLooker](https://dapplooker.com/): A no-code data analytics platform provides product and subscription related notifications. Users can enable / disable the notifications as per their wish via the platform.\\n\\n\\n## Benefits to User\\n\\n### 1. Wallet Address: A Universal Pass for Web3 Communication\\n\\nThe utility of a wallet address extends beyond simply being a social identifier or a key for facilitating transactions.  It also acts as a hub for collecting, presenting and managing mission-critical communications.\\n\\n<Image src={require(\'./image5.webp\').default} alt=\\"Push Metamask Snap\\" width=\\"353\\" height=\\"100%\\" />\\n\x3c!-- Metamask Snap --\x3e\\n\\nThe [Push MetaMask Snap](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/pushprotocol/snap/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=case_study_open_web) allows users to receive real-time notification alerts from their favourite web3 applications directly within their MetaMask wallet.\\n\\n### 2. No personal information needed:\\nPush fascilitates Native Integration with Wallet Addresses enabling communication between wallet addresses without needing personal information like email, social handles or cellular contact info.\\n\\n### 3.Security and Decentralized Communication:\\n\\nWith respect to communications, decentralization can be broken down into:\\n\\n1. Immutability of communication payloads/messages\\n2. Inability to censor content.\\n\\nPush maintains immutability and censorship resistance  by encrypting mission critical communication payloads and messaging chats ensuring highest standards of communication security.\\n\\nPush powers wallet to wallet group chat with conditional gating form over **3.8 Million users** of [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) with over 300 groups made sofar.\\n\\n\x3c!-- UD chat image --\x3e\\n![Unstoppable Domains Chat and Notifications support integrated in platform frontend](./image6.webp)\\n\\nWith the onset of [Push Network](https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=case_study_open_web) in Q4, the network will achieve its largest step in achieving complete network decentralization. Which in turn will activate slashing mechanisms to deter any nodes from censorship activities.\\n\\n## Communication Follows where wallet connects\\n\\nAcross multiple genres including, Gaming, DeFI, Governance and Wallets, Push enables multiple ways for the DApps to tap into the the protocol\u2019s Communication DA Layer (i.e Push Network) and extract notifications in a platform agnostic manner.\\n\\nFor instance, [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) users can choose to opt into and receive notifications into the platform frontend as well as receive the notifications directly into their Metamask Snap wallet.\\n\\n\x3c!-- Decentraland Image --\x3e\\n![Decentraland notification support integrated in platform frontend](./image7.webp)\\n\\nTo receive updates when of a new governance proposal from Shapeshift DAO, you can either choose to receive notifications directly in your [Shapeshift](https://shapeshift.com/wallets) wallet or perhaps any other wallet that integrates Push\u2019s open-source SDK.\\n\\n<Image src={require(\'./image8.webp\').default} alt=\\"Shapeshift Wallet\\" width=\\"353\\" height=\\"100%\\" />\\n\x3c!-- shapeshift image --\x3e\\nAdditionally, users can experience updates from the following applications powered by Push, according to their convenience:\\n\\n- **[Push DApp](https://app.push.org/welcome?utm_source=google&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=case_study_open_web)**\\n- **[Push Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/push-protocol-alpha/lbdcbpaldalgiieffakjhiccoeebchmg?utm_source=google&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=case_study_open_web)**\\n- **[Push Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.epns.epns&hl=en_IN?utm_source=google&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=case_study_open_web)**\\n- **[Push iOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/push-epns/id1528614910?utm_source=google&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=case_study_open_web)**\\n\\n## Moving across an Open Web with Push\\n\\nWe believe communications is a public good and a bare necessity for a frictionless digital life. \\nThis also means that the means to provide communications and access them should not be limited to one or atmost two mediums.\\n\\nPush invented the communication network for web3 with a similar vision of enabling communication experiences unconstrained by chains. \\n\\n**A user of chain \'X\' should not only be able to communicate with other users and services on that chain but also with users and services on chain \'Y\' seamlessly, without added friction.**\\n\\nThis is how Push is pushing towards forming a universal communication network of web3 encompassing all networks ensuring you, as a user can move across the open web along with your communications with ease."},{"id":"how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-04-how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat/index.md","title":"How to create your community on Push Chat?","description":"How to create your community on Push Chat?","date":"2024-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 4, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Wallets","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/wallets"},{"label":"Push Chat","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-chat"}],"readingTime":2.9766666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat","title":"How to create your community on Push Chat?","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"How to create your community on Push Chat?","text":"Follow this guide to get started with building your first customizale -

How to create your community on Push Chat?](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nCreating your on-chain community on Push Protocol is fairly easy.\\n\\nThis guide will walk you through the step by step process of creating your own vibrant community on Push Protocol, right from setting up a strong foundation to complete community formation.\\n\\nTo illustrate the journey, lets imagine a community dedicated to a captivating NFT collection known as \'**Charcoal Cats\ud83d\udc31**\'. In this guide we will show you, how to create a conditionally gated group chat exclusively for these Charcoal Cats admirers.\\n\\n\\nBuilding a strong online community takes more than just setting up a group chat. \\nBefore diving in to the group creation process, let\'s explore some key considerations to form a solid foundation of your community.\\n\\n### 1.Define your community\'s purpose \\n\\nMembers join and leave the communities, but what remains constant is the community\'s  purpose.\\nFind out what common interests will unite your members?  \\nFor Example : The \'Charcoal Cats\ud83d\udc31\' community is cult camp of charcoal cat NFT lovers. The access to the chat is restricted to only those wallets who hold \'Charcoal Cats\' NFT/s.\\n\\n### 2.Choose your community type\\n    \\nDo you prefer a community which is more welcoming, open & visible to all (i.e Public Group Chats) or rather prefer to form a exclusive community which is only visible to the individuals who are invited, are a part of the community or satisfy the criteria to join it.\\n    \\nPush enables both, Public and Private communities with the ability to establish gating conditions for **controlled access**.\\n\\nWith respect to our  example, lets  keep the Charcoal Cats a private community where-in the messages are encrypted and only visible upon successfully joining the group.\\n\\n\\n### 3.Decide: Open to all OR Conditionally Gated Group Chat\\n\\nGroupchats that do not impose any pre-requsite condition before joining the group can be termed as **open groupchats**.\\nFor instance, media oriented groupchats can be joined by anyone directly.\\n\\n**Conditionally Gated Chats**\\n\\nGroup chats that impose one or multiple conditions for users and allows only those users who satisfy these conditions are termed as **conditionally gated chats**.\\n\\n**Conditions are a series of criterias that can be applied for both, joining the group as well as for chatting in the group.**\\n\\n### Tailoring Access with \\"Any\\" or \\"All\\" Settings\\n\\nPush Protocol gives you further control by letting you define how users meet the set criteria. You can choose between:\\n\\n- **\'Any\' setting:** Here, users only need to meet one of the defined criteria to gain access. This allows for a more inclusive approach.\\n- **\'All\' setting:** This requires users to satisfy all the defined criteria, creating a more exclusive space.\\n\\nPush Chat provides the following settings to configure your gated chat group:\\n\\n\x3c!-- type of communities --\x3e\\n![Types of communities](./image1.webp)\\n\\n| Criteria | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| ERC20 -Tokens | User needs to hold XX token to join the group |\\n| ERC721 - NFTs | User needs to hold XX NFT to join the group. |\\n| Invite  | Both Owners and Admins can invite people to join the group. You can further customize invite privileges by specifying whether both Owner and Admin need to approve invites, or if either of them can do so independently. |\\n| Guild | Ability to set non-web3 native conditions using [Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz/) |\\n| Custom Endpoint | URL provided for custom usecases. |\\n\\n\\nSo, are you ready to build your dream community?

How Wallets use Push to become a Super App](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of Web3, as protocols become more innovative and mature, the need for web3 wallets to act as a bridge for onboarding typical Internet (web2) users into web3 with minimal friction is advancing rapidly. \\n\\nAmidst these technical advancements, communication remains a paramount factor in driving this transformation. \\n\\nToday, Push Protocol is at the forefront, enabling wallets to enhance their functionality and better serve their users by becoming a **\'Super App\u2019**.\\n\\n## Challenges\\nAccording to [DApp Radar](https://dappradar.com/blog/state-of-the-dapp-industry-q1-2024), Q1 2024 saw a remarkable surge in daily active wallet users (dUAW), reaching an average of **7 million** daily active wallets\u2014a **77%** increase compared to the previous year.\\n\\nThe numbers clearly show that the entry into web3 starts from a wallet. With more than 120 wallet apps, the sheer innovation in onboarding the next Billion users into web3 is surreal.\\n\\nAlthough wallets are expanding their utility from simply being a medium of secure storage and a facilitator of transactions to now, becoming a *\u2018Super Hub\u2019* for NFT, DeFi, and app browsing activities, they still lack the ability to consistently relay updates and alerts between the user and the accessed protocol while maintaining a constant, symbiotic and duplex communication relationship.\\n\\nIn addition, multi-chain wallets serve as a single entry point for users to interact with applications across a variety of supported chains with ease. However, there is no standardized way for these apps to communicate back with users through the same entrance point i.e. your wallet.\\n\\n\\n## Solution\\n\\n**Push helps us solve these challenges.**\\n\\nWith the help of an open - decentralized and secure network supported across multiple chains, Push facilitates any wallet, DApp, service or smart contract to tap into the network and fetch notifications with ease.\\n\\nWith the motive of forming a universal communication layer of web3, Push Protocol is expanding its support to multiple chains including **Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, Cyber and Fuse**.\\n\\nTo date, Push has sent over **80 Million Notifications** across **230k+ subscribers**.\\n\\n### Journey from Wallet to a Super App Wallet from our Partners: ###\\n\\nLets take a thorough look at how our partner wallets are adopting Push to become a Super App.\\n\\n\x3c!-- Interoperable Communications Image --\x3e\\n![Push enables interoperable communications](./image1.webp)\\n\\n\\n\\n1.

Verso Wallet\\n\\n\\n\\n### 1.Unstoppable Domains Lite Wallet\\n\\nUnstoppable Domain Wallets are cryptocurrency addresses used to store users\u2019 web3 domains in addition to tokens and digital collectables.\\nAn Unstoppable Wallet with a valid domain acts as a web3 social identifier for enabling domain-to-domain in-app messaging!\\n\\n**Push x UD: Empowering wallet-to-wallet messaging with ease!**\\n\\n\x3c!-- unstoppable lite wallet screen shot --\x3e\\n\x3c!-- ![Unstoppable Domains Lite Wallet](./image3.webp) --\x3e\\n<Image src={require(\'./image3.webp\').default} alt=\\"Unstoppable Domains Lite Wallet\\" width=\\"353\\" height=\\"100%\\" />\\n\\n\\nPush is proud to enable the next frontier of inter-domain communication by powering notifications and messaging support for over **3.58 million** UD users across more than **300 group chats**.\\n\\n\\n**What type of users primarily use Unstoppable Lite Wallet?**\\n\\nThe primary user of Unstoppable Lite Wallet are people with domains. The self-custody wallet is designed specifically for domainers, so they can manage and interact with their domains directly from the wallet in addition to traditional crypto tokens. This is a use case that has not been addressed by other wallets.\\n\\n**How does Unstopppable Lite Wallet ensure smooth UX and Communication?**\\n\\nMany of the Unstopppable Lite Wallet users are new to web3, so an intuitive and easy to use experience are essential. Inline education and clear messages help new users understand what can be a difficult learning curve.\\n\\n\\n**How does Push fit into the overall strategic goals of Unstoppable Lite Wallet?**\\n\\nMessaging is built directly into Unstoppable Lite Wallet. Push Protocol enables token gated group chat. Messaging is built directly into Unstoppable Lite Wallet.\\n\\nAs Push Protocol enables wallet to wallet token gated group chatting, depending on domains and badges, users have access to various conditionally gated group chats where they can engage with others.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Overcoming seed phrase scares using MPC**\\n\\nThe unstoppable lite wallet features advanced multi-party computation (MPC) technology provided by Fireblocks to improve safety for the self-custody wallet. Users are able to manage their wallet using an email address and password, instead of worrying about seed phrases. There is also a way to recover the wallet if the user forgets their password, adding another layer of safety.\\n\\n### 2.Metamask Snap\\n\\nMetaMask Snaps are independent feature plugins developed by third-party developers to enhance wallet experiences in areas such as communication, interoperability, security, account management, and more, for various web3 protocols and applications.\\n\\nThe Push MetaMask Snap allows users to receive real-time notification alerts from their favourite Web3 applications directly within their MetaMask wallet.\\n\\n**Push X Metamask: Unlocking a Super App experience**\\n\\n\x3c!-- metamsk snap screenshot --\x3e\\n\x3c!-- ![Push Metamask Snap](./image2.webp) --\x3e\\n<Image src={require(\'./image2.webp\').default} alt=\\"Push Metamask Snap\\" width=\\"353\\" height=\\"100%\\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMetamask being a widely popular wallet and often the first choice for many new web3 users, was crucial to integrate with Push\u2019s capabilities. The launch of the snap functionality provided an opportunity to offer a communication experience akin to web2 applications.\\n\\nThe [Push Metamask Snap](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/pushprotocol/snap/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=case_study_supper_app) was launched in September 2023 and continues to see steady growth with over **1.7k downloads.**\\n\\nThe Push  Snap is positioned at a crucial intersection in a user\u2019s DApp interaction journey through their wallet. \\n\\nInstead of frequently visiting a DApp to check the status of domain expiry or loan health indexes, Push Snap eliminates these kinds of unproductive user travels. \\n\\nUsing Push Snap, every mission-critical alert is delivered directly to the wallet as a Push Notification, providing an experience similar to a typical Web2 mobile app.\\n\\n### 3.ShapeShift Wallet\\n\\n[Shapeshift](https://app.shapeshift.com/) is an open-source multi-chain platform, offering various DeFi services. The Shapeshift wallet is a community-governed, private, non-custodial wallet that supports multiple chains and assists users in managing their portfolio and DeFi positions.\\n\\n**Push x ShapeShift  Wallet : Powering Communication**\\n\\n\x3c!-- shapeshift wallet screenshot --\x3e\\n\x3c!-- ![Shapeshift Wallet](./image4.webp) --\x3e\\n<Image src={require(\'./image4.webp\').default} alt=\\"Shapeshift Wallet\\" width=\\"353\\" height=\\"100%\\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPush powers the communication middleware for enabling Push notifications for product updates, governance updates and token transfers. \\n\\nPush powers the necessary middleware and infrastructure for [Wherever](https://www.wherever.im/), a third-party communications service to show notifications in wallet and platform frontend as well as share with the user\u2019s telegram and email.\\n\\nOn a parallel front, As users continue to become mature and conscious about on-chain security, the demand for hardware wallets will be ever-increasing. Push can also be integrated with companion Apps of Hardware Wallets like [KeepKay](https://www.keepkey.com/), ensuring user\u2019s with mission critical application updates independant of any wallet type.\\n\\nShapeShift has remained the second most subscribed channel for over a year, with a total subscriber count of more than **28,000** with a growth of more than **306%** as compared to previous year.\\n\x3c!-- shapeshift subscriber count --\x3e\\n![Shapeshift subscriber statistics](./image5.webp)\\n\\n\\n### 4.Verso Wallet:\\n\\n[Verso Wallet](https://get-verso.com/) is a non-custodial multi-chain wallet for gaming, NFT,defi, meme coins and cash backs.\\n\\nVerso bridges Web2 audiences to Web3 by enabling in-wallet crypto purchases using credit cards or bank transfers. Verso also facilitates the purchase of gift cards with crypto and provides crypto reward cashback.\\n\\n**Push x Verso Wallet : Manage all your notifications in one place**\\n\\nThe Push x Verso integration enables users to search for and opt-into any channel and receive notifications directly into the wallet. Ensuring the fact that the communications across all subscribed channels can be managed and organized easily in one place with ease!\\n\\n### Push is the missing piece for building the next Super Wallet App\ud83e\udde9:\\n\\n![Push is the missing piece of web3 wallets](./image6.webp)\\n\\n\\nAs Web3 continues to mature, user experience will be the key differentiator for wallets vying to become the go-to **\\"Super App\u201d**. And Push is determined to onboard a Billion Users to web3 by filling in the void between current and expected communication experiences.\\n\\nWith [Push Nodes](https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes/) launching soon, the Protocol will take its biggest leap in its journey to become a completely decentralized communication layer of web3."},{"id":"how-to-claim-push-alpha-access-nft","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/how-to-claim-push-alpha-access-nft","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-21-how-to-claim-push-alpha-access-nft/index.md","title":"How to claim Push Alpha Access NFT","description":"How to claim Push Alpha Access NFT","date":"2024-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 21, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"},{"label":"NFT","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/nft"}],"readingTime":0.77,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-to-claim-push-alpha-access-nft","title":"How to claim Push Alpha Access NFT","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"How to claim Push Alpha Access NFT","text":"Calling all Push Protocol enthusiasts!

Leveraging the power of Arbitrum\'s scalable, fast, and secure Layer 2 solutions, Push notifications enable real-time alerts for various blockchain activities such as transaction confirmations, governance proposals, DeFi updates, and NFT drops.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what else is there to know and get excited about? Let\u2019s dive in.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Arbitrum x Push Protocol - Revolutionizing Decentralized Interaction \\r\\n\\r\\nSince our mainnet launch in January 2022, Push has emerged as the go-to communication layer for over 700+ of the world\'s leading dApps on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/), [Polygon zkEVM](https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm), [Linea](https://linea.build/) and other blockchains.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, we\u2019re expanding our privacy-centric communication product suite to the leading Layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum, Arbitrum. With over [45.1% of the Ethereum Layer-2](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/ethereum-l2-arbitrum-base/#:~:text=It%20boasts%20a%20market%20share,a%20TVL%20of%20%247.93b.) market share and a TVL of over $15.42 Billion \u2013 Arbitrum provides some of the best tools for building scalable dApps on Ethereum and has an incredibly active user-base (with 971M in total DeFi transactions across 1.6M active wallets as of June 2024).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs such, what makes this integration so exciting is the potential utility and enhancement possibilities. Leveraging Push Notifications, Chat, and Video, we look forward to integrating with leading Arbitrum dApps to enhance how dApps and users interact.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best part of our integration: multi-chain communication. As we continue to expand our blockchain integrations, we open the door to better interoperability between users on different chains. This enhanced user-experience means fewer compromises in the way of interaction and engagement for users, and as a result, better adoption and user-stickiness. All this utility is driven by the communication infrastructure of Push Protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Push x Arbitrum: What to Expect\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the arrival of Push Protocol communication protocol, dApps and protocols on Arbitrum can begin building with web3-native notifications, chat, video, and spaces functionality. Here\u2019s what you can build with each of these communication tools:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. \ud83d\udd14<b>Push Notifications</b>: Send and receive updates from your favorite Arbitrum dApps directly into your wallet \u2013 enabling DeFi, News, NFT projects to share updates and alerts faster.\\r\\n2. \ud83d\udcac<b>Push Chat + Group Chat</b>: Enable wallet-to-wallet and wallet-to-dApp instant chat functionality \u2013 opening the door to social media platforms, customer service tools, and other social interaction enhancements.\\r\\n3. \ud83d\udcf9<b>Push Video and Space</b>: Face-to-face video chat directly on blockchain \u2013 introducing all-new interactivity on social dApps and live-streaming.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcitingly, we\u2019ve deployed the most up to date smart contracts of Push, [Push V2](https://push.org/blog/push-v2-is-live-new-rewards-utility-and-functionality/), on Arbitrum. Carrying over all the developments we\u2019ve launched so far, Customized Profiles, settings for [Notification Channels](https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings/), and notification integration with [MetaMask](https://push.org/blog/deep-dive-into-push-snaps-features-and-getting-started-all-the-technical-specifications-and-getting-started-tips-you-need/).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor builders \u2013 all new ways to engage your users and provide a stickier, more personalized user-experience are here.

This week, Estate Protocol is joining us, the leading tokenized real estate marketplace on the Arbitrum blockchain.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Estate Protocol](https://www.estateprotocol.com/) is bridging the gap between the tangible world of real estate and the boundless possibilities of the digital world by tokenizing real-world real estate, transforming properties into fractionalized digital assets through blockchain technology, ensuring security, transparency, and efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy way of this collaboration, Push assists Estate Protocol in notifying users directly on their wallets. Users can subscribe to receive notifications about new property listings, rent collection updates, and other important news. This integration ensures that users are always informed about the latest developments and opportunities within the platform, enhancing their overall experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this episode of \u201cFrens of Push\u201d, Parv Prabhakar, CEO of Estate Protocol, joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push Protocol and Estate Protocol can potentially disrupt real estate investing.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Hi Parv, what\u2019s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a research and crypto background. I\u2019ve been using digital currency in some form since I was 12 years old and was playing zynga poker on facebook selling chips for real money.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got into crypto shortly after, buying my first bitcoin on local bitcoins. I then got deeper and deeper into the tech and the finance side of it, developing arbitrage strategies. Did that across platforms and payment methods for a couple of years, and then started traveling the world and discovered cross-country strategies. Did a 300x during the 2021 bull run with delta neutral bets.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was also into writing at this time, and this Dutch art collective asked me to write an essay going into NFTs in detail about 3 years ago, during the research for it it hit me that this technology is perfect for digitizing ownership in real estate. So I started researching about how to make it happen alongside my job as a guest writer for India\u2019s biggest crypto exchange WazirX, wrote the white paper for Estate Protocol, got some peers to review and advice, and then quit the job to build this full time. The business evolved way past using NFTs too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time with Estate Protocol since then has been incredible. We tokenized the first properties in Dubai, and are working on many new innovations in the space.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tell us about Estate Protocol \u2014 what\u2019s it about and what problem does it solve?\\r\\n\\r\\nEstate Protocol is changing the global real estate market by leveraging blockchain and UK trust law to tokenize assets, and stablecoins to facilitate seamless cross-border transactions. We tokenize the world\u2019s most in demand real estate, fractionalize the ownership, and make it a part of DeFi in a compliant manner. We would soon enable lending/borrowing, and bring large REITs on the platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What\u2019s the 2024 plan for Estate Protocol and its ecosystem?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are working on bringing the world\u2019s best real estate on chain. As crypto natives, we would also be making it compatible with DeFi as far as possible. There are also some exciting partnerships currently being worked on!\\r\\n\\r\\n### How is the Estate Protocol using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\r\\n\\r\\nEstate Protocol utilizes Push\u2019s web3 communication layer to notify our users directly on their wallets. Users can [subscribe](https://app.push.org/channels/0x2A43cB483361FB5b3a09Bd11c24CbEE5cf1BE7Ca) to receive notifications about new property listings, rent collection updates, and other important news. This integration ensures that our users are always informed about the latest developments and opportunities within our platform, enhancing their overall experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\r\\n\\r\\nOur experience with Push has been positive. While it\u2019s early days since our integration, we anticipate significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction. The ability to send timely and relevant updates directly to users\u2019 wallets is a powerful tool, and we expect to see increased interaction and responsiveness from our community as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the future, we plan to leverage Push\u2019s chat feature to facilitate communication among investors in specific properties. This will enable token holders to discuss potential investments, share insights, and engage in general discussions related to real estate. By fostering a collaborative community, we believe this feature will add significant value to our platform and enhance the investment experience for our users.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Parv for the awesome conversation. Looking forward to revolutionizing web3 communication together with Estate Protocol!\\r\\n\\r\\n### About Estate Protocol:\\r\\n\\r\\nEstate Protocol tokenizes real real estate and bridges the gap between real-world assets and the digital world through blockchain.

We sent out more than **6 Million** notifications in April reaching a cumulative **74 Million notifications** since the launch and 177K subscribers. The Push journey continues to gain momentum. Here\u2019s a recap of what happened:\\n\\n## Product Updates:\\n\\nWe\'ve made significant strides in our development journey. We successfully deployed our [React Native SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/react-native-sdk) on NPM, simplifying the process for developers to access it. We\'ve also rolled out improved notification settings on app stores, allowing for a more customized user experience.\\n\\nIn our SDK, we introduced a new **ChatWidget** component and broadened our blockchain support to include **Berachain** and **Polygon Amoy**.\\n\\nOur website has been enhanced with a fresh landing page for the [Billion Reasons to Build (BRB) Bootcamp](https://push.org/bootcamp/), and we\'ve enhanced the footer for smoother navigation.\\n\\nWe\'re steadily advancing with new blockchain integrations that are currently under review. We\'ve streamlined our channel addition process by separating it from IPFS, among other improvements. We\'re in the process of developing support for SCW wallets on our Push SDK.\\n\\nOur research on the Cross Chain Feature, which enables Ethereum and Layer 2 requests, has been completed and its development is underway. The **Push Governance** contract has been redesigned to align with the updated OpenZeppelin governance structure. We\'ve managed to reduce the Smart Contract size by 30% and optimize gas fees for key functions like channel creation.\\n\\n## Partnership Updates\\n\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce new partnerships with amazing projects including [Vurse](https://twitter.com/vurse_official/status/1782414484700533169), [Rivo](https://www.rivo.xyz/), [Estate Protocol](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1778091601597960326), and [Pistachio Fi](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1780266671783194989) to integrate notifications and messaging.

We hosted a Push Video Contest asking the community to share their experience with Push Protocol. Rewarded the ultra-rare first **\u201cPush Chad\\"** role. We held an **AMA** with [Berachain](https://www.berachain.com/) - a modular EVM-compatible L1 blockchain.

In our ambassador program, we welcomed two new members for Push Protocol in the Spanish Ambassadors community and opened up five additional spots for the Push Protocol Indian Ambassadors community. We\'ve also submitted a proposal \\"[Billion Reasons to Build, Bangkok](https://forum.devcon.org/t/billion-reasons-to-build-bangkok-sea-web3-builders/3482?u=richa_joshi)\\" to host a builder-centric event at [Devcon 2024](https://devcon.org/en/), aimed at celebrating, engaging, and supporting developers.\\n\\nIn other exciting news, we managed to pass three key votes for the BD subDAO, Grants subDAO, and the DAO Council. This significant achievement has paved the way for the launch of our subDAOs on the first of June. With this, we are thrilled to introduce the community-led Push Grants V3. This new initiative opens up a world of opportunities for grantees to contribute and vote, marking an exciting new phase for Push Grants V3.

This week, we\'re joined by Roseon, a leading AI-powered cryptocurrency exchange.\\n\\nRoseon is the ultimate crypto ecosystem prioritizing user experience and gamification. It includes RoseonX, an AI-driven exchange with a modular architecture, and DeFi SuperApp, a one-stop mobile crypto app. With over 330K+ users and a global reach of 750K, it aims to boost crypto adoption and optimize investments.\\n\\nBy way of this collaboration, Push helps Roseon keep its users in the loop by sending important updates like order executions & liquidation directly to their wallets, [RoseonX Notification Channel](http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE). Roseon is also working on adding Push notifications to RoseonX, so users can get updates right on the platform.\\n\\nIn this episode of \u201cFrens of Push\u201d, Elle - Marketing Executive at Roseon joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push and Roseon has the potential to change the way we communicate in web3.\\n\\n**1. Hi Elle, what\u2019s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?**\\n\\nHello everyone, this is Elle, and I work as Marketing Exec at Roseon. My fascination with blockchain and cryptography sparked in 2021, and it truly felt like stepping into a whole new world. Fast forward to today, and I\u2019m thrilled to be part of the incredible team at Roseon. Who would\'ve thought that my curiosity would lead me here? Life works in mysterious ways, doesn\'t it?\\n\\n**2. Tell us about Roseon Exchange \u2014 what\u2019s it about and what problem does Roseon solve?**\\n\\nRoseonX is an AI-powered exchange with Modular Architecture. So, to give you the full story, it all started with the goal of bridging the gap between CeFi and DeFi, making crypto easily accessible. Our first mobile crypto app, RoseonApp, boasts over 300,000 registered users, with a peak of 20,000 daily active users. We were proud to be ranked among the Top 9 stars in BNB Chain Web3 Stars Accelerator Vietnam.\\n\\nFueled by our visionary spirit, we made a strategic decision to pivot and delve into the development of our second product, RoseonX - initially a Gamified Derivatives DEX. Our approach embraces gamification, injecting a fresh level of engagement, fun, and excitement into crypto earning, trading, and DeFi in general. More recently, our whitepaper has evolved with the integration of AI, Copy Trading, and the Strategy Vault, transforming RoseonX into an AI Powered Exchange with Modular Architecture. This leap is geared towards enhancing the overall user experience in trading and other DeFi activities. Coupled with a friendly UI/UX, our aim is to drive mass adoption of our platform.\\n\\nWe\'re thrilled about the direction RoseonX is taking, and we\'re excited to bring this innovative approach to the world of crypto and DeFi.\\n\\n**3. What\u2019s the 2024 plan for Roseon Exchange and its ecosystem?**\\n\\nOur primary aim is to bring our new roadmap to life, complete with the AI Layer, Copy Trade, Strategy Vault, and more, as well as the official release of RoseonX.\\n\\n**4. How is the Roseon Exchange using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?**\\n\\nAt present, RoseonX users stay informed about updates through the Push feature by opting into [RoseonX channels](http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE). We\'re also in the process of integrating Push directly into RoseonX, allowing users to receive notifications right within our DEX.\\n\\n**5. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?**\\n\\nWe\'ve had community members share how the Push feature has been really helpful for them, as it keeps them directly informed through their MetaMask wallet.\\n\\n**6. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?**\\n\\nI\'m genuinely excited about the Push chat between wallets. It\'s such a cool feature, especially with all the functionalities like group chat, video calls, spaces, and streaming. This feature has the potential to bring a whole new level of interaction and convenience to users, and I can\'t wait to see it in action.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThanks, Elle for the awesome conversation.

This week, our fren is QuickSwap, the leading DEX & AMM on Polygon.\\n\\nQuickSwap is the leading DEX on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, and Dogechain that\u2019s fully decentralized and community-driven, building a comprehensive suite of DeFi products called the DragonFi ecosystem. It\u2019s renowned for its high-performance, cost-efficient DeFi platforms, and pioneering role in onboarding new users and capital to the broader Polygon ecosystem.\\n\\nBy way of this collaboration, Push provides QuickSwap with the infrastructure to facilitate its users by alerting users to swap events and changing token prices, as well as for V3 liquidity alerts. QuickSwap relies on Push\u2019s communication layer to deliver in-app notifications while ensuring a decentralized relay and storage.\\n\\nIn this episode of \u201cFrens of Push\u201d, Roc, Founder [@QuickSwapDEX](https://twitter.com/QuickSwapDEX), joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push and QuickSwap has the potential to disrupt web3 communication.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n### Hi Roc, what\u2019s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\\n\\n<b>Roc:</b> I\u2019ve been around the Web3 space for a long time \u2013 since the early days of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a libertarian, Bitcoin was my first love so to speak. As an elegant solution to an age-old monetary dilemma that has plagued humanity, I was on board and extremely interested right away.\\n\\nHowever, as the Web3 industry has grown and evolved around Bitcoin, my interests have evolved as well in the years since I discovered Bitcoin. Today, I see the power of decentralized systems as being capable of resolving far more problems than just sound money. The power of decentralized finance to free up dormant capital, vastly improve capital efficiency, and provide individuals across the world with a more level playing field and opportunities to invest and capitalize on their skills excites me very much.\\n\\nToday, I am leading Lunar Digital Assets (LDA), a premier marketing agency and incubator that helps rising Web3 projects to get the most out of their technology. We specialize in brand building, narrative formation, and effective marketing strategies. QuickSwap is one of our long-time clients, and we go way back with the team at Polygon Labs, too. At LDA, We see a great deal of promise in the ecosystem being developed in Polygon 2.0, and we are positioning QuickSwap to be a key player in all things Polygon DeFi. Keep an eye on us!\\n\\n### Tell us about QuickSwap \u2014 what\u2019s it about and what problem does QuickSwap solve?\\n\\n<b>Roc:</b> QuickSwap is the premier DeFi suite on Polygon, bar none. Since the infamous 2020 DeFi wave, QuickSwap has been committed to providing Web3 users of all demographics with the simplest, most intuitive user experience possible. On this accord, QuickSwap has served as an evangelizing force for Polygon\u2019s scalability stack, in the mission to drive down costs and transaction times. More recently, QuickSwap has acted as a first mover deploying on Polygon\u2019s latest high-performance chain, zkEVM as well.\\n\\nWith QuickSwap, whether you\u2019re looking to swap, stake, and farm on a lightning-fast DEX or trade high-stakes perpetual contracts, you know you\u2019re going to get the best of everything. The latest features, the slickest user experience, the lowest fees, and of course, true decentralization. Between the QuickSwap DAO\u2019s governance votes and discussions, and Polygon\u2019s decentralized architecture, users no longer have to choose between high-performance decentralized systems and user-friendly UIs \u2013 with QuickSwap, it\u2019s the best of everything, all in one place.\\n\\n### How do developers use QuickSwap?\\n\\n<b>Roc:</b> Developers are free and welcome to explore QuickSwap\u2019s documentation and to connect with the team to send in suggestions, new ideas, and business development proposals. QuickSwap has been integrating new technologies on a monthly basis for years now \u2013 not to mention integrating QuickSwap\u2019s platforms on new and rising Polygon CDK chains. For the technical folks out there, go right ahead and check out [QuickSwap\u2019s GitHub](https://github.com/QuickSwap/quickswap-docs).\\n\\n### What\u2019s the 2024 plan for QuickSwap and its ecosystem?\\n\\n<b>Roc:</b> I\u2019m glad you asked! QuickSwap released its plans for DragonFi 2.0 in December 2023, and I have to say: that the project has been delivering right on schedule. QuickSwap\u2019s DragonFi 2.0 initiative focuses on deploying the QuickSwap DeFi suite \u2013 a QuickSwap Citadel, as it\u2019s called \u2013 to as many newly arriving Polygon CDK (Chain Development Kit) chains as possible. The mission is simple: to become the dominant DeFi force on Polygon 2.0, and eventually, to conquer the entire Web3 DeFi scene as the go-to homebase for ultra-high-performance, ultra-low-cost, ultra-liquid\u2026.well, you get it.\\n\\nThis year, QuickSwap has stayed true to its word, deploying Citadels on a number of new Polygon chains, including zkAstar, Immutable zkEVM, and Manta Pacific. The movement is underway, and QuickSwap\u2019s user base and key metrics are growing every week.\\n\\n### How is QuickSwap using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\n<b>Roc:</b> At present, QuickSwap is using the Push communication layer to alert users as to swap events, and changing token prices, as well as for V3 liquidity alerts \u2013 for instance, when a user\u2019s liquidity falls out of range.\\n\\nBut there\u2019s a lot more in the works and on the way. Already, QuickSwap has plans to leverage the Push communication layer to keep users informed with a range of new notifications, including those related to perpetual contracts, limit order and TWAP limit order execution, new farm and bond deployment, and the conclusion and closure of various farming opportunities. There\u2019s a lot to look forward to in the world of QuickSwap \u2013 thanks to the whole team over at Push.\\n\\n### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\n<b>Roc:</b> Above all, Push is super user-friendly and intuitive. As a project fully committed to delivering a best-in-class user experience, QuickSwap is of the opinion that using Web3 ecosystems should be as simple as possible. Otherwise, onboarding ain\u2019t happening. On that thread, setting up notifications should be just as easy as receiving them. Thankfully, Push has absolutely nailed it in the communications department and is setting up a much-needed set of communications tooling and services.\\n\\nFor QuickSwap, that means improving user experience for traders is easier than ever before \u2013 you might call it the best user experience experience on the market!\\n\\n### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\n<b>Roc:</b> As the world continues to migrate to the on-chain domain, notifications will become absolutely necessary built-in features \u2013 especially for Layer 1 transactions that necessarily involve some degree of latency. Transaction confirmations aren\u2019t the only examples \u2013 as SocialFi expands, on-chain identity tooling picks up traction, and payment rails integrate digital assets, notifications will become essential for users to utilize decentralized systems and their native assets with confidence. Push is standing at the very frontier of digital innovation \u2013 right alongside QuickSwap, that is!\\n\\n### What is your take on the future of DeFi on Polygon and how QuickSwap plans to leverage it?\\n\\n<b>Roc:</b> In the QuickSwap community, everyone is very, very excited about the interoperable Polygon 2.0 ecosystem that is beginning to take form. Simply put, the ease of deployment provided by Polygon CDK and the immense benefits that chains and their users are reaping from unified liquidity and seamless interoperability is going to revolutionize what is possible in Web3.\\n\\nIn the Layer 2 race, QuickSwap is proud to be utilizing the next generation of rising Polygon technologies, yet again. The project invites new users, developer teams, and other enthusiasts from around the space to check out Web3\u2019s most epic scalability stack yet for themselves!\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\nThanks, Roc for the awesome conversation.

However, fostering strong communication and community engagement in these fast-paced ecosystems can be a challenge.\\n\\n[Push Protocol](https://push.org/) emerges as a game-changer, offering a secure and scalable solution for DeFi and NFT brands to connect with their user base effectively. Let\'s delve into how Push Protocol empowers these brands in two key areas: sending notifications and managing communities.\\n\\n### Seamless Notification Delivery:\\n\\nGone are the days of unreliable social media notifications and clunky email lists. Push Protocol enables DeFi and NFT brands to deliver real-time, secure notifications directly to users\' crypto wallets. This ensures critical updates, price fluctuations, governance proposals, and exclusive announcements reach your audience instantly.\\n\\n**Benefits of Push Protocol Notifications:**\\n\\n- **Increased User Engagement:**\xa0Real-time updates keep users informed and involved, fostering a more active and engaged community around your DeFi or NFT project.\\n  Think of [Lido](https://lido.fi/), broadcasting regular reward updates to its users who have staked various tokens!\\n\\n- **Improved Transparency:**\xa0Ensure users are always in the loop with critical announcements and governance proposals delivered directly to their wallets.\\n\\nFor instance, DAOs like [BitDAO](https://www.mantle.xyz/) can send any new proposal alerts staright to the voting member\'s wallet address.\\n\\n- **Enhanced User Experience:**\xa0Streamline communication by eliminating the need for users to constantly check social media or email for updates.\\n\\nDefi Protocol\'s like the [Angle Protocol](https://app.push.org/channels/0xA2dEe32662F6243dA539bf6A8613F9A9e39843D3?utm_source=Dapp&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade) leverages Push, to notify its subscriber users with periodic position status updates!\\n\\n**Here\'s how Push Protocol notifications work in action:**\\n\\n- DeFi platforms like [Aave](https://app.push.org/channels/0xAA940b3501176af328423d975C350d0d1BaAae50?utm_source=Dapp&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade) send real-time health factor warning alerts to their users, helping them avoid liquidation risks.\\n\\n- NFT marketplaces or communities can notify its users about upcoming drops or exclusive minting opportunities.\\n  Similar to the [Pudgy Penguin\'s Unstopabble Domains token gated group chat](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1777929898784444842?utm_source=google&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade) powered by Push Protocol.\\n\\nBy leveraging Push Protocol notifications, DeFi and NFT brands can create a more informed and responsive user base, ultimately leading to a stronger and more successful ecosystem.\\n\\n**Want to AMPLIFY\ud83d\udd0a your insights on Push\'s latest upgrades in areas of new Protocol features, Decentralization, and Tokenomics?

It seamlessly integrates token gating, allowing access only to holders of your specific NFT. This fosters an exclusive space for discussions and collaboration.\\n\\nBut it doesn\'t stop there!\\nPush Protocol\'s partnership with [Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz/explorer) allows you to define additional access tiers within the chat using Guild roles. Imagine VIP channels for early adopters or dedicated areas for high-volume traders.\\n\\nPlus, integration with [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) lets users join using their human-readable addresses (like **yourname.nft**) for a smooth and familiar experience. This revamped group chat empowers you to cultivate a thriving NFT community with targeted communication and a strong sense of belonging.\\n\\n![Push Chat Infographic](./image1.webp \'Easily create and manage our NFT communities with Push Chat\')\\n\\n\x3c!-- push group chat diagram --\x3e\\n\\n## Push for Web 3 Builders\\n\\n### Push Nodes & Validation:\\n\\nThe Push Network will comprise three different types of Nodes. This includes:\\n\\n- **Validator nodes** - Batching notifications into blocks, validating them, and providing all the required APIs for SDK.\\n- **Storage nodes** - Indexing notifications.\\n- **Delivery nodes** - Sending notifications to the end-user device based on his/her 0xwallet, not his/her hardware credentials.\\n\\nThe network is guarded by a smart contract to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the [**_`$PUSH`_**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ \'$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com\') token is used.\\n\\n![Push Delivery Nodes infograpic](./image2.webp \'Push Delivery Nodes\')\\n\\n\x3c!-- delivery node reused graphic --\x3e\\n\\n### Push DAO - A Decentralized Push Protocol Powerhouse:\\n\\n[Push DAO](https://gov.push.org/) is a community-run organization built by Push Protocol enthusiasts. Its goal is to scale Push Protocol\'s usage and ecosystem. Over time, it will evolve to fully govern Push Protocol\'s present and future.\\n\\n**How it Works:**\\n\\n- The DAO operates through subDAOs (sub-organizations) with specific functions:\\n  - **Business Development (BD) subDAO:**\xa0Focuses on growth initiatives for Push Protocol.\\n  - **Grants subDAO:**\xa0Manages community grants and future Push ecosystem grants.\\n  - **Push Council:**\xa0Oversees budgets for all subDAOs and the DAO itself.\\n- Anyone can propose Push Improvement Proposals (PIPs) to improve the protocol.\\n- Initiatives are voted on and implemented seasonally (monthly or quarterly).\\n\\n**The Takeaway:**\\n\\nPush DAO is a community-driven force, empowering Push Protocol\'s growth and future direction.\\n\\n## Tokenomics\\n\\n[**_`$PUSH`_**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ \'$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com\') is the native token of the Push Network and it will be used to enable several key functions of the network apart from the already existing utilities defined in the current tokenomics.\\n\\n1. **Staking for Push Validator Nodes**\\n   Push Validator Nodes are going to be the computational backbone of the Push Network. They will be responsible for validating the network and ensuring that the network is secure and reliable. They are also responsible for penalizing and kicking out bad actors from the network.\\n\\nRunning a Push Validator Node will require staking a certain amount of [**_`$PUSH`_**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ \'$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com\') tokens along with having a domain name and a server to run the node.\\n\\n2. **Staking for Push Storage Nodes**\\n   Push Storage Nodes are meant to store the data of the Push Network. They will be responsible for storing the data of the network and ensuring that the data is available to the network.\\n\\nRunning a Push Storage Node will also require staking a certain amount of [**_`$PUSH`_**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ \'$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com\').\\n\\n3. **Staking for Push Delivery Nodes**\\n   Push Delivery Nodes serve as a light node that enables the last mile delivery of notifications to the end users. Running them will also have staking requirements.\\n\\n4. **Stake for Writing API Calls on Push Node**\\n   Having a trustless and decentralized network requires a mechanism to ensure that the network is not spammed with unnecessary API calls. To ensure this, a staking mechanism requiring [**_`$PUSH`_**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ \'$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com\') will be introduced for writing API calls on the Push Network for sending notifications.\\n\\nThis is just the beginning of **Push Tokenomics V2** and we are super excited to unveil even more exciting utilities as we progress- Join the Push Fam community on [Twitter](https://x.com/PushChain) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pushprotocol) for more updates!"},{"id":"billion-reason-to-build-bootcamp-covering-every-dimension-of-the-web3-ecosystem","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/billion-reason-to-build-bootcamp-covering-every-dimension-of-the-web3-ecosystem","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-01-billion-reason-to-build-bootcamp/index.md","title":"Billion Reasons to Build Bootcamp: Covering Every Dimension of the Web3 Ecosystem","description":"Billion Reasons to Build Bootcamp: Covering Every Dimension of the Web3 Ecosystem","date":"2024-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 1, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"},{"label":"BRB","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/brb"}],"readingTime":1.4666666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"billion-reason-to-build-bootcamp-covering-every-dimension-of-the-web3-ecosystem","title":"Billion Reasons to Build Bootcamp: Covering Every Dimension of the Web3 Ecosystem","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Billion Reasons to Build Bootcamp: Covering Every Dimension of the Web3 Ecosystem","text":"BRB was initiated with a vision to solve the 1 HARD problem with the first step taken in 2023 by traveling to 18 cities where amazing minds come together to learn and build with a chance to win over $50,000 in prizes!","tags":["Push Protocol","Web3","Blockchain Technology","BRB"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":" Introducing Push Amplify Upgrade!

We achieved some significant milestones that we\u2019re excited to share with you.\\n\\nWe sent out over 4 million notifications and reached 174,000 subscribers. But our journey doesn\u2019t stop here. Let\u2019s dive into the exciting updates for March from the Push Ecosystem:\\n\\n### Partnership Updates\\n\\nWe\u2019ve seen a surge in clients integrating our notifications and messaging services. Some of our notable partners include [Verso Wallet](https://get-verso.com/), [DEXYNTH](https://www.dexynth.com/), [Outposts](https://outposts.io/), [Bitget](https://twitter.com/bitgetglobal), [AlphaX](https://alphax.finance/), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.foundation/), [RoseonX](https://roseon.world/), and many more. They\u2019ve all integrated Push notifications and chat into their platforms.\\n\\nIn addition, we partnered with the [LearnWeb3IO](https://learnweb3.io/) hackathon to support future builders.\\n\\n### Product Enhancements\\n\\nWe introduced the Push [MetaMask Snooze Snap](https://app.push.org/?/snap), which allows users to snooze notifications for up to 72 hours. This feature helps users manage their notifications at their own pace.We introduced a \'guest\' mode on our dApp, making it easier than ever to explore Push without connecting your wallet\\n\\nWe also benchmarked our [Push Chat Architecture](https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message/) to make Push Chat work more efficiently. We launched the [Price Tracker Channel](https://www.notion.so/Push-x-Berachain-Spaces-Creative-Changes-5756710613b74055baa39ba4d534fe33?pvs=21) to help users get notified directly when their chosen cryptocurrency hits their desired price target.\\n\\n### Community Engagement\\n\\nWe\u2019ve been actively engaging with our vibrant community through various initiatives. We hosted a demo session for Push Nodes and awarded Push Alpha access NFT to over 700 users.\\n\\nOur \u201cDecentralize with Push Campaign\u201d led to the acquisition of more than 4,200 new users. We also unveiled [Tokenomics V2](https://push.org/blog/push-tokenomics-v2-engine/) for the $PUSH token.\\n\\nTo celebrate the listing of the $PUSH token on the Bitget Global exchange, we ran a quest campaign. We also announced the ultra-rare role \u201cPush Chad\u201d for our community.\\n\\n### Ecosystem Highlights\\n\\nIn March, we featured ETH Gas Price Tracker, [CryptoJobsList](https://cryptojobslist.com/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), and [Bankless](https://www.bankless.com/) as the Push Channel of the Week.\\n\\n### DAO\\n\\nWe launched the Push Grants V3 initiative to support builders in the Push Ecosystem. We also welcomed [Ian](https://twitter.com/ExpatCrypto3) as our new DAO Relations Lead and [Carla](https://twitter.com/carlaupgrade) as our Community DAO Relations role for push_dao.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019ve made and look forward to what the future holds for the Push Ecosystem.

An all-new decentralized infrastructure for web3\u2019s leading communication layer, the Push Protocol Network.\\n\\nThis new and improved decentralized infrastructure for Push is a long-awaited move that we\u2019re only now executing thanks to extensive research and development.\\n\\nSo what does this new decentralized infrastructure look like?\\n\\nIn this article, we\'ll explore:\\n\\n- What is decentralization in web3 and how will the new Push Network look\\n- Exploring types of nodes and explanation of Push Nodes\\n- Why is it necessary\\n\\n### Understanding Different Types of Decentralization - Which Will Push Become\\n\\nDecentralization can mean different things depending who you ask because it is a very complex topic that can exist in many different forms and structures. This is why many modern blockchains and protocols have tight discussions on what it means to be fully decentralized.\\n\\nSo to begin with, we\u2019ll explore the different types of architecture at a high level as a way of best communicating what Push is working towards\\n\\nClient-Server \u2013 Linear system <br />\\nDistributed \u2013 Different nodes hold different responsibilities and contribute to one another <br />\\nPeer-toPeer \u2013 Data is passed directly from user to user with no intermediaries<br />\\nDecentralized \u2013 Collective and shared control over data and decision making<br />\\n\\n![First Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nAs we\u2019ve outlined in the image above, Push is moving towards the right. A fully decentralized network wherein no single node or entity has complete control of the network. Access is open and shared.\\n\\nKeep in mind, decentralization can also be applied at different layers of an organization. Just as you can decentralize software architecture, you too can decentralize teams and organizational structures (DAOs).\\n\\nWhile the Push Network already has a DAO and $PUSH token, we are now taking the final step towards decentralization by decentralizing our software architecture, completing what you might call \u2018full stack decentralization\u2019.\\n\\nOur goal is to build a permissionless, trustless, proof-of-stake protocol with different node types that provide a decentralized API for notifications processing, indexing, and delivery. Ultimately, we\u2019re aiming to wrap the whole system in a developer-friendly SDK package and a dApp that can leverage the power of this network.\\n\\n### Push Nodes As The Key: How Do They Work\\n\\nThe Push Network will comprise three different types of Nodes. This includes:\\n\\n- Validator nodes - Batching notifications into blocks, validating them, and providing all the required APIs for SDK\\n- Storage nodes - Indexing notifications\\n- Delivery nodes - Sending notifications to the end-user device based on his/her 0xwallet, not his/her hardware credentials.\\n\\nThe network is guarded by a smart contract to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the PUSH token is used.\\n\\nIn our proposed architecture, the storage network is sharded by a smart contract, which assigns specific shards to specific nodes to ensure a high amount of redundancy. This is done on top of storage nodes.\\n\\nWe\u2019re targeting fast delivery of ~15s on average for delivery of Notifications.\\n\\nAbstract architecture\\n\\n![Second Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nThe basic use-case:\\n\\nA javascript SDK locates the right validator, posts a notification, and this notification will be included in the block. The block list of validator nodes for processing is determined by a combined network random number (randao).\\n\\nA more detailed version of the architecture looks like this:\\n\\n![Third Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know](./image-3.webp)\\n\\nWe\u2019ll now explore each of the three Node types in more detail.\\n\\n#### Validator Nodes\\n\\nEvery validator can be slashed, in case his vote on the new block differs from the majority of their validators, which voted for the block as valid.\\n\\n![Fourth Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know](./image-4.webp)\\n\\n#### Storage nodes\\n\\nOriginally, Push Storage Nodes validate and index all communications and link them to a user\u2019s wallet address and multi-chain identity.\\n\\nThe new Push decentralized system maps every wallet notification data to a specific shard.\\n\\nThis shard maintains X copies in the network. The smart contract dynamically computes x.\\nWhenever new nodes join, the contract recomputes which storage nodes are assigned to which shards.\\n\\n![Fifth Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know](./image-5.webp)\\n\\n![Sixth Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know](./image-6.webp)\\n\\n#### Delivery Nodes\\n\\nDelivery nodes are a pivotal component of the decentralized Push Notification infrastructure. They ensure notifications are securely and efficiently delivered to the end-user\u2019s device while serving as a decentralized solution for connecting web3 and web2. These nodes can be hosted by trusted third parties, bringing reliability and professionalism to the system. Their operation hinges on a few key principles and functionalities:\\n\\n- <b>Integration with Established APIs</b>: To leverage robust, widely-accepted infrastructure for sending Push Notifications.\\n- <b>Privacy-Centric Mapping</b>: To maintain the privacy and security of the users, delivery nodes store a mapping between a registered crypto wallet and the end-user device ID.\\n- <b>Hosting by Trusted Entities</b>: Recognizing the importance of reliability and trust in the notification delivery process, delivery nodes can be hosted by trusted third parties.\\n- <b>Collaboration with Wallet Providers</b>: In addition to being hosted by trusted third parties, delivery nodes can also be hosted by wallet providers themselves. This collaboration brings an added layer of integration and convenience, as wallet providers have a direct interest in ensuring that their users receive notifications promptly and securely.\\n\\n![Seventh Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know](./image-7.webp)\\n\\n#### Why Push Nodes? Why Decentralization?\\n\\nYou can read more about Push Delivery Nodes [here](https://push.org/blog/empower-your-wallet-app-or-platform-with-push-delivery-nodes/).\\n\\nWe believe that communication tools should be a public good. Builders should have open and free access to enhance their dApps with web3-native communication, without needing to rely on centralized providers.\\n\\nAs an extension of this, those same builders should not just have access to these tools, but a say in how these tools get developed and improved over time.\\n\\nAs the accessibility of these tools grows, so does the quality of dApps that build with them. When we achieve the goal of building better projects, we move closer towards a reality where we can onboard the next billion users to web3.\\n\\nWe are excited for this new era for the Push Protocol Network and we are extremely excited to have you be a part of it.\\n\\nFor more questions or queries, join us in Discord \ud83d\udc49https://discord.com/invite/pushprotocol\\n\\nYou can also get started building with Push tools \ud83d\udc49https://comms.push.org/docs/"},{"id":"benchmarking-push-chat-message","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-04-benchmarking-push-chat-message-architecture/index.md","title":"Benchmarking Push Chat Message Architecture: What Changed? \ud83d\udcac \u26a1","description":"Benchmarking Push Chat Message Architecture: What Changed? \ud83d\udcac \u26a1","date":"2024-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 4, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"},{"label":"EthGlobal","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/eth-global"}],"readingTime":5.5633333333333335,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"benchmarking-push-chat-message","title":"Benchmarking Push Chat Message Architecture: What Changed? \ud83d\udcac \u26a1","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Benchmarking Push Chat Message Architecture: What Changed? \ud83d\udcac \u26a1","text":"Push Chat has been a game-changer for  web3 messaging, offering a hassle-free experience for user to user, user to dApp, and group conversations.

Essentially, Push Chat bridges the gap between messaging in web3 and web2, offering a hassle-free transition. One pivotal enhancement we\'ve diligently pursued within Push Chat involves reconfiguring the architecture for storing and retrieving messages, resulting in significantly faster performance.\\n\\nWhether you\'re engaging in public group chats, participating in private discussions, or accessing token-gated communities, Push Group Chat simplifies and secures connections. Now, Push is elevating its scalability and drastically improving message transmission speeds.\\n\\n### Understanding Push Chat Message Architecture\\n\\n#### V1 Architecture\\n\\nIn the earlier iteration of Push Chat, messages were managed within a linked list structure. This architecture employed references where each message pointed to the previous one, creating a sequential chain of messages. However, this design encountered some significant hurdles.\\n\\nOne notable issue arose from the concurrent arrival of messages, as the linked list format struggled to handle the concurrent processing of incoming messages. This concurrency bottleneck often resulted in performance degradation and dropping of messages by Push nodes, undermining the real-time nature of Push Chat.\\n\\nMoreover, the process of retrieving messages from this linked list structure posed its own set of challenges. Since Push nodes primarily stored references to the latest message, retrieving older messages required traversing the entire linked list sequentially. This approach led to slow query speeds, as resolving previous messages necessitated the resolution of the current message first.\\n\\n#### V2 Architecture\\n\\nIn the latest iteration, Push Chat has undergone a significant architectural transformation, one of the most notable changes in v2 is the abandonment of the linked list paradigm, where each message no longer references the previous one.\\n\\nBy eliminating the requirement for messages to reference the previous one, v2 architecture significantly simplifies message processing, enabling Push nodes to handle concurrent messages more efficiently. This architectural shift has alleviated the concurrency bottleneck that plagued the earlier version, enhancing the scalability and responsiveness of Push Chat.\\n\\nFurthermore, in v2, Push nodes now cache every message instead of solely storing references to the latest message hash. This strategic enhancement plays a pivotal role in optimizing message retrieval speeds. By caching every message, Push nodes can swiftly access and deliver messages upon request, mitigating the latency issues associated with sequential message resolution.\\n\\nIt\'s worth noting that despite these architectural changes, the fundamental immutable layer of Push Chat remains rooted in IPFS. Every message, whether in v1 or v2, continues to be backed up by a client-signed and verifiable verification proof. This cryptographic mechanism ensures the integrity and authenticity of messages, safeguarding them against tampering or unauthorized alterations.\\n\\n### Push Chat Benchmarks: Letting The Numbers Speak For Unprecedented Scale And Security\\n\\n> Note:: It\'s important to acknowledge that the benchmarking of v2 architecture was conducted on a development server, while the benchmarking of v1 architecture took place on a production server. It\'s worth highlighting that the production server possesses 16 times more CPU power than the development server, potentially providing an unfair advantage to v1 architecture. Additionally, it\'s crucial to recognize that the traffic volume on the production server is substantially higher compared to the development environment. These discrepancies in server specifications and traffic levels should be considered when interpreting the benchmark results.\\n\\n#### List Paginated User Chats\\n\\nFn Breakdown\\n\\n1.

Push Nodes are the nodes responsible for validating notification and chat payload and for dispatching notifications to addresses. Push Nodes can have different roles in this Communication Network.\\nThe vision for Push Protocol is for the Push Nodes to be run by the community and to get rewarded by contributing to the network\'s decentralization. As of today, Push Nodes are run by Push Protocol, but the team is working on decentralizing the nodes.\\nAlthough the Push Nodes are run by Push Protocol, users can always verify that the chat messages and notifications haven\u2019t been tampered with and that they have indeed been sent by the correct address. Users can always verify this by the Verification Proof.\\n\\nHead over to the [Galxe](https://galxe.com/JDGNdt7oWLFDeUUUVgdNmb/campaign/GCsdpt4Jjk) quest page now and embark on your journey."},{"id":"monthly-recap-january-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/monthly-recap-january-2024","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-08-monthly-recap-january-2024/index.md","title":"Monthly Recap January \ud83c\udf89","description":"Monthly Recap January \ud83c\udf89","date":"2024-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 8, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"}],"readingTime":1.8433333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"monthly-recap-january-2024","title":"Monthly Recap January \ud83c\udf89","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Monthly Recap January \ud83c\udf89","text":"Welcome to this last month\'s highlights and fresh product launches!

Here\u2019s everything we got up to:\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nMost notably we launched our [Community Based Messaging](https://push.org/blog/announcing-group-chat-from-push-unstoppable/) feature for Group Chats directly on Unstoppable Domains! With this collaboration, every \u2018badge\u2019 (NFTs assigned to wallets based on wallet holder status/activity history) will have its own Group Chat. Holding badges allow you to access the respective Group Chat. [Try it out for yourself!](https://unstoppabledomains.com/)\\n\\nWe also launched our [Live Push Roadmap for 2024](https://comms.push.org/docs/roadmap/). It\u2019s an all-new way to track and follow along with all of our planned developments for the year. Spoiler, there is no shortage of exciting developments to come. We\u2019ll be launching Push Nodes (our final hurdle to achieve full scale decentralization) as well as new MetaMask Snap enhancements.\\n\\n### Frens of Push\\n\\nPush added several new and exciting partners to its ecosystem in January.\\n\\n1. [Cookie3](https://twitter.com/cookie3_co): We\u2019re working towards offering targeted user notification segmentation like never before using on-chain data.\\n2.

Today, the launch of the token-gated Group Chat on the UD messaging platform is another step towards decentralized, open, censorship-resistant communication for the future of the web. At launch, UD Group messaging will go live with <b>400+ Groups, for 3.8M+ UD users</b>.\\n\\n### Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication\\n\\nCurrently, UD\u2019s messaging interface [Unstoppable Messaging](https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/categories/announcements/article/messaging-launch) allows any web3 user to message addresses belonging to a .eth, .x, .crypto domain, .polygon along with many other domains. However, Unstoppable Messaging has been limited to just one-to-one and one-to-many messaging. As such, we\u2019ve been working with Unstoppable Domains to enable a robust, token-gated system through badges, allowing anyone with a [badge](https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001215751-badges) to join a Group Chat and start a conversation.\\n\\nBy blending UD\u2019s expertise in web3 domain services with Push Protocol\u2019s market-leading decentralized messaging technology, we\u2019re excited to release this all-new feature to the web3 community.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n    <i>\\n    \u201cOur partnership with Unstoppable is not merely about changing the way teams communicate; it\'s about revolutionizing it. \'Group Chat\' embodies our dedication to empowering organizations with cutting-edge communication technology.\\" \\n    </i>\\n    <b>\u2014 Harsh Rajat, Founder at Push Protocol</b>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n### What Are Token Gated Group Chats\\n\\nToken-gated Group Chats are exactly what their name implies, Group Chats that require you to hold a specific token (NFT or crypto-asset) to either access any given group, or message within it. Token-gating your Group Chats is a surefire way of controlling who can enter your chats and who can message within them. As the admin of your Group Chat, you can set and adjust permissions whenever you like.\\n\\nFor businesses, organizations, and teams, it\u2019s a fantastic way to ensure your communication channels remain private and secure by giving you total control over who enters and participates in the communication channel.\\n\\nYou can learn more about [Token-Gated/Conditional Group Chats here](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/build/conditional-rules-for-group/).\\n\\n### Getting Started With UD Group Chat\\n\\nGetting started with Push Protocol x Unstoppable Domains Group Chat is simple \u2014 you either need to join an existing Group Chat or create your own.\\n\\nEvery Group Chat is associated with a \u2018[badge](https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001215751-badges)\u2019 and hence token-gated based on badge ownership.\\n\\nAt launch, every UD badge that exists will have its own Group Chat (currently 400+ Group Chats are live). If you\u2019re a holder of those badges, you\u2019ll be eligible to join those groups.\\n\\n- To join a Group Chat for a badge you own:\\n\\n1. Go to Unstoppable Messaging from your [ud.me](https://ud.me/) Profile ([Learn More](https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001244742-unstoppable-messaging)).\\n2.

The mission of the campaign was simple \u2013 to provide developers the opportunity to create real-world impact by giving them a hard problem to solve from leading protocols. This of course included rewards.\\n\\nTo create a variety of challenges, we teamed up with 12 of the most prominent protocols in web3 including Ethereum Foundation, ETHGlobal, Polygon, Filecoin, The Graph, Aragon, Timeswap, Alchemy, Shardeum, Flipkart, Biconomy, and Chainsafe to create a running hackathon.\\n\\nEach partner in the BRB hackathon presented their own unique Coding Challenge \u2013 a complex problem with a substantial bounty for the builder who could solve it.\\n\\nToday, we\'re thrilled to announce that 2 of these Coding Challenges have been solved!\\n\\nHere are the 2 challenges, the importance behind each of them, and the masterminds behind the game-changing solutions.\\n\\n### Quantum-proofing Ethereum Network \u2013 solved by Aditya Bisht\\n\\nCoding Challenge Owner: [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/)\\n\\nChallenge: Figure out a way to quantum-proof the Ethereum Network, read more [here](https://www.notion.so/pushprotocol/Ethereum-Foundation-07179dcf7f7e44efb7d2b2c9d2296264?pvs=4)\\n\\nWinning Builder: [Aditya Bisht](https://twitter.com/bisht__13)\\n\\nQuantum computing is a looming threat to blockchain networks. Its powerful computing capabilities mean it can be used to reverse-engineer secret keys from public keys. To retain security and integrity in the Ethereum Network, the challenge was presented to find a way to quantum-proof the network using account abstraction.\\n\\nWe\u2019d like to congratulate <b>Aditya Bisht</b> for successfully solving the challenge and contributing to the security and robustness of the Ethereum Network.\\n\\nHe shared his excitement with us \u2013 \u201cFaced with intriguing complexities and the convergence of overlapping domains, the challenge not only pushed the boundaries but also contributed to advancing the ZK domain. Immense gratitude to the mentors from the Ethereum foundation and the unwavering support from Push. This victory is a testament to the collaborative spirit propelling the Ethereum project forward.\u201d \u2013 Aditya\\n\\n### All-new DAO Permissions \u2013 solved by Samuel Mens\\n\\nCoding Challenge Owner: [Aragon](https://aragon.org/)\\n\\nChallenge: Create a permission management protocol for allocating selective permissions to specific individuals and subDAOs, read more [here](https://www.notion.so/pushprotocol/Aragon-f5467edc3c2a4f8d9d5693a0a6e680de?pvs=4).\\n\\nWinning Builder: [Samuel Mens](http://@plopmenz)\\n\\nDAOs and organizations rely on being able to give certain permissions, roles, and responsibilities to specific individuals and teams (subDAOs) in order to build more efficiently. But keeping track of which wallets have which permissions can be confusing, not to mention how easy it is to lose track of these permissions across a single DAO. As such, the problem statement required a builder to find a way that enables a DAO to efficiently manage permissions.\\n\\nWith that, we\u2019d like to congratulate Samuel Mens who built two plugins and a UI that allow you to manage both subDAOs and NFT-based permissions using [@hatsprotocol](https://twitter.com/hatsprotocol) and Aragon OSx. For all DAOs that are built using Aragon, there is now a whole new level of on-chain governance management tools available.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n    <i>\\n    \\"I\'ve been part of the Aragon community since their launch of OSx and have built several plugins. I had this idea for a pretty ambitious plugin, which alligned very well with the BRB Hackathon bounty. I am very grateful for Push Protocol for providing this opportunity, giving me the motivation to actually built it and go the extra mile.\\"\\n    </i>\\n    <div>\\n    \u2013 Samuel Mens\\n    </div>\\n </blockquote>\\n\\n### Meet the winners on Jan 16th\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to host a Twitter Space on Jan 16th, 3PM UTC to talk to our partners and winners of the phase-1 and learn more about their journey and experiences. Don\u2019t forget to join us for the [Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1lPKqbWRgvEGb).\\n\\n### BRB Goes Online With 9 Challenges Still Available To Solve\\n\\nThanks to the incredible success of the BRB so far, we are excited to announce the extension of the initiative. We\u2019re calling it <b>BRB Online</b>. This online campaign will mean the BRB Coding Challenges will continue to run indefinitely until solved, allowing more developers worldwide to build for and collaborate with leading web3 projects.\\n\\nBe sure to check out the remaining Coding Challenges here \ud83d\udc49https://push.org/brb/\\n\\nRicha Joshi, Co-founder at Push Protocol, shared her excitement:\\n\\n<blockquote><i>\u201cThe success of BRB has inspired us to take the initiative online. Developers worldwide can now continually access BRB challenges and collaborate directly with some of web3\u2019s leading projects.\u201d</i></blockquote>\\n\\nWe are extremely proud to support the BRB winners and look forward to announcing the winners of all the remaining partner challenges.

It\'s time to recap what we achieved, impact it made and where we are headed next!\\n\\n2023 was amazing for Push as we launched the products and features we\'ve been working on to provide a full web3 communication stack for developers, businesses and users. Let\'s dive into the details of what all we achieved in 2023.\\n\\nimport ReactPlayer from \\"react-player\\";\\nimport { ABlock } from \\"@site/src/css/SharedStyling\\";\\n\\n## Push by Numbers\\n\\nPush has grown tremendously in 2023, we saw an increase in notifications sent (+50 Million YTD) and subscribers (154k). Our ecosystem expanded as more protocols started using Push to send notifications / chat to their users across chains. Push is now live on 5 chains including Ethereum, Polygon zKEVM, PoS, Arbitrum and BNB.\\n\\n![Notification data for Push Protocol growth](./subscribers2023.png)\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n### Unified Push SDK\\n\\nPush launched a unified SDK for web3 developers to send [**notifications**](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications \'Explore Push Notifications Protocol\') or [**chats**](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat \'Explore Push Chat Protocol\') to their users with unification of the SDK, with **video** and **spaces** support coming soon!\\n\\nThis enabled Push API class that is common for all suite of products by Push enabling developers to use Push products with ease. It also paved the way for Push to heavily abstract away the complexities of web3 communication and provide a seamless experience to developers.\\n\\n<ABlock href=\\"https://comms.push.org/docs/\\" title=\\"Developer documentation hub\\">Learn all about the Unified Push SDK from Push Documentation Hub</ABlock>\\n\\n### Push x MetaMask Snap\\n\\nPush started with the vision of enabling seamless communication for web3, launching Snaps for 30 Million users of MetaMask was a big step towards that vision as it allows users to have their communication delivered to them right on their MetaMask wallet.\\n\\nWe are excited to share that web3 notifications sent by protocols using Push are now delivered to users on MetaMask. If you are a web3 builder, then re-engagement is a big problem for you which get\'s solved by implementing [web3 notifications with Push now!](https://comms.push.org/docs/ \'Explore Push Docs\')\\n\\n<ReactPlayer\\n  controls\\n  width=\\"100%\\"\\n  url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjPxKoYLiGs\\"\\n/>\\n\\n<ABlock href=\\"/blog/bringing-push-to-meta-mask-snaps/\\" title=\\"Tutorial on how to get started with Push x Metamask snap\\">Get started with Push x Metamask snap</ABlock>\\n\\n### Push x Unstoppable\\n\\nOur partner [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/ \'Push x Unstoppable\') launched notifications and group chats for their 3.8 Million users using Push making Push Unstoppable :). Their mobile app also uses Push to send notifications to their users.\\n\\n![Preview of how Push is getting used by Unstoppable](./poweredbypush2.png)\\n\\nWhat\'s more, UD have open sourced their code for the community to use and contribute to. Check the repo out [here](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/domain-profiles/tree/main/packages/ui-components/src/components/Chat \'Push x Unstoppable Repo\') / [staging demo](https://staging.ud.me/examples/unstoppable-messaging).\\n\\n<ABlock href=\\"/blog/business-to-user-messaging-push-protocol-x-unstoppable-domains/\\" title=\\"Business to User messaging via Unstoppable x Push\\">Business to User messaging via Unstoppable x Push</ABlock>\\n\\n### Gated + Group Chats\\n\\nPush launched gated chats for web3 protocols to enable them to create gated communities for their users. This enables protocols / DAOs / NFTs to create a community of their users and engage with them based on the gamification of their choice.\\n\\nFor example: You can gate a group chat for users who hold a certain NFT or have a certain amount of tokens in their wallet or you can gate sending messages in a group chat based on the amount of tokens a user holds. Even custom logic of your choice or web2 logic can be used to gate a group chat paving new token utility use cases for your protocol.\\n\\n<ABlock href=\\"https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/build/conditional-rules-for-group/\\" title=\\"Dev docs explaining how to condional gate a group\\">Developer guide to conditional gating groups</ABlock>\\n\\n### Hyper-scalable Groups\\n\\nPush launched hyper-scalable groups allowing upto 5k users for private and 25k users for public groups. This enables protocols to create large communities of their users and engage with them in a seamless manner. This is a big deal! Web2 chat apps like Whatsapp or Signal are only able to support upto 1k users!\\n\\nFor the first time, Web3 messaging is coming at par with and beating most Web2 messaging apps in terms of scalability but with the added benefit of being immutable, permissionless and containing web3 native functionalities.\\n\\n<ABlock href=\\"/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats/\\" title=\\"Article about hyper scalable group chat of Push\\">Benchmark article on hyperscalable group chats</ABlock>\\n\\n### Frontend Components\\n\\nPush launched frontend components for web3 developers to easily integrate Push products into their web3 dapps. Enough talk, let\'s see it in action\\n\\n```jsx live\\n// customPropMinimized=\'true\'\\nimport { ChatUIProvider, ChatView } from @pushprotocol/uiweb;\\n\\nfunction App(props) {\\n  return (\\n    <>\\n      <h2>\\n        Live chat with pushai.eth, connect your wallet and chat to get sassy\\n        response from PushAI.eth\\n      </h2>\\n      <div style={{ height: \'50vh\', margin: \'20px auto\' }}>\\n        <ChatUIProvider>\\n          <ChatView\\n            chatId=\'0x99A08ac6254dcf7ccc37CeC662aeba8eFA666666\'\\n            limit={10}\\n            isConnected={true}\\n            onVerificationFail={() => setShowFaucet(true)}\\n            verificationFailModalPosition={MODAL_POSITION_TYPE.RELATIVE}\\n          />\\n        </ChatUIProvider>\\n      </div>\\n    </>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<ABlock href=\\"https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/ui-components/integrate-push-chat/\\" title=\\"Developer docs on how to integrate Push Chat\\">Developer docs showing how to integrate Push Chat in 2 LOCs</ABlock>\\n\\n### Notification Settings\\n\\nNotifications for web3 are synonymous with Push. Our partners wanted to have a way to enable their users to control their notification settings on what they exactly wanted. Notifications settings is the answer to that, allowing users to control their notification settings on a granular level.\\n\\n<ABlock href=\\"/blog/introducing-notification-settings/\\" title=\\"Article explaining notification settings for Push Protocol and how to enable it\\">Notification settings and why it\'s a game changer!</ABlock>\\n\\n### Push Spaces\\n\\nPush Spaces enable several users to have audio call like experience with each other, all from the comfort of your web3 wallet! It borrows scalability and gated functionality from Push Chat protol enabling new and creative ways by which all of Web3 can interact with each other.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer\\n  controls\\n  width=\\"100%\\"\\n  url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK6wx1wJ66A\\"\\n/>\\n\\n<ABlock href=\\"/blog/push-spaces-is-live-decentralized-audio-and-video-streaming-is-here/\\" title=\\"Introduction to Push Spaces\\">Learn more about Push Spaces!</ABlock>\\n\\n### Push Video\\n\\nPush vision is to become the de-facto communication stack for web3. Real time communication like Video and Spaces was something we always planned as the next primitive to build on top of Push, as per the [whitepaper 1.0](https://whitepaper.push.org/protocol-specs-section/future-features-research \'Whitepaper talking about Push Video\').\\n\\nThe team delivered on this promise as well but with some added benefites! Since it\'s built on top of the composable standard of Push Chat and Notification protocol, it benefits from their architecture, utilizing notifications for having a facetime call like interface and group chat for enabling gated calls.\\n\\n<ABlock href=\\"/blog/push-launches-wallet-to-wallet-video-chat/\\" title=\\"Introduction to Wallet to Wallet video calls\\">Dive into Push Video and what it enables for web3 communication!</ABlock>\\n\\n### Push Protocol V2 (& Push Fee Pool!)\\n\\nPush Protocol V2 introduced the ability to do incentivized chat along with establishing the fee pool for Push Protocol.

In essence, Push Chat makes messaging in web3 as seamless as it is in web2. One feature we\u2019ve been working on extensively within Push Chat is Push Group Chat, the ability to host conversations with multiple members.\\n\\nWhether you\'re chatting in public groups, enjoying more private discussions, or joining token-gated communities, Push Group Chat makes connecting with others simple and secure. But now, Push is levelling up its scalability and increasing group limits into the thousands. Let\'s dive into the enhanced possibilities and expanded horizons that await this enhanced Push Group Chat!\\n\\n### From 1.5k to 25k Members in a Single Group Chat! \ud83d\udd25\\n\\nGroup Chat platforms have always struggled with the number of participants a single group could accommodate. This limitation has hindered the potential for large-scale user interactions and hence restricted how Group Chats can be used to connect with a broader audience. Introducing our newly enhanced Push Group Chat. We\u2019re calling it \\"hyper scalable\\" in reference to Push Group Chat\u2019s newfound ability to handle significantly larger group sizes, transcending its prior limitations. This enhancement signifies a major development for web3-native user interactions , empowering users to engage in more extensive and inclusive group conversations like never before.\\n\\nWith hyper scalability, Push Group Chat has transformed the landscape of group conversations. Public group limits have skyrocketed from 1500 to an impressive 25,000 members. Similarly, private groups once capped at 50 members, now support up to 5,000 participants. These substantial increases are redefining the potential for group interactions in web3 and reflect Push Group Chat\'s commitment to delivering a more dynamic and accommodating messaging experience.\\n\\n### Push Chat Challenging Web2 Incumbents\\n\\nInstant communication has long been dominated by traditional Web2 chat applications like WhatsApp and Signal, but Push Chat is here to challenge that. While the incumbents rely on centralised architectures that leave user data susceptible to potential vulnerabilities, Push Chat pioneers a decentralised approach, ensuring end-to-end encryption and placing control back into the hands of users.\\n\\nMoreover, the introduction of hyper scalability in Push Chat takes the competitive edge to new heights. In contrast to the confined group sizes enforced by WhatsApp and Signal, where limitations are approximately 1000 members, Push Chat shatters these constraints by accommodating a staggering 25k members for public groups and 5k for private groups.\\n\\n### Push Chat Benchmarks: Letting The Numbers Speak For Unprecedented Scale And Security\\n\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n    <th>\\n    Public Group Size\\n    </th>\\n    <th>\\n    Time Taken for Sending Message ( ms )\\n    </th>\\n\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n    <td>10</td>\\n    <td>192</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>50</td>\\n   <td>170</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>100</td>\\n   <td>110</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>250</td>\\n   <td>103</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>500</td>\\n   <td>104</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>1K</td>\\n   <td>107</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>2.5K</td>\\n   <td>117</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>5K</td>\\n   <td>167</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>10K</td>\\n   <td>156</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n   <td>15K</td>\\n   <td>198</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n   <td>25K</td>\\n   <td>343</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n    <th>\\n    Public Group Size\\n    </th>\\n    <th>\\n    Time Taken for Joining Grp ( ms )\\n    </th>\\n\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n    <td>10</td>\\n    <td>101</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>50</td>\\n   <td>111</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>100</td>\\n   <td>128</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>250</td>\\n   <td>125</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>500</td>\\n   <td>199</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>1K</td>\\n   <td>190</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>2.5K</td>\\n   <td>328</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>5K</td>\\n   <td>449</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>10K</td>\\n   <td>609</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n   <td>15K</td>\\n   <td>803</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n   <td>25K</td>\\n   <td>1109</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n    <th>\\n    Private Group Size\\n    </th>\\n    <th>\\n    Time Taken for Sending Message ( ms )\\n    </th>\\n\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n    <td>10</td>\\n    <td>300</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>50</td>\\n   <td>170</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>100</td>\\n   <td>169</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>250</td>\\n   <td>193</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>500</td>\\n   <td>231</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>1K</td>\\n   <td>295</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>2.5K</td>\\n   <td>539</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>5K</td>\\n   <td>868</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n    <th>\\n    Private Group Size\\n    </th>\\n    <th>\\n    Time Taken for Joining Grp ( ms )\\n    </th>\\n\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n    <td>10</td>\\n    <td>287</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>50</td>\\n   <td>312</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>100</td>\\n   <td>312</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>250</td>\\n   <td>481</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>500</td>\\n   <td>711</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>1K</td>\\n   <td>1192</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>2.5K</td>\\n   <td>5153</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n   <td>5K</td>\\n   <td>12769</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n### What\u2019s Made Hyper Scalability Possible?\\n\\nIn the relentless pursuit of hyper scalability, Push Chat has had to undergo transformational advancements at both the architectural and encryption levels.\\n\\nPreviously, each message within private groups underwent encryption using the private keys of all group members, resulting in encryption complexity directly proportional to the number of participants.\\n\\nContrastingly, the platform has been upgraded to now dynamically generate session keys and encrypted secrets during every pivotal group state change, such as adding, removing, or joining members. Push Chat ensures that the time-consuming aspect of the encryption process is reserved for moments when the group dynamic undergoes significant transformations. This innovative approach ensures that the encryption process for private group messages remains constant, irrespective of the group\'s size. By dissociating encryption complexity from the number of participants, Push Chat has effectively eliminated the scalability concerns associated with larger private groups.\\n\\n### But Wait\u2026More Enhancements Are On The Way!\\n\\nWe are not stopping at 5k members. We have already made the breakthrough to take this to <b>100,000</b> benchmarked members \ud83d\ude31 for both private and public group chats. The only caveat is that it breaks backward compatibility when messages using the newer architecture are read by older SDKs.\\n\\nTo address this, we have decided to implement these changes in two phases:\\nIncorporate all functionalities that understand the new architecture in Push SDK from 1.4.45 upwards. Devs just need to update to start supporting the reading of those formats.\\nThe use of the feature flags in the SDK (See below or ask on Discord as to how to enable that: https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) enables the new standard as the default allowing devs to tap into it and use that in case they want.\\n\\nSo, what do you have to do to update this functionality?\\n\\nOnly one thing: Update the SDK to the latest version (1.4.45 or upwards), that\u2019s it! This will ensure that messages sent using the new message standards are understood and displayed correctly in your dApp / mobile app / etc.\\n\\n#### How to enable Push SDK Feature Flag\\n\\nIn-depth details for how to enable this can be found in the [Push Chat documentation](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-sdk/tree/main/packages/restapi).\\n\\n### Push SDK V2 is Coming\\n\\nWe are also thrilled to announce that we are working on the V2 version of the SDK which will ensure a standardized Push user class that enables unified access to notifications, chat, video, spaces, and more!\\n\\nApart from this, the V2 version will have more streamlined response objects and faster calls though it will break backward compatibility which is why we will transition slowly to the new SDK.\\n\\nWe recommend joining our Discord server (https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) -> #dev-announcements channel for information on how to upgrade / best practices / changelog."},{"id":"push-ethIndia-push-bounties","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-ethIndia-push-bounties","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-06-push-ethIndia-push-bounties/index.md","title":"Push x ETHIndia - $10k Push Bounties + IRL Workshop \ud83d\udd14","description":"Push x ETHIndia - $10k Push Bounties + IRL Workshop \ud83d\udd14","date":"2023-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 6, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"},{"label":"EthGlobal","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/eth-global"}],"readingTime":2.9566666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-ethIndia-push-bounties","title":"Push x ETHIndia - $10k Push Bounties + IRL Workshop \ud83d\udd14","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Push x ETHIndia - $10k Push Bounties + IRL Workshop \ud83d\udd14","text":"Welcome to last month\u2019s developments and new product releases from the month of November!

Channel Owners now have the ability to segment and categorize different notifications and Channel Subscribers now have the ability to select notifications that match their preferences.\\n\\nJust as you might customize notifications through \u201cAdvanced Notifications Settings\u201d on your favorite web2 mobile apps, Notification Settings through Push brings a similar level of personalization to web3-native subscribers.\\n\\nSo, how do Notification Settings work for both Channel Owners and Channel Subscribers? We\u2019ll walk you through everything there is to know.\\n\\n### Notification Settings for Channel Owners\\n\\nPush is a thriving community with hundreds of diverse channels spanning DeFi, gaming, web3 media, and beyond. These channels often have a wide range of content, notifications, and updates to share with their users.\\n\\nFor example, a DeFi channel might want to send various notifications like loan liquidation alerts, price alerts, or governance proposal notifications. Just as a newsletter might want to send notifications for new articles in its blog, but wouldn\u2019t want to send every article to every subscriber.\\n\\nWith Notification Settings, Channel Owners can now define specific categories for their notifications. Consequently, when a channel triggers a notification for that specific category, only the users who\'ve opted for that preference will receive a notification.\\n\\nThere are two types of channel settings for Channel Owners:\\n\\n1. True/False Notification Settings: The first channel setting lets you set up a channel with a simple true/false trigger setting. For instance, say your channel covers web3 news. You can define settings for categories of articles like \\"tech\\" and \u201cpartnership announcements\u201d and give users the option to turn each On (true) or Off (false). Adding one of these Notification Settings for every content category gives end-users the option to opt-in for content categories that match their preferences and avoid ones that don\u2019t.\\n2. Range Value Notification Settings: The second channel setting lets you set up a range of values for a specific category that might trigger a notification. For instance, say you want to set up a Notification Setting that triggers when the price of ETH passes a given value. You can simply create a range, say from 0-10,000 and subscribers will be able to select any value within that range to set their custom ETH price notification.\\n   You can set as many or as few Notification Settings for your channel as you like.\\n   Here\u2019s how it looks.\\n\\n![Introducing Notification Settings](./image-1.webp)\\n<ImageText><b>Caption:</b> This channel has 5 Notification Settings. 4 of which are True/False Notification Settings and 1 of which is a Range Value Notification Setting. As such, end-users will have the choice to toggle on/off preferences for each of these 5 notifications separately.</ImageText>\\n\\nNote, each channel will also set a \u2018default value\u2019 setting. This ensures subscribers who opt-in without specifying their preferences will simply receive notifications based on the channel\'s default settings.\\n\\nFor builders looking to integrate Notification Settings, you can find all the relevant and associated documentation here\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/build/create-channel-settings/\\n\\n### Notification Settings for Channel Subscribers\\n\\nEmpowering Channel Subscribers (end-users) to personalize their notifications is a massive step towards a more user-centric and user-friendly web3 experience. Channel Subscribers can filter out notifications they aren\'t interested in receiving to reduce notification clutter. This optimizes user inboxes, reduces spam, and helps personalize the user experience.\\n\\nHere\u2019s how it works for Channel Subscribers:\\n\\n1. When you subscribe to a channel that has enabled Notification Settings, you\u2019ll have the option to personalize your notification preferences based on the available settings the Channel Owner has preset.\\n   The choice to customize is optional. You can always opt-in for the \u2018default values\u2019 of a channel (these \u2018default value\u2019 notifications are determined by the Channel Owner).\\n   Once you\u2019ve selected your preferences for all of the Notification Settings, you can click \u2018opt-in\u2019 to initiate the subscription and begin receiving notifications!\\n   This is how the UI will prompt you to select your choice of notification for the channel:\\n\\n![Introducing Notification Settings](./image-3.webp)\\n<ImageText><b>Caption:</b> For this channel, there are 4 available Notification Settings to pick from. 3 settings correspond to simple on-off toggles and 1 corresponds to a range value. For this range value setting, you can set any value (price) that you want to receive notifications for within that range.</ImageText>\\n\\n2. You can review all the channels you are receiving notifications for and manage those settings directly within your \u201cNotification Settings\u201d tab. This dashboard gives you a complete birds-eye-view of all your notifications and lets you edit and change your settings any time at no cost.\\n\\n![Introducing Notification Settings](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nHere are a few popular channels to get you started!\\n\\n- [Push Protocol](http://app.push.org/channels?channel=0xB88460Bb2696CAb9D66013A05dFF29a28330689D)\\n- [BTC Price Tracker](http://app.push.org/channels?channel=0x03EAAAa48ea78d1E66eA3458364d553AD981871E)\\n- [ETH Price Tracker](http://app.push.org/channels?channel=0xDBc5936E4daaE94F415C39D284f6a69c4d553F2F)\\n\\nFull list of Push channels \ud83d\udc49https://app.push.org/channels\\n\\nHere\u2019s a full demo on how to both setup and sign up for Notification Settings:\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\" }} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDJFnfzVxsQ\\" title=\\"Introducing Notification Settings: Customize Your Web3 Notifications\ud83d\udd14\u2699\ufe0f\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\n### Pushing Personalized Communication Experiences\\n\\nNotification Settings is a game-changer.\\n\\nFor Channel Owners that want to provide the best level of control and personalization for their users, Notification Settings mean being able to now categorize notifications and updates to only give users information they want.\\n\\nFor Channel Subscribers that want a personalized and engaging user experience, Notification Settings mean being able to accommodate their personal preferences.\\nAt Push, we\u2019re constantly reaffirming our commitment to decentralizing communication and onboarding the next one billion users to web3. As such, we\u2019re looking to build upon Notification Settings and release more communication personalization features soon.\\n\\nStay tuned because the best is yet to come."},{"id":"october-monthly-recap","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/october-monthly-recap","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-06-october-monthly-recap/index.md","title":"Monthly Recap October \ud83c\udf83","description":"Monthly Recap October \ud83c\udf83","date":"2023-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 6, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"},{"label":"Decentralization","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/decentralization"}],"readingTime":1.51,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"october-monthly-recap","title":"Monthly Recap October \ud83c\udf83","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Monthly Recap October \ud83c\udf83","text":"Welcome to another thrilling month at Push!

Decentralized communication has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional centralized systems, offering numerous advantages such as censorship resistance, privacy, and enhanced security.\\n\\nThis blog post dives into decentralized communication\u2019s different approaches and technologies, providing an intellectual and developer-focused comparison to help you understand the landscape better.\\n\\n## Centralized vs. Decentralized Communication: A Quick Reminder\\n\\n### Centralized Communication\\n\\nIn centralized communication systems, a single entity, such as a company or government, controls the infrastructure and data transmission. This control allows for efficient data routing and management but comes with significant drawbacks, such as the potential for censorship, surveillance, and data breaches.\\n\\n### Decentralized Communication\\n\\nDecentralized communication systems distribute control across multiple nodes or participants, ensuring no single entity has complete authority over the network. This approach offers numerous benefits, including increased privacy, security, and resistance to censorship.\\n\\n### Decentralized Communication Technologies\\n\\nVarious technologies and approaches have emerged in decentralized communication, each with unique characteristics and benefits. Below, we\u2019ll explore some of the most prominent ones:\\n\\n### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks\\n\\nP2P networks are decentralized communication systems where each node, or user, connects directly to other nodes without intermediaries. These networks provide:\\n\\n- Increased privacy and censorship resistance.\\n- Lower latency.\\n- Reduced reliance on central servers.\\n\\nExamples: BitTorrent, WebRTC, and Signal\\n\\n### Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)\\n\\nDHTs are a decentralized distributed system that stores key-value pairs across multiple nodes. These tables enable efficient and scalable routing and storage of data in P2P networks while providing fault tolerance and redundancy.\\n\\n### Examples: Kademlia, Coral, and Chord\\n\\nBlockchain-based Communication\\nBlockchain technology can be applied to decentralized communication to create secure, transparent, and tamper-proof channels. Blockchains can facilitate secure data storage and transmission and enable privacy-preserving features like zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation.\\n\\nExamples: Push Protocol\\n\\n### Mesh Networks\\n\\nMesh networks are decentralized communication systems where nodes relay messages through multiple paths to reach their destination. These networks provide increased resilience, fault tolerance, and scalability, making them ideal for use when a central infrastructure is unreliable or unavailable.\\n\\nExamples: FireChat, RightMesh, and Althea\\n\\n## Comparing Decentralized Communication Approaches\\n\\nWhen evaluating decentralized communication technologies, it\u2019s essential to consider various factors such as latency, privacy, security, scalability, and the developer ecosystem.\\n\\n### Latency\\n\\nP2P networks and mesh networks generally offer lower latency than blockchain-based communication systems, as they do not require consensus mechanisms or the storage of data on-chain. However, DHTs can add latency due to their routing and lookup mechanisms.\\n\\n### Privacy and Security\\n\\nWith end-to-end encryption, blockchain-based communication and P2P networks provide strong privacy and security guarantees. Zero-knowledge proofs and other advanced cryptographic techniques can further enhance privacy in blockchain-based communication systems.\\n\\n### Scalability\\n\\nDHTs and P2P networks can provide a solution great scalability, as they can distribute data storage and routing across multiple nodes. However, they often require complex setups and can face certain limitations in terms of node discovery, persistence, and network consistency.\\n\\n### Developer Ecosystem\\n\\nWhen selecting a decentralized communication technology, consider the maturity and robustness of the developer ecosystem. Examine the available tools, libraries, and community support to ensure you can effectively build and maintain your decentralized communication application.\\n\\n## How Does Push Protocol Relate to Other Decentralized Communication Methods?\\n\\nPush Protocol is a comprehensive decentralized communication solution that combines the best aspects of P2P communication, blockchain-based messaging and distributed messaging platforms.\\n\\nIn light of the additional context provided, let\u2019s dive deeper into how Push Protocol compares to other decentralized communication methods, keeping the unique features and characteristics of Push Protocol in mind.\\n\\n## Push Protocol as P2P Communication\\n\\nWhile Push Protocol is a form of P2P communication, it expands upon traditional P2P communication by integrating blockchain technology, smart contract interactions, and wallet-to-wallet communication. This combination allows Push Protocol to offer a more secure, decentralized, and user-centric communication experience tailored to the needs of the Web3 ecosystem.\\n\\n- <b>Channels and Opt-in</b>: Push Protocol enables communication channels,\\n  which allow wallet addresses to opt in or subscribe to receive notifications.\\n  This user-centric approach ensures that users only receive notifications they\\n  are interested in, minimizing spam and unwanted messages.\\n- <b>Decentralized Network of Push Nodes</b>: Push Protocol is maintained by a\\n  decentralized network of Push Nodes, each having a specific role in validating\\n  and delivering messages between wallet addresses. This architecture provides a\\n  higher degree of redundancy and resiliency than traditional P2P networks.\\n- <b>Encryption and Verification Proof</b>: Push Protocol uses PGP encryption to\\n  secure messages and provides a Verification Proof mechanism for validating the\\n  sender, the chain, and the content of messages. This ensures data integrity\\n  and privacy, which may be lacking in traditional P2P communication systems.\\n\\n## Push Protocol and Blockchain-based Messaging\\n\\nWhile Push Protocol utilizes blockchain communication, it incorporates blockchain-based messaging elements, such as user addresses and cryptography for secure communication. However, Push Protocol goes beyond essential blockchain communication by supporting any network, not just blockchain and web3, enabling more extensive interoperability and flexibility.\\n\\n- <b>Native Integration with Wallet Addresses</b>: Push Protocol enables\\n  communication between wallet addresses without needing personal information.\\n  This contrasts with some blockchain-based messaging systems that require\\n  additional information or rely on smart contract-based user management.\\n- <b>IPFS-based Storage</b>: Messages in Push Protocol are stored on IPFS,\\n  ensuring decentralized and tamper-proof storage, while some blockchain-based\\n  messaging systems store messages directly on the blockchain, which can be less\\n  efficient and more costly.\\n- <b>Spam Prevention</b>: Push Protocol focuses on spam prevention through\\n  opt-in channels, chat requests, and inbox/request separation. In contrast,\\n  some blockchain-based messaging systems might not have built-in spam\\n  prevention mechanisms or rely solely on transaction fees to deter spam.\\n\\n## Push Protocol and Distributed Messaging Platforms\\n\\nPush Protocol offers unique features like opt-in channels, gasless transactions, and PGP encryption to create a seamless, secure, and user-centric communication experience.\\n\\n- <b>Built for Web3 Ecosystem</b>: Push Protocol is designed for the Web3\\n  ecosystem, enabling wallet-to-wallet and dapp-to-dapp communication. This\\n  focus ensures better integration and usability for Web3 applications than\\n  general-purpose distributed messaging platforms.\\n- <b>User-Centric Approach</b>: With its opt-in channels and chat request\\n  mechanisms, Push Protocol adopts a user-centric approach to communication.\\n  This empowers users to control their communication experience and minimize\\n  spam, while some distributed messaging platforms might offer less fine-grained\\n  control.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUnderstanding these unique characteristics and advantages of Push Protocol compared to other decentralized communication methods enables developers to make more informed decisions about the technology that best suits their needs and build innovative applications that cater to the evolving demands of users in the digital world."},{"id":"august-monthly-recap","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/august-monthly-recap","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-01-august-monthly-recap/index.md","title":"August Monthly Recap","description":"Cover image of August Monthly Recap","date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technologies","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technologies"}],"readingTime":2.21,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"august-monthly-recap","title":"August Monthly Recap","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Step into the newest chapter of our Push journey!\\nAugust brought a wave of excitement and progress, full of achievements we can\u2019t wait to share with you.

Through its Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, QuickSwap enables users to exchange tokens seamlessly in liquidity pools without the need for a traditional order book.\\n\\nIn addition to its core offerings, QuickSwap is building out its DragonFi Ecosystem as a one-stop shop for DeFi on Polygon \u2014 a place where Polygon users can come to trade, lend and borrow funds, play games, and more! This acts as a hub for various products such as QuickPerps, a decentralized Perpetual Exchange, and the Gaming Hub, further enriching the DeFi landscape.\\n\\nIn a significant development recently announced, we are excited to share that the [$PUSH token is now live on QuickSwap](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-is-live-on-polygon-quickswap-b683ef0f71d8), expanding the utility and accessibility of the $PUSH token within the Polygon ecosystem, and offering users new avenues to engage with the token. In addition, Quickswap will be using Push\u2019s communication layer to send notifications to DeFi users on the platform and alert them about their positions and other on-chain actions.\\n\\nThis edition of \u201cFrens of Push\u201d features an interview with QuickSwap, shedding light on their mission, technology, and collaboration with Push. Let\u2019s dive in!\\n\\n### 1. Tell us about QuickSwap \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem does QuickSwap solve?\\n\\nQuickSwap is the leading DEX and AMM on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, and Dogechain where users can trade, swap, LP, farm, and take part in other DeFi activities at lightning fast speeds and with near-zero gas fees. The DEX has helped spark adoption for DeFi across the Polygon ecosystem and has become an attractive environment for DeFi because of fast transaction speeds and low gas fees, in addition to the DragonFi ecosystem which serves as a hub for other products, such as QuickPerps (decentralized Perpetual Exchange) and the Gaming Hub.\\n\\n### 2. How do developers use QuickSwap? (feel free to add a step-by-step guide or quick tutorial like a video here )\\n\\nReferences here https://docs.quickswap.exchange/ https://github.com/QuickSwap\\n\\n### 3. What\u2019s the 2023 plan for QuickSwap\u2019s ecosystem?\\n\\nMultiple integrations with projects on all 3 ecosystems and QuickPerps \u2014 more info to be revealed but integrations mostly aimed at enhancing the UI/UX and adding more features for DEX users\\n\\n### 4. How is QuickSwap using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\nQuickSwap will be using Push\u2019s Web3 communication layer to enable push notifications for DeFi users on the DEX who want to be alerted about their positions and any other on-chain actions related to swaps, LP, farms, leverage trades, etc.\\n\\n### 5. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\nIt\u2019s a pretty smooth UI and easy to understand, I like the simplicity. It seems to also offer a wide range of notifications and features\\n\\n### 6. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\nPerhaps besides just on-chain actions users could have a checklist of things they want to opt into for each protocol, such as other types of news feeds, updates on token listings, etc.\\n\\n## About Quickswap\\n\\nQuickSwap stands as a next-generation layer-2 DEX and AMM operating on Polygon. It facilitates rapid token swaps, liquidity provision, and yield farming with minimal gas fees. The platform\u2019s AMM model eliminates order books, promoting seamless token exchange through liquidity pools.\\n\\nFor more information about Quickswap, check out their: [Website](https://quickswap.exchange/#/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/QuickswapDEX), [Telegram](https://t.me/QuickSwapDEX), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dSMd7AFH36), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPlF-DBwD-UzLFDzJ4Z5Fw), [Medium](https://quickswap-layer2.medium.com/)"},{"id":"introducing-the-push-ambassador-india-program","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/introducing-the-push-ambassador-india-program","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-17-introducing-the-push-ambassador/index.md","title":"Introducing the Push Ambassador India Program\ud83c\udf38","description":"Cover image of Introducing the Push Ambassador India Program\ud83c\udf38","date":"2023-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 17, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Ambassador Program","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ambassador-program"},{"label":"Partnerships","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/partnerships"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technologies","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technologies"}],"readingTime":2.3,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"introducing-the-push-ambassador-india-program","title":"Introducing the Push Ambassador India Program\ud83c\udf38","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.png","text":"Following the recent success of our Push Ambassador Program in LATAM, we are thrilled to be expanding our Ambassador Program to India!","tags":["Push Protocol","Ambassador Program","Partnerships","Web3","Blockchain Technologies"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Enhancing the DeFi UX on Polygon | Push x QuickSwap\ud83d\udc32","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/enhancing-the-de-fi-ux-on-polygon-push-x-quick-swap"},"nextItem":{"title":"July Monthly Recap\u2728","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/july-monthly-recap"}},"content":"![Cover image of Introducing the Push Ambassador India Program\ud83c\udf38](./cover-image.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\x3c!--customheaderpoint--\x3e\\n\\n# We\u2019re looking for new ambassadors in India to join us!\\n\\nFollowing the recent success of our Push Ambassador Program in LATAM, we are thrilled to be expanding our Ambassador Program to India!\\n\\nThe Push Ambassador India Program is an exciting expansion of our community initiative designed to grow our presence and foster a dynamic community of web3 enthusiasts across India.

All these features aim at empowering users, rewarding participation, creating a circular economy to democratize web3 communication and expand the horizons of dApp UX possibilities. We\u2019re excited for the future!\\n\\nAnother major highlight of July was the [launch of $PUSH token on Polygon and Quickswap](https://push-protocol.medium.com/push-is-live-on-polygon-quickswap-b683ef0f71d8), providing multi-chain accessibility, usability, and composability. This launch, coupled with the Push v2 launch, unlocks new utility for $PUSH, creating endless possibilities for developers within the Polygon ecosystem.\\n\\nFollowing the successful launch of $PUSH on Polygon, we launched the [$PUSH-USDC lending & borrowing pool on Timeswap](https://push-protocol.medium.com/pushing-ahead-in-time-push-x-timeswap-6a94edaffc03), enabling users to borrow $PUSH at a fixed interest rate and lend $PUSH to earn a fixed interest rate.

Go to Yield Farming v2 Page on PUSH Dapp \ud83d\udc49 https://app.push.org/yieldv2\\n2. Go to the left-hand part of the UI that displays the <b>PUSH Fee Staking Pool</b>.\\n3. Click on the <b>Stake PUSH</b> button\\n4. Once you click on stake, you will be prompted to enter the PUSH token amount you wish to stake. \ud83d\udc47\\n\\n![Prompt to enter the PUSH token amount Image](./staking-pool.webp)\\n\\n5. Then, simply click on <b>Approve PUSH</b> button to approve the transfer of your tokens.\\n\\n6. Once completed, you should have the option to click on the <b>Deposit</b> button right away.\\n\\n7. After successful execution of your transaction, you should see the right staked amount in the UI.\\n\\n![Right staked amount in the UI Image](./staking-pool2.webp)\\n\\n### Unstaking $PUSH Tokens\\n\\n1. Simply click on the <b>Unstake PUSH</b> button to unstake from the staking pool.\\n2. After successful execution of your transaction, your tokens should be unstaked from the contract and transferred back to your wallet.\\n\\n<b>Important considerations for the unstaking procedure in Push Fee Staking Pool:</b>\\n\\n- The pool <b>doesn\u2019t impose any lock-in period</b>. This means holders are free to stake or un-stake whenever they wish.\\n- While no lock-in period is imposed, <b>there is a delay period of at least one epoch before a user can withdraw or harvest</b>. This means that any stake (within the current epoch) will require the user to wait T+1 epoch before they can claim rewards or withdraw their harvest. 1 epoch is 21 days long.\\n  Unstaking tokens in this pool will automatically harvest and transfer any pending reward tokens to your wallet as well.\\n  \ud83d\udfe3 UNI-V2 LP Staking Pool\\n  The UNI-V2 LP staking pool allows you to stake your LP tokens and earn yields for the same.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<i>\\n    <b>Note:</b> In order to participate in this pool, providing liquidity to the PUSH/ETH Uniswap pool is the first step.

Go to the [PUSH/ETH V2 pool on Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/ETH/0xf418588522d5dd018b425E472991E52EBBeEEEEE) (Remember to navigate to Uniswap V2 pool and not V3 pool).\\n2. Add liquidity into the pool with both $PUSH and $ETH.\\n3. Once added, you should receive UNI-V2 LP tokens in your wallet.\\n4. You are now ready to stake to these LP tokens into for Push V2 reward program.\\n\\n### Staking UNI-V2 LP tokens\\n\\n1. Go to Yield Farming v2 Page on PUSH Dapp \ud83d\udc49 https://app.push.org/yieldv2\\n2. Go to the right-hand part of the UI that displays <b>Uniswap v2 LP Staking Pool.</b>\\n3. Click on the <b>Stake $UNI-V2 LP Tokens</b> button\\n\\n![Click on the \'Stake $UNI-V2 LP Tokens\' button Image](./staking-pool3.webp)\\n\\n4. Enter the amount of LP tokens to be staked, and click on <b>Approve Uni-V2</b>\\n\\n5. Once approved, simply click on the <b>Deposit</b> button.\\n\\n![Click on the \'Deposit\' button](./staking-pool4.webp)\\n\\n6. After successful execution of your transaction, you should the right staked amount in the UI.\\n\\n### Unstaking UNI-V2 LP Tokens\\n\\n1. Click on <b>Unstake UNI-V2</b> button.\\n2. This will trigger a metamask Pop-UP. Once confirmed you should simply be able to unstake your LP tokens from the pool.\\n\\n## How to Claim Rewards\\n\\nClaiming rewards for both the pools is fairly similar.\\n\\n1. Go to the respective pool on [Push Dapp Yield Farming V2 page](https://app.push.org/yieldv2).\\n2. Click on the <b>Claim Rewards</b> button of the PUSH Fee Staking Pool or UNI-V2 Staking Pool.\\n3. Confirm the transaction and rewards will be transferred to your wallet.\\n\\nHowever, there are a couple of considerations to keep in mind related when harvesting rewards.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd34 Harvesting in PUSH Fee Staking Pool\\n\\nThe very first claim reward procedure for this pool shall include two transactions:\\n\\n- 1st Transaction is <b>to Set Holder Delegation for the Push Core Contract address.</b>\\n- 2nd transaction is to trigger the <b>primary harvest function of the Push core contract</b> to release the rewards.\\n\\n<b>What exactly is Setting Holder Delegation?</b>\\n\\n- The $PUSH token has a time-weightage feature within itself which allows the contract to calculate the holder weight of a $PUSH token holder based on how long he/she has been holding the token.\\n- During the harvest, the core contract is designed to be capable of updating the holder weight of the caller to the latest block.\\n- Therefore, this <b>set holder delegation</b>transaction approves the main Push Core contract to be capable of updating holder weight whenever needed.\\n- It should be noted that this permission can be revoked anytime by the user.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<i>\\n    <b>Note:</b> The setting holder delegation is a one-time process and only takes place during the very first instance of claiming rewards.\\n</i>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n### \ud83d\udfe3 Harvesting in UNI-V2 LP Staking Pool\\n\\n- The steps for harvesting in UNI-V2 LP Staking Pool are identical to that of harvesting in the PUSH Fee Staking Pool\\n- Go to the UNI-V2 LP Pool on [Push Dapp Yield Farming V2 page](https://app.push.org/yieldv2).\\n- Click on the Claim Rewards button of the UNI-V2 Staking Pool.\\n- Confirm the transaction and rewards will be transferred to your wallet.\\n\\n## How to migrate from the old staking pool to the new pool?\\n\\nIf you\u2019re an early holder of $PUSH, chances are you\u2019ve staked in the first rewards program.\\n\\nIf that\u2019s the case for you, the migration feature is specifically designed to provide you with a smooth and easy procedure to shift from the old staking pool to the new v2 staking pool.\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\" }} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3QDLsT0VRM\\" title=\\"Push Migration Guide | $PUSH\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\nMigration from old to new pools requires 3 simple transactions:\\n\\n1. <b>Unstaking from old contracts:</b> This transaction withdraws your staked tokens from the old contracts.\\n2. <b>Approval of tokens:</b> This ensures you approve the new staking pool contracts.\\n3. <b>Staking into new pool:</b> The final transaction ensures a successful deposit of your tokens to the new staking pools.\\n\\nIn order to perform the migration procedure, please follow the steps below:\\n\\n1. Go to Yield Farming v2 Page on PUSH Dapp \ud83d\udc49 https://app.push.org/yieldv2\\n2. Go to the <b>Yield Farming V1 (Deprecated)</b> section.\\n\\n![Yield Farming V1 (Deprecated) Image](./staking-pool5.webp)\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd34 For Push Staking Pool Migration\\n\\n1. Simply go to the Push Staking Pool section\\n2. Click on <b>Migrate to PUSH Fee Pool</b> button\\n3. After the above-mentioned 3 transactions, your staked tokens will be migrated from the previous $PUSH Token staking contract to the new $PUSH Fee Staking Pool <b><i>(which essentially is the main Push Core contract itself).</i></b>\\n\\n### \ud83d\udfe3 For UNI V2 Staking Pool\\n\\n1. The procedure remains the same as mentioned above.\\n2. However, in this migration, your tokens will be staked in the new UNI-V2 Staking Pool.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<i>\\n<b>Note:</b> Unstaking tokens from old staking contracts doesn\u2019t ensure the claiming of pending rewards. Make sure you claim pending rewards (if any) from old staking pools after the migration is completed.\\n\\nIn order to claim any available pending reward from your previous pools, you can click on the Claim Rewards button of that respective pool in the Yield Farming V1 section.\\n</i>\\n\\n</blockquote>"},{"id":"new-push-yield-farming-rewards-full-details","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/new-push-yield-farming-rewards-full-details","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-02-new-push-yield/index.md","title":"New Push Yield Farming Rewards: Full Details\ud83e\ude99","description":"Cover image of New Push Yield Farming Rewards: Full Details\ud83e\ude99","date":"2023-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 2, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Yield Farming","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/yield-farming"},{"label":"Liquidity Mining","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/liquidity-mining"}],"readingTime":3.95,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"new-push-yield-farming-rewards-full-details","title":"New Push Yield Farming Rewards: Full Details\ud83e\ude99","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Push Liquidity Rewards Program v1 ended a few weeks ago and v2 is now HERE\ud83c\udf89 With v2 comes a whole new set of liquidity rewards that provide robust incentives for all liquidity providers and token holders.","tags":["Push Protocol","Web3","Yield Farming","Liquidity Mining"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Staking & Migration Guide for PushV2 Rewards Program\ud83d\udcdc","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/staking-and-migration-guide-for-push-v2-rewards-program"},"nextItem":{"title":"Push V2 is LIVE \u2014 New Rewards, Utility & Functionality \ud83d\ude80","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-v2-is-live-new-rewards-utility-and-functionality"}},"content":"![Cover image of New Push Yield Farming Rewards: Full Details\ud83e\ude99](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\x3c!--customheaderpoint--\x3e\\n\\n# 2 new liquidity reward pools to earn $PUSH from.\\n\\nPush Liquidity Rewards Program v1 ended a few weeks ago and v2 is now HERE\ud83c\udf89\\n\\nWith v2 comes a whole new set of liquidity rewards that provide robust incentives for all liquidity providers and token holders.\\n\\nMost notably, $PUSH token holders now have the ability to stake directly in the Core v2 contract\u2019s staking feature to earn rewards directly from our Core contract via the Push Fee Pool. This means stakers will now have the opportunity to earn incentives as the protocol continues to flourish.\\n\\nBegin staking \ud83d\udc49 https://app.push.org/yieldv2\\n\\n## Brief Glance at Push Liquidity Rewards Program v2\\n\\n1. <b>The v2 liquidity rewards program provides two options for participation:</b> UNI-v2 LP Token Staking: Similar to v1 incentive program, this procedure allows users to stake their UNI-v2 LP tokens in our staking contract and earn $PUSH tokens as a reward.\\n2. <b>Push Fee Pool Staking:</b> The second procedure is the new staking feature of the Push Core V2 smart contract that allows users to directly stake in the core contract itself and earn rewardsx in $PUSH Tokens.\\n\\nThe Push Fee Pool collects $PUSH tokens in fees for Push Notifications, Channel-related actions, and Chat. These fees are hence distributed to all stakers in the Core v2 smart contract. Put most simply, these rewards are directly linked to the protocol\u2019s growth. As the protocol grows with more channels, so do the fees and hence incentives that Push Fee Pool stakers can receive.\\n\\n## Important Details About the new Incentive Program\\n\\n1. All rewards will be distributed in $PUSH tokens.\\n2. A total of <b>3,414,700 $PUSH</b> is allocated towards this reward program.\\n3. Epoch Duration: Each epoch will be <b>21 days</b> long in the new rewards program. This is for both staking programs <b>UNI-v2 Staking and Protocol Fee Pool Staking.</b>.\\n4. Staking will only be available through the official Push dApp [Incentives \u2014 Yield Farming page](https://app.push.org/yieldv2).\\n   While these are the high-level details related to Push Liquidity Rewards Program v2, let\u2019s now dive in to get a complete understanding of the two different types of staking mechanisms.\\n\\n## Push Fee Pool Staking Details\\n\\n1. The staking mechanism in core v2 is epoch-based staking. That is, the entire distribution of rewards is split into epochs during which users can stake and rewards can be accumulated.\\n\\n2. <b>Epoch Duration</b>: Each epoch is <b>~21 days or 3 weeks long.</b>\\n\\n3. <b>Total Rewards Allocated: 1,323,100 PUSH + Core V2 Protocol Fees</b>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n    <i>\\n    <b>Note:</b> The Push Fee Pool consists of two $PUSH token sources. The first source is from the collection of fees *that the protocol earns from channel specific actions like channel creation (as previously mentioned). The second source is from a manual release of 1,323,100 $PUSH tokens for every epoch. As such, staking in the Push Fee Pool entitles you to earn rewards from both these sources simultaneously\\n    </i>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n4. <b>Staking $PUSH tokens</b>:\\n\\n- $PUSH token holders can stake their tokens at any given time in the Core v2 contract.\\n- $PUSH has time weightage built in. This means people who have held $PUSH longer are rewarded more the longer they stake.\\n\\n5. Unstaking $PUSH Tokens\\n\\n- The staking algorithm of Core contract <b>doesn\u2019t impose any lock-in period.</b> This means holders are free to stake or un-stake whenever they wish.\\n- While no lock-in period is imposed, there is a delay period of at least one epoch before a user can withdraw or harvest. This means that any stake during a current epoch will require the user to at least wait T+1 epoch before they can claim rewards or withdraw their harvest. This is done to ensure bad actors can\u2019t misuse epoch duration for unfair rewards.\\n\\n6. <b>Reward Harvesting</b>\\n\\n- The total rewards available and claimable in an epoch rely on the protocol\u2019s fee pool, i.e. the amount of $PUSH earned by the protocol itself. The more $PUSH tokens accumulated by the protocol during an epoch, the more rewards for the stakers of that specific epoch.\\n- When it comes to harvesting rewards from the contract, users harvest rewards for all the epochs in which they were staked.\\n  **This basically means the longer a user stakes, the more rewards they should be able to harvest.**\\n\\n- Mentioned below is the formula used to calculate the rewards of any staker in a given epoch (N) \ud83d\udc47\\n\\n![User rewards calculation Image](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n    <i>\\n    <b>Note:</b> An important detail here is users cannot claim rewards for the current epoch. For instance, if a user stakes at epoch 1 and tries to claim at epoch 6 (which is the current epoch), that user will only be able to claim for epochs 1 to 5. This is because epoch 6 is currently active, and the contract doesn\u2019t allow claiming rewards from a current epoch.\\n    </i>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n## UNI-v2 LP Token Staking Details\\n\\n1. The UNI-V2 LP staking is exactly the same to the previous staking program. That is, $PUSH token holders earn incentives for providing liquidity on Uniswap.\\n\\n2. <b>Total Rewards Allocated: 1,743,000 $PUSH tokens</b>\\n\\n3. <b>Epoch Duration</b>: Each epoch is <b>~21 days long or 3 weeks long.</b>\\n\\n4. <b>Staking UNI-V2 Tokens</b>\\n\\n- In order to stake in this program, users will first need to provide liquidity for PUSH on Uniswap.\\n- This can be done by visiting the [PUSH/ETH Uniswap Pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xf418588522d5dd018b425e472991e52ebbeeeeee) and adding liquidity. Once added, users will be given Uniswap-V2 LP tokens which can then be staked on the UNI-V2 LP staking pool on the [Push dApp](https://app.push.org/yieldv2), to begin earning rewards.\\n\\n5. <b>Withdrawing UNI-V2 Tokens</b>\\n\\n- Users can withdraw their their UNI-V2 LP tokens from the [Push dApp staking portal](https://app.push.org/yieldv2) at any time.\\n\\n6. Reward Harvesting\\n\\n- Liquidity providers can harvest rewards for their staked amount by simply clicking onto the <b> Claim Rewards</b> button on the [Push Dapp Yield Farming V2 page.](https://app.push.org/yieldv2)\\n- Allocated rewards will decrease for each sequential epoch.\\n- Rewards will be distributed at the end of each epoch (21 days), to be shared in % proportion to a user\u2019s contribution to the pool.\\n- Earlier participants in the staking program will earn higher rewards.\\n\\n7.

This partnership opens up new opportunities for users to borrow and lend Push native tokens ($PUSH) while benefiting from the extensive functionalities and composability offered by TimeSwap and the Polygon network.\\n\\nPolygon, known for its high scalability and low transaction costs, provides the perfect environment to enhance the utility and functionalities of the $PUSH token. We couldn\u2019t be more excited to start this journey!\\n\\n## Push x Timeswap\\n\\nTimeswap is the first fully decentralized AMM-based money market protocol that is non-custodial, immutable, censorship-resistant, and works without oracles or liquidators.\\n\\nWith the launch of the lending pool on TimeSwap, users can now borrow and lend $PUSH tokens on the Polygon mainnet, further enhancing the token\u2019s utility and expanding its composability.\\n\\nThrough this partnership, Push gains access to Polygon\u2019s ecosystem, offering users increased opportunities to explore various DeFi strategies, including:\\n\\n- Borrowing $PUSH at a fixed interest rate\\n- Earn a fixed interest rate by lending $PUSH\\n\\n### A quick rundown of the pool\\n\\nThe PUSH-USDC pool will enable fixed-rate lending/borrowing of $PUSH token using USDC as collateral, with an initial APR of 30%.\\n\\n- <b>Pair:</b> PUSH/USDC\\n- <b>Asset to be lent/borrowed:</b> PUSH\\n- <b>Collateral:</b> USDC\\n- <b>Transition price:</b> 0.40 PUSH/USDC\\n- <b>Initial APR:</b> 30 %\\n\\nIn addition, Timeswap offers various benefits and customizable options that enhance their borrowing and lending experience for users like:\\n\\n- <b>No risk of sudden liquidation:</b> Unlike other protocols where borrowers may face liquidation during market volatility, TimeSwap offers non-liquidatable loans. Instead of being immediately liquidated, borrowers are given the opportunity to repay their debt before maturity. In case of default, their collateral is distributed to lenders or liquidity providers.\\n- <b>Adjustable APR and Collateral Ratio:</b> TimeSwap provides users with the ability to customize their APR (Annual Percentage Rate) and CDP (Collateral Debt Position) ratio, allowing borrowers and lenders to adjust to their individual risk tolerance and market conditions.\\n- <b>Market-determined CDP:</b> On Timeswap, the collateral ratio is determined by market participants instead of centralized entities or DAO governance, enabling cheaper loans and higher leverages.\\n\\nWe are incredibly excited about our partnership with Timeswap. This collaboration not only strengthens the Push ecosystem but also provides users with increased opportunities to participate in decentralized borrowing, lending, and earning. We cannot wait to see the beginning of a long journey with Timeswap!\\n\\n## $PUSH Token and its Utilities\\n\\nPush addresses a critical need in web3 by providing a decentralized communication protocol for dApp builders and web3 users. Push operates in a gasless, multi-chain, and platform-agnostic manner, facilitating seamless interactions among wallet addresses.\\n\\nPowering the Push ecosystem is the $PUSH token, fostering a circular economy within the protocol and incentivizing community participation. The $PUSH token serves several key purposes, including securing the network, network utility, Push DAO governance, and the reward pool fee. Let\u2019s take a deeper dive into each of these:\\n\\n### 1. Securing the Network\\n\\nPush Nodes are incentivized to act in the network\u2019s best interest through the use of $PUSH tokens in Proof of Stake. Nodes that remain synced and support network consensus are rewarded with $PUSH tokens, while those acting against the network\u2019s interests are penalized.\\n\\n### 2. Network Utility\\n\\n$PUSH tokens are used as payment for message broadcasting on the Push network. Users must pay in $PUSH tokens to ensure their messages reach all interested parties. This incentivizes network nodes to relay the messages, contributing to a fast and reliable communication network.\\n\\n### 3. Push DAO and Governance\\n\\n53% of the $PUSH token supply is allocated to the community, empowering token holders to participate in governance and shape the future of Push Protocol. Token holders have the right to vote on critical decisions, including the staking structure, reward distribution rates, and other essential aspects of the protocol\u2019s functioning.\\n\\n### 4. Push Fee Pool\\n\\nThe Push Fee Pool is designed to reward participants within the ecosystem, creating a circular economy. Fees collected at the protocol level, such as charges for \u201csuper users\u201d and utility features, are distributed to $PUSH token holders, wallets that adopt Push, and other stakeholders contributing to the ecosystem\u2019s growth and decentralization. The time-weighted feature of the $PUSH token ensures that long-term holders receive higher rewards.\\n\\nAdditionally, we\u2019re continuing to develop new token utilities to drive adoption and participation as we expand our capabilities and presence on multiple chains. Our next big utility development is our launch on TimeSwap!"},{"id":"push-is-live-on-polygon-and-quickswap","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-is-live-on-polygon-and-quickswap","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-25-push-is-live-on/index.md","title":"$PUSH is Live on Polygon & Quickswap!\ud83d\udc9c","description":"Cover image of $PUSH is Live on Polygon & Quickswap!\ud83d\udc9c","date":"2023-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 25, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Yield Farming","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/yield-farming"},{"label":"Liquidity Mining","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/liquidity-mining"},{"label":"Polygon Network","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/polygon-network"}],"readingTime":1.5333333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-is-live-on-polygon-and-quickswap","title":"$PUSH is Live on Polygon & Quickswap!\ud83d\udc9c","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Today we are excited to announce the launch of the $PUSH token on Polygon!

Specifically, our solutions have been built to provide a better UX, privacy, censorship-resistance, and community incentives.\\n\\nPush Spaces is currently available for audio streaming, with video streaming coming soon.\\n\\nReady to get started with Push Spaces?[ Start here!](https://push.org/spaces)\\n\\nAre you a developer wanting to integrate Push Spaces into your dApp? See our developer resources [here.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/restapi#for-spaces)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image2.webp)\\n\\n## The Roadmap to Push Spaces\\n\\nWe\u2019ve been [chatting about Push Spaces](https://twitter.com/harshrajat/status/1680123902465306624) for a little while, helping the web3 ecosystem imagine a world of decentralized, community-based streaming. Push Spaces comes on the heels of months of turmoil in the web2 social media space, ranging from corporate discord, censorship risks, and persistent UX pitfalls.\\n\\nSince its launch in early 2020, Push Protocol (previously EPNS) has been building out the decentralized communication layer for web3, starting with decentralized notifications. Recently, we announced [Push Chat](https://medium.com/push-protocol/announcing-the-push-chat-alpha-launch-f183765ec522), wallet-to-wallet text and video chat. With Push Spaces, we\u2019re continuing to offer applications for developers and users alike, all built off the same multichain communication technology.\\n\\n## Push Spaces for Users\\n\\nPush Spaces is designed to intuitively operate like Twitter Spaces. Individuals can browse live and upcoming Push Spaces that are scheduled by individual wallets with host names, subject titles, and event information. Just like Twitter Spaces, you can host or join any open Push Spaces and chat, speak, and react. To host or join a Push Spaces, you need a crypto wallet, and Push is currently compatible with Ethereum, Polygon, BSC wallets. No transaction signature or gas/fee payment is needed to use Push Spaces.\\n\\nHowever, a \u201cdecentralized Twitter Spaces\u201d is only the beginning of the vision for Push Spaces. As an open source protocol, Push invites developers to innovate on new ways to envision how audio and video streaming can look, including token-gated Spaces for community members.\\n\\n## Push Spaces for Developers\\n\\nThe Push Spaces app is live for the earliest version of audio streaming. But that\u2019s only the beginning. We invite all web3 developers to explore how the Push Protocol suite can create a more complete and user-friendly dapp experience. Think about an application that delivers personalized notifications to users\u2019 wallets, allows them to chat with customer support through decentralized chat, and keeps the community updated through regular decentralized Spaces \u2014 all done seamlessly, permissionlessly, and from the same verifiable wallets.\\n\\nJoin the community of developers already building on Push Protocol, and get started with Push Spaces \u2014 [start here!](https://push.org/spaces)\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\" }} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QK6wx1wJ66A\\" title=\\"Push Spaces is Live! \u2728\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>"},{"id":"5-tips-for-mastering-the-art-of-successful-grant-proposals","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/5-tips-for-mastering-the-art-of-successful-grant-proposals","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-19-5-tips-for-mastering/index.md","title":"5 Tips for Mastering The Art of Successful Grant Proposals\ud83d\udcdd","description":"Cover image of 5 Tips for Mastering The Art of Successful Grant Proposals\ud83d\udcdd","date":"2023-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 19, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Grant","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/grant"},{"label":"Web Grant","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-grant"},{"label":"Grant Writing","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/grant-writing"}],"readingTime":1.8533333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"5-tips-for-mastering-the-art-of-successful-grant-proposals","title":"5 Tips for Mastering The Art of Successful Grant Proposals\ud83d\udcdd","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"When it comes to project growth, seeking external assistance is crucial.

In the web3 landscape, grants have emerged as a valuable form of funding, but navigating the intricacies of grant applications can be challenging.\\n\\nFortunately, we\u2019ve gathered expert insights from \u201cThe Art of Successful Grant Proposals\u201d Twitter space from Push Protocol in which Azeem Khan, Carlos Melgar and Ben West shared these insights and offered valuable tips to enhance your grant proposal game and increase your chances of securing funding for your project.\\n\\n### 1. Showcase Your Portfolio: Demonstrate Your Track Record\\n\\nOne common pitfall in grant applications is neglecting to highlight your past achievements. Whether in Web 2 or Web 3 projects, the individuals behind the project are essential considerations for grant providers and voters. They seek assurance of your abilities and commitment. Therefore, ensure that your application showcases your portfolio as a testament to your expertise and success.\\n\\n### 2. Research Grant Providers: Understand Their Values\\n\\nNot all grants are the same, and each program has its unique criteria and philosophy. Some employ quadratic funding, while others have reward programs or committee evaluations. To increase your chances of success, conduct thorough research on the grant provider and align your project with their values and goals. This alignment will position your proposal as a perfect fit for their ecosystem.\\n\\n### 3. Craft an Engaging and Concise Application: Stand Out from the Crowd\\n\\nIn a sea of grant applications, capturing attention is paramount. Craft your proposal in an attractive and concise manner that stands out from the rest. Employ a creative writing style that effectively communicates your project\u2019s value proposition.

The technology under our microscope today is zero-knowledge technology, the inherent strengths of which, developers are tirelessly examining for possible integration into Push Protocol.\\n\\nIn the ensuing sections, we will navigate through the intricacies of these technologies, the potential of their union, the challenges on the horizon, and their practical use cases. By shedding light on the role of zero-knowledge tech in decentralized communication, we aim to foster an environment conducive to novel breakthroughs in decentralized coordination and collaboration. We hope to stimulate the intellectual curiosity of developers and community members, spurring them to contribute actively to the governance and progressive development of Push Protocol.\\n\\n## Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Rollups: Enhancing Scalability\\n\\n### An Exploration into Zero-Knowledge Proofs: zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs\\n\\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) function as cryptographic keys, enabling one entity to convince another of their knowledge without giving away the details. The two leading constructions of ZKP, zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, present varying trade-offs when it comes to proof size, verification speed, and computational requisites.\\n\\n### The Mechanism of Rollups: A Second-Layer Scaling Panacea\\n\\nRollups, a potent second-layer solution, compress multiple transactions or operations off-chain into a single proof that then finds a place in the underlying blockchain. This strategy significantly reduces the load on-chain and enhances speed and throughput. Zero-knowledge rollups amalgamate the strengths of ZKP with scalability optimization, all while maintaining a high standard of privacy and security.\\n\\n## How Might ZKRs be used in Push Protocol?\\n\\nIncorporating zero-knowledge rollups into the Push Protocol can bring about a wide range of benefits. In the following section, we\u2019re going to look at how different features of ZKR can power Push Protocol. At the same time, we want to inspire our community to think about the future design of the underlying protocol that enables decentralized communication for web3. We also hope to encourage proposals that could shape the next stage of the protocol\u2019s development.\\n\\n### Minimized On-Chain Data Footprint and Latency\\n\\nIncorporating zero-knowledge rollups facilitates the compression of multiple messages or transactions into a single proof. This mechanism minimizes on-chain data footprint and latency, allowing quicker message delivery and a surge in throughput.\\n\\n### High Throughput Coupled with Uncompromised Security\\n\\nZero-knowledge rollups help maintain privacy and security, despite increased throughput. The off-chain bundling of messages retains their integrity and confidentiality, aiding developers in designing high-performance applications without compromising user privacy.\\n\\n### Full-proof Confidentiality in Messaging\\n\\nThe integration of zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs in the Push Protocol allows developers to ensure absolute confidentiality in messages. This encryption extends to the content, sender, and receiver information. These ZKPs ensure privacy-preserving authentication and message verification without revealing sensitive details.\\n\\n### Seamless Communication Across Multiple Blockchains\\n\\nThe inclusion of zero-knowledge proofs into Push Protocol could catalyze cross-chain interoperability. This integration would enhance the overall utility of the protocol, promote a more interconnected and efficient decentralized ecosystem, and create new opportunities for dApps and zkdApps.\\n\\nAs we stand today, the integration of zero-knowledge rollups into the Push Protocol is already ripe with potential, opening up a wealth of applications and enhancements. However, as we cast our gaze towards the horizon, the maturing landscape of zero-knowledge technology promises even more exciting opportunities for exploration and improvement within Push.\\n\\n## Future Developments & Experimentation\\n\\nThe evolutionary journey of zero-knowledge technology opens up avenues to explore new applications and improvements within Push Protocol. Recursive proofs, proof aggregation, and efficient proof generation are among the intriguing areas of ongoing research and experimentation.\\n\\n<b>Recursive proofs:</b> Recursive proofs can enhance the efficiency of Push Protocol by reducing the computational and storage requirements. This approach can also offer innovative methods to perform specific actions based on message data.\\n\\n<b>Proof aggregation:</b> Proof aggregation can significantly reduce the on-chain data footprint, thereby improving scalability and lowering associated costs.\\n\\n<b>Efficient proof generation:</b> Research and development to improve proof generation algorithms could pave the way for faster, more scalable communication in Push Protocol while preserving privacy.\\n\\n## Push & ZK in Action: Unveiling the Benefits of Integrating ZKR into Push\\n\\nIntegrating Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZKR) into Push Protocol offers diverse benefits in real-world applications. This section highlights key use cases where this integration significantly impacts the world of decentralized communication.\\n\\n### Decentralized finance and privacy-preserving transactions\\n\\nThe marriage of zero-knowledge tech and Push Protocol can create a foundation for privacy-preserving messages in DeFi applications. Furthermore, this integration facilitates secure, real-time communication between participants in DeFi ecosystems, enhancing user experience and trust.\\n\\n### IoT networks and data sharing\\n\\nIn the vast world of IoT networks, zero-knowledge techniques integrated with Push Protocol can ensure data privacy and security. It can also foster real-time communication and collaboration between devices.\\n\\n### Voting systems and governance\\n\\nThe synergy of zero-knowledge tech and Push Protocol can design secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving voting systems that shield voter identities and avert tampering.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIntegrating zero-knowledge tech into Push Protocol equips developers with a robust toolkit for designing privacy-centric, scalable, and efficient messaging solutions.

Unlike traditional chat systems tied to wallet addresses, Push NFT Chat allows chats to be specifically associated with individual NFTs owned by users. This is a game changer for chat integrations.\\n\\nWith Push NFT Chat, users now have the flexibility to choose whether their communications remain connected to their NFTs or their wallets.\\n\\nSo how does it all work?\\n\\n## Understanding Encryption Methodology of Push NFT Chat\\n\\nThe encryption methodology employed by Push Chat ensures secure and private communication while supporting the unique requirements of Push NFT Chat. Both Push Chat and Push NFT Chat rely on PGP keys which form the foundation for wallet-to-wallet communication. These keys are encrypted and stored on the Push Network, facilitating end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) universal inboxes.\\n\\nPush NFT Chat utilises a distinct encryption mechanism specifically tailored to support NFT chats. This approach combines security and versatility, allowing seamless integration with NFTs. The encryption process involves a three-pass encryption procedure for new users:\\n\\n1. A secret key is generated on the client side, automatically by the SDK, with the user having the option to choose the secret key if desired.\\n2. The generated secret key is then used to encrypt the locally generated PGP key on the client side.\\n3. Subsequently, the wallet encrypts the secret key itself, along with the encrypted PGP key. The encrypted versions of both the secret key and the PGP key are stored on the Push nodes.\\n\\nDespite the integration of NFT-specific features, the default behaviour of Push Chat remains intact. Users still sign in once to unlock their Push Profiles and initiate messaging. However, the updated implementation now offers support for chat and connection transfers when moving NFTs to different wallets.\\n\\nThis means, even if you move your NFT from one wallet to another, your chats still remain tied to that NFT. In the case of transferring ownership of your NFT, unless you give that new owner your password, they\u2019ll be required to create a new chat profile and hence be unable to access your previous chats tied to the NFT (more on ownership transfer in Step 5 of Getting Started).\\n\\nThis enhanced functionality ensures a seamless and continuous user experience while maintaining the security and privacy of communications.\\n\\nThe encryption methodology of Push Chat guarantees the protection of user data and enables the integration of NFTs into the communication framework, empowering users to securely connect and communicate in the context of their NFTs.\\n\\n## Getting Started with Push NFT Chat\\n\\nTo get started with Push NFT Chat, the easiest approach is to utilise the Push SDK package. This can be seamlessly integrated into your frontend to develop custom NFT-tied chat systems. Additionally, Push NFT Chat can be deployed in the backend to implement automated chatbots or systems.\\n\\nThis guide is designed to showcase the straightforward process of building an NFT chat system with Push NFT Chat. Despite the complexity of the underlying logic, the Push Protocol abstracts away the intricacies, making the implementation remarkably simple for developers.\\n\\nFor the purpose of this guide, we will walk through the process of writing a simple TypeScript script to send NFT-tied chat messages.\\n\\n## Step 1: Setting up the Environment\\n\\nTo begin, you need to set up your development environment.\\n\\nEnsure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Node.js, TypeScript and ts-node. Create a new project directory and initialise it with a package.json file. Install the Push SDK package which will fetch and install the required dependencies.\\n\\n```js\\n# create project directory\\nmkdir nft-chat-guide\\n# browse to project directory\\ncd nft-chat-guide\\n# Initialise the project\\nnpm init --y\\n# Install the dependencies\\nnpm install @pushprotocol/restapi@latest ethers@^5.6\\n# Create the main ts file\\ntouch index.ts\\n```\\n\\n<blockquote><i>Note: ethers is a peer dependency required by the restapi package</i></blockquote>\\n\\n## Step 2: Creating an NFT-Chat Profile\\n\\nBefore you can create an NFT-Chat profile, it is essential to have a wallet that owns an NFT. This ensures that you have a unique NFT to associate with your chat profile. You have the flexibility to choose from various options: you can utilise any NFT available or even create your own NFT contract and mint some NFTs specifically for this purpose.\\n\\n```js\\n# setup .env file to store private info safely\\ntouch .env\\nnpm install dotenv\\n# type definitions for nodeJs\\nnpm install --save @types/node\\n```\\n\\nInside index.ts add the following code to create a Push NFT chat profile.\\n\\n```js\\nimport { PushAPI } from \'@pushprotocol/restapi\'\\nimport { ENV } from \'@pushprotocol/restapi/src/lib/constants\'\\nimport * as dotenv from \'dotenv\'\\nimport { ethers } from \'ethers\'\\ndotenv.config()\\n\\n// using staging environment\\nconst env = ENV.STAGING\\n\\n/**\\n* Creates a Push NFT Profile\\n* @param signer - signer of wallet which owns the NFT\\n* @param account - NFT account\\n* @param password - password of NFT Profile\\n*/\\nconst PushAPI_nft_user_create = async (\\n signer: ethers.Signer,\\n account: string,\\n password: string\\n) => {\\n const response = await PushAPI.user.create({\\n   account,\\n   signer,\\n   env,\\n   additionalMeta: { NFTPGP_V1: { password } },\\n })\\n return response\\n}\\n\\nconst NFT_CHAT = async () => {\\n // private key of wallet holding the NFT\\n const nftHolderWalletPrivatekey1 = process.env.NFT_HOLDER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_1\\n const nftSigner1 = new ethers.Wallet(`0x${nftHolderWalletPrivatekey1}`)\\n // nft:eip155:${nftChainId}:${nftContractAddress}:${nftTokenId}\\n const nftAccount1 =\\n   \'nft:eip155:11155111:0x42af3147f17239341477113484752d5d3dda997b:2\'\\n // user preferred profile password\\n const nftProfilePassword1 = \'@PushNFTProfile#01\'\\n const pushProfile1 = await PushAPI_nft_user_create(\\n   nftSigner1,\\n   nftAccount1,\\n   nftProfilePassword1\\n )\\n console.log(pushProfile1)\\n}\\n\\nNFT_CHAT()\\n```\\n\\nBehind the scenes, the Push SDK handles the creation of data for your Push profile, incorporating verification proofs that are subsequently verified by the Push nodes. These verification proofs help establish the authenticity and integrity of your profile within the Push network.\\n\\nMoreover, the Push nodes play a crucial role in verifying the ownership of the NFT associated with your wallet on the blockchain. This verification process ensures that the NFT is genuinely owned by your wallet address, providing a secure and reliable connection between your NFT and your NFT-Chat profile.\\n\\n### Step 3: Sending messages to another Push Profile\\n\\nAn NFT-Push Chat Profile can send messages to another NFT-Push Profile or a wallet-based Push profile. In the following example, we would see how one NFT Profile can send a message to another NFT Profile.\\n\\n```js\\nimport { PushAPI } from \'@pushprotocol/restapi\';\\nimport { ENV } from \'@pushprotocol/restapi/src/lib/constants\';\\nimport * as dotenv from \'dotenv\';\\nimport { ethers } from \'ethers\';\\ndotenv.config();\\n\\n// using staging environment\\nconst env = ENV.STAGING;\\n\\nconst NFT_CHAT = async () => {\\n  /**\\n   * 1. PROFILE CREATIONS\\n   */\\n  // 1.1 Create PushProfile#1\\n  const nftSigner1 = new ethers.Wallet(\\n    `0x${process.env.NFT_HOLDER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_1}`\\n  );\\n  const nftAccount1 =\\n    \'nft:eip155:11155111:0x42af3147f17239341477113484752d5d3dda997b:2\';\\n  const nftProfilePassword1 = \'@PushNFTProfile#01\';\\n  const pushProfile1 = await PushAPI.user.create({\\n    account: nftAccount1,\\n    signer: nftSigner1,\\n    env,\\n    additionalMeta: { NFTPGP_V1: { password: nftProfilePassword1 } },\\n  });\\n  // 1.2 Create PushProfile#2\\n  const nftSigner2 = new ethers.Wallet(\\n    `0x${process.env.NFT_HOLDER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_2}`\\n  );\\n  const nftAccount2 =\\n    \'nft:eip155:11155111:0x42af3147f17239341477113484752d5d3dda997b:3\';\\n  const nftProfilePassword2 = \'@PushNFTProfile#02\';\\n  const pushProfile2 = await PushAPI.user.create({\\n    account: nftAccount2,\\n    signer: nftSigner2,\\n    env,\\n    additionalMeta: { NFTPGP_V1: { password: nftProfilePassword2 } },\\n  });\\n  /**\\n   * 2. SENDING MESSAGE FROM PROFILE#1 TO PROFILE#2\\n   */\\n  // 2.1 Decrypt keys for PushProfile#1\\n  const decryptedPGPPrivateKey = await PushAPI.chat.decryptPGPKey({\\n    encryptedPGPPrivateKey: pushProfile1.encryptedPrivateKey,\\n    account: nftAccount1,\\n    signer: nftSigner1,\\n  });\\n  // 2.2 send the actual message\\n  const response = await PushAPI.chat.send({\\n    messageContent: \\"Gm gm! It\'s me... Mario\\",\\n    messageType: \'Text\', // can be \\"Text\\" | \\"Image\\" | \\"File\\" | etc\\n    receiverAddress: nftAccount2,\\n    account: nftAccount1,\\n    pgpPrivateKey: decryptedPGPPrivateKey,\\n    env: env,\\n  });\\n  console.log(response);\\n};\\n\\nNFT_CHAT();\\n```\\n\\nIn the Push NFT Chat system, messages are encrypted using the PGP public key of the intended receiver. This encryption ensures that only the recipient\u2019s Push profile possesses the corresponding private key required to decrypt and access the chats. By utilizing PGP encryption, the security and confidentiality of the messages are upheld, providing a trusted communication channel.\\n\\nTo ensure decentralized storage and robust availability, the messages in Push NFT Chat are stored on IPFS. IPFS allows for distributed and peer-to-peer storage, ensuring that the messages are not reliant on a single central server. This decentralized storage approach enhances data resilience and availability, making the system more robust against failures or data loss.\\n\\nIn order to maintain a controlled and spam-free communication experience, when one Push profile attempts to send a message to another profile, it is delivered as an intent rather than a direct message. This means that the message is sent to the receiver as a request or proposal, requiring their approval before it is fully delivered and visible in their chat. This intent-based delivery system helps prevent spamming and unwanted messages, ensuring that the recipient has control over the content they receive.\\n\\n## Step 4: Getting chats, requests and approving intents\\n\\nContinuing from Step 3. we would now fetch all requests received by an NFT Profile and approve the intent.\\n\\n```js\\n\\n...\\n...\\n\\n /**\\n  * 3. GETTING ALL CHAT REQUESTS OF PUSHPROFILE#2\\n  */\\n // 3.1 Decrypt keys for PushProfile#2\\n const decryptedPGPPrivateKey2 = await PushAPI.chat.decryptPGPKey({\\n   encryptedPGPPrivateKey: pushProfile2.encryptedPrivateKey,\\n   account: nftAccount2,\\n   signer: nftSigner2,\\n })\\n // 3.2 Getting all requests or intents for PushProfile#2\\n const requests = await PushAPI.chat.requests({\\n   account: nftAccount2,\\n   toDecrypt: true, // to decrypt the received request messages\\n   pgpPrivateKey: decryptedPGPPrivateKey2,\\n   env: env,\\n })\\n console.log(requests)\\n // 3.3 Approve the request by PushProfile#2\\n await PushAPI.chat.approve({\\n   status: \'Approved\',\\n   senderAddress: requests[0].did, // push profile which sent the request ie nftAccount1\\n   account: nftAccount2,\\n   signer: nftSigner2,\\n   pgpPrivateKey: decryptedPGPPrivateKey2,\\n   env: env,\\n })\\n // 3.4 Fetching the chats of PushProfile#2\\n // After approval of intent, messages sent by PushProfile#1 will be visible in chats of PushProfile#2\\n const chats = await PushAPI.chat.chats({\\n   account: nftAccount2,\\n   toDecrypt: true, // to decrypt the received chat messages\\n   pgpPrivateKey: decryptedPGPPrivateKey2,\\n   env: env,\\n })\\n console.log(chats)\\n}\\n\\nNFT_CHAT()\\n```\\n\\n## Step 5: Transferring Chats on NFT transfer\\n\\nOn transferring an NFT the new NFT holder wallet has two choices:\\n\\n### 1. Starting as a fresh new Push Chat Profile with no previous history of past NFT owner chats.\\n\\n```js\\n...\\n...\\n /**\\n  * 4 PUSHPROFILE#1 TRANSFERRED NFT TO ANOTHER WALLET\\n  */\\n const newNftSigner1 = new ethers.Wallet(\\n   `0x${process.env.NEW_NFT_HOLDER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_1}`\\n )\\n const newNftProfilePassword1 = \'@NEWPushNFTProfile#01\'\\n // 4.1 New NFT Owner resets the Push NFT Profile\\n const newPushProfile1 = await PushAPI.user.create({\\n   account: nftAccount1,\\n   signer: newNftSigner1,\\n   env,\\n   additionalMeta: { NFTPGP_V1: { password: newNftProfilePassword1 } },\\n })\\n}\\n\\nNFT_CHAT()\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Continue with the chats of previous NFT owners.\\n\\n```js\\n...\\n...\\n  /**\\n  * 4 PUSHPROFILE#1 TRANSFERRED NFT TO ANOTHER WALLET\\n  */\\n const newNftSigner1 = new ethers.Wallet(\\n   `0x${process.env.NEW_NFT_HOLDER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_1}`\\n )\\n const newNftProfilePassword1 = \'@NEWPushNFTProfile#01\'\\n // 4.1 Decrypt the keys from password of the previous owner\\n const profile1DecryptedPGPPrivateKey = await PushAPI.chat.decryptPGPKey({\\n   encryptedPGPPrivateKey: pushProfile1.encryptedPrivateKey,\\n   account: nftAccount1,\\n   env: env,\\n   additionalMeta: {\\n     NFTPGP_V1: {\\n       password: nftProfilePassword1,\\n     },\\n   },\\n })\\n // 4.2 New NFT Owner continues with the Old Profile with re-encrypting keys with new Wallet\\n await PushAPI.user.auth.update({\\n   pgpPrivateKey: profile1DecryptedPGPPrivateKey,\\n   pgpEncryptionVersion: ENCRYPTION_TYPE.NFTPGP_V1,\\n   signer: newNftSigner1,\\n   pgpPublicKey: pushProfile1.publicKey,\\n   account: nftAccount1,\\n   env: env,\\n   additionalMeta: {\\n     NFTPGP_V1: {\\n       password: newNftProfilePassword1, //new nft profile password\\n     },\\n   },\\n })\\n}\\n\\nNFT_CHAT()\\n```\\n\\nContinuing the chats of the previous NFT owner requires the previous owner\u2019s password. This means that the previous owner of the NFT has the option to decide whether or not to hand over the password to the new NFT owner.\\n\\nWhen ownership of an NFT tied to a chat profile is transferred from one individual to another, the previous owner\u2019s password is necessary to maintain access to the ongoing chats associated with that NFT. This approach ensures that the new NFT owner does not automatically inherit access to the previous owner\u2019s private conversations without explicit authorization.\\n\\nBy giving control over the password transfer to the previous NFT owner, Push NFT Chat respects the privacy and consent of all parties involved. It provides a transparent process where the previous owner can choose to share or withhold the password, allowing for a seamless transition of NFT ownership while maintaining the security and confidentiality of the chat history.\\n\\n## Exploring Additional Capabilities of Push NFT Chat\\n\\n- [Creating Public / Private Groups for NFT Chat Profiles](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-sdk/blob/88bafe49d489cfe399efa7166407a50574995b16/packages/examples/sdk-backend-node/src/main.ts#L1390)\\n- [Listening to Chat Socket Events for NFT Chat Profiles](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-sdk/blob/88bafe49d489cfe399efa7166407a50574995b16/packages/examples/sdk-backend-node/src/main.ts#L1546)"},{"id":"june-monthly-recap","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/june-monthly-recap","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-04-push-recap-june-2023/index.md","title":"June Monthly Recap \ud83c\udf05","description":"Cover image of June Monthly Recap \ud83c\udf05","date":"2023-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 4, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Web3 Tools","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3-tools"}],"readingTime":2.6,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"june-monthly-recap","title":"June Monthly Recap \ud83c\udf05","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"What a month it\u2019s been at Push!

Built on the Ethereum layer 2 system StarkWare, dYdX leverages zero-knowledge proofs to provide enhanced security, decentralization, and privacy to its users.\\n\\nAt its core, dYdX is designed for trading perpetuals, which unlike traditional futures or options, do not have expiration dates. This allows traders to speculate on the future value of an underlying asset indefinitely. This unique offering has attracted both institutional and retail traders, making dYdX one of the most popular exchanges in the market.\\n\\nThe collaboration between dYdX and Push is a game-changer in the DeFi industry, empowering traders worldwide with powerful, transparent, and fair financial products. dYdX\u2019s mission to democratize access to financial opportunity aligns perfectly with Push\u2019s commitment to fostering transparency and communication. Together, dYdX and Push are working together to enhance accessibility and pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable financial future.\\n\\nIn this edition of \u201cFrens of Push,\u201d we had the privilege of interviewing Cliffton Lee, Governance and SEA Lead at dYdX. Join us as we delve into the inner workings of dYdX, learn how they\u2019re using Push\u2019s communication layer, and gain insights into the vision and goals that drive this innovative DeFi platform.\\n\\n### 1. Hi Cliffton, what\u2019s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\\n\\nMy name is Cliffton, and I work on all things Governance and Growth for the SEA region at the dYdX Foundation. I first got into crypto in 2017 when I purchased some BTC and ETH on Coinbase as an experiment, and it was only in 2020 that I went deep down the web3 rabbithole and deeply appreciated the importance of decentralized technologies, and how cryptography could enable that. I was drawn into Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, scalability strategies via rollups, and this was how I got involved with dYdX.\\n\\n### 2. Tell us about dYdX \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem does dYdX solve?\\n\\ndYdX is the leading decentralized crypto perpetuals trading exchange. dYdX\u2019s mission is to democratize access to financial opportunity. Few have access to advanced tools and products in the financial system, and dYdX believes in empowering more traders, in more places, with powerful, transparent, and fair financial products.\\n\\nWhile trading on dYdX, traders enjoy the security, privacy and decentralization benefits.\\ndYdX is currently built on top of StarkEx, a layer 2 zero knowledge rollup to Ethereum, and there is works ongoing to build the next version of dYdX v4. dYdX v4 will be fully decentralized end to end, and will be a layer 1 Proof-of-Stake blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK.\\n\\n### 3. How do developers use dYdX?\\n\\nDeveloper documentation: https://dydxprotocol.github.io/v3-teacher/#terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy\\n\\nThese docs describe the v3 API for the dYdX decentralized perpetual contracts exchange. The exchange runs on an L2 (layer-2) blockchain system, and operates independently of previous dYdX protocols and systems, including the v1 and v2 APIs.\\n\\nLike the previous iteration of dYdX perpetuals, the exchange uses a centralized order book, but remains non-custodial, and settles trades and liquidations in a trustless manner.\\n\\n### 4. What\u2019s the 2023 plan for dYdX and its ecosystem?\\n\\nThe main goal is to ship dYdX v4, and to enable the progressive decentralization of the protocol via governance.\\n\\n### 5. How is dYdX using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\ndYdX users currently use Push to get notified of governance updates. Currently, dYdX stakeholders can subscribe to receive notifications when:\\n\\n- A DRC is created\\n- The voting process for DRC begins\\n- A DIP is created\\n- The voting for the DIP is activated\\n- The DIP is queued\\n- The DIP is implemented\\n\\n### 6. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\nGreat! Community members have reached out mentioning that Push has been helpful in keeping them notified of what\u2019s happening on the governance front. We\u2019ve seen better engagement rates and higher vote participation.\\n\\n### 7. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\nWith dYdX moving to the Cosmos ecosystem, we\u2019re hoping that Push can be compatible with the Cosmos SDK to continue this notification functionality.\\n\\n## About dYdX\\n\\ndYdX is a DEX on Ethereum providing a transparent and secure financial ecosystem for crypto trading. With a focus on empowering traders, dYdX provides advanced trading features such as margin trading and perpetual swaps. The platform utilizes a traditional orderbook + matching model for trading and has emerged as one of the most popular DEXes in the market.\\n\\nLearn all about dYdX: [Website](https://dydx.exchange/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dydx), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Tuze6tY), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/dYdXprotocol), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dydxprotocol/), [github](https://github.com/dydxprotocol)"},{"id":"how-push-protocol-can-revolutionize-data-driven-decision-making","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/how-push-protocol-can-revolutionize-data-driven-decision-making","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-29-monitoring-analytics-real-time/index.md","title":"How Push Protocol Can Revolutionize Data-Driven Decision Making\ud83d\udcca","description":"Cover image of How Push Protocol Can Revolutionize Data-Driven Decision Making\ud83d\udcca","date":"2023-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 29, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Web3 Tools","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3-tools"},{"label":"Web3 Data Analytics","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3-data-analytics"},{"label":"Data Analytics","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/data-analytics"}],"readingTime":3.0433333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-push-protocol-can-revolutionize-data-driven-decision-making","title":"How Push Protocol Can Revolutionize Data-Driven Decision Making\ud83d\udcca","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"In today\u2019s fast-paced business environment, accessing and analyzing data in real-time is critical to making informed decisions.

Since then, NFTs have gained significant popularity, transforming how we perceive and interact with digital art, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more.\\n\\nHowever, as the NFT space evolved, it became apparent that the ERC-721 standard had certain limitations. For one, the ERC-721 was not compatible with smart contracts and dApps across Ethereum. Additionally, due to static JSON metadata, ERC-721 tokens are inflexible when it comes to Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) codes, security, and efficiency.\\n\\nRecognizing the need to address these limitations, and enable NFTs to evolve over time, a new standard had to be introduced. Enter the ERC-6551 standard!\\n\\n## Understanding ERC-6551\\n\\nERC-6551, also known as token-bound accounts (or TBA), builds upon the ERC-721 standard by introducing smart contract capabilities to NFTs.\\n\\nWhat does this mean?\\n\\nTBA creates a smart contract wallet for each ERC-721, allowing them to perform transactions, interact with other dApps, hold tokens or other NFTs, or serve as an on-chain identity. TBA is also backward compatible with the ERC-721 standard, meaning that ERC-721 tokens can implement the ERC-6551 standard without requiring any significant modifications.\\n\\n## How Does ERC-6551 Work?\\n\\nThe ERC-6551 standard leverages a permissionless registry that is compatible with existing ERC-721 tokens. This registry serves as a factory and directory for creating and managing token-bound accounts. By calling a function on the registry and paying a small fee, anyone can create a token-bound account for an ERC-721 token. The registry deploys a proxy contract that represents the token-bound account, inheriting all the properties and metadata of the original ERC-721 token.\\n\\nThe proxy contract incorporates the EIP-1271 standard, enabling the token-bound account to sign messages and verify signatures on behalf of the NFT. This capability empowers token-bound accounts to interact with other smart contracts, including any dApps on the Ethereum network.\\n\\n## What Are the Core Benefits of ERC-6551 in the NFT Space?\\n\\n1. Enhanced Composability\\n2. On-chain Interactivity\\n3. Trackable History\\n4. Metadata flexibility\\n\\n### Enhanced Composability\\n\\nERC-6551 allows for the bundling of NFTs with related assets, such as tokens or other NFTs, into a single profile. By consolidating tokens, assets, and NFTs within a single TBA, users can effortlessly transfer assets and seamlessly switch between platforms, greatly enhancing their experience.\\n\\n### On-chain Interactivity\\n\\nERC-6551 enables you to use your NFT address as your on-chain identity and hence interact with other on-chain smart contracts and dApps on the Ethereum network. All without relying on a wallet address.\\n\\n### Trackable History\\n\\nERC-6551 solves the problem of limited transaction history associated with traditional NFTs. With token-bound accounts, owners can obtain insights into an asset\u2019s transaction history and utility beyond simple proof of ownership. This transparency adds value to NFTs and fosters trust and confidence among collectors and creators.\\n\\nMoreover, based on an NFT\u2019s history, loyalty programs, in-game rewards, airdrops, and more can leverage this new functionality. For lending protocols, this could even facilitate the establishment of credit ratings in the future.\\n\\n### Metadata flexibility\\n\\nERC-721 NFTs have immutable JSON metadata. That is, once the NFT is minted the data can\u2019t be changed. Conversely, ERC-6551 NFTs leave room for additional data and values to be added on the token, making them infinitely more flexible.\\n\\n## Potential Use Case Example: In-game enhancements\\n\\nPrior to the introduction of ERC-6551, players could own their in-game characters as ERC-721 NFTs. However, the assets they collected within the game existed as separate tokens in their wallets.\\n\\nToken-bound accounts change this dynamic by allowing game developers to create \u201cinventories\u201d for players. This means that all game-related assets can be automatically transferred into the character\u2019s wallet, resulting in a smoother user experience. It also enables the creation of in-game user interfaces (UIs) that were previously challenging to implement.\\n\\nWhile this example is only one way ERC-6551 NFTs can be used, there are many more applications across DeFi, DAOs, and general web3 tools.\\n\\nTo read more about ERC-6551 EIP, you can do so here \ud83d\udc49 https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551\\n\\nBig congratulations and thank you to the team who helped author this incredible development: Jayden Windle, Benny Giang, Steve Jang, Druzy Downs, Raymond Huynh, Alanah Lam, Wilkins Chung, Paul Sullivan.\\n\\n## Pushing the Boundaries of ERC-6551 with Push NFT-to-NFT Chat\\n\\nIn addition to the release of ERC-6551, Push NFT Chat is also here, providing even more potential utility for NFTs.\\n\\nPush NFT Chat enables chats to be tied to a specific NFT owned by you, instead of a chat owned by a wallet address. Built as an extension of Push Chat, Push NFT Chat benefits from all the intuitive, user-centric features that Push Chat has while revolutionizing the way NFT holders interact.\\n\\nBy introducing web3 native NFT-to-NFT and dApp-to-NFT instant communication, we\u2019ll be adding to the suite of enhancements that the recently launched ERC-6551 is also bringing to NFTs in web3.\\n\\nMore info about Push NFT Chat \ud83d\udc49 https://push-protocol.medium.com/introducing-push-nft-chat-chats-and-comms-tied-to-your-nfts-done-right-98717c04438d\\n\\nERC-6551 might just be the dawn of a new era of NFTs. This game-changing standard is set to break free from the limitations of static assets, paving the way for dynamic, interconnected digital experiences. As we embrace this new paradigm, we embark on an exciting journey where NFTs shape the future of digital ownership.

It operates just the way Push chat operates for wallets and <b>includes all features you can find in Push chat</b> but with three main differences:\\n\\n- It uses triple encryption to ensure your chats are truly tied to an NFT and not a wallet alias.\\n- The address format for Push NFT Chat is <b>`nft:eip155:${nftChainId}:${nftContractAddress}:${nftTokenId}` instead of `eip155:${walletaddress}`</b> (used in wallet to wallet communication)\\n- Your communication moves with your NFT but only if you want them to\\n\\n![Push NFT Chat Image](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<i>Developer Hint</i>: Push NFT Chat is already out:\\n\\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/restapi#for-chat\\n\\n<i>Developer Hint</i>: This example repo covers all functionalities that can be implemented from the SDK:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/push-protocol/push-sdk/tree/main/packages/examples/sdk-backend-node\\n\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n## How does Push NFT Chat work?\\n\\nThe message abilities and features of Push NFT Chat are still based on PGP keys that power wallet-to-wallet Push Chat and are encrypted and stored on Push Network to enable an E2EE universal inbox. However, there are different features that enable Push NFT Chat, tie communication to the NFT, and validate it.\\n\\n### Encryption\\n\\nPush NFT Chat uses a different encryption mechanism to encrypt the PGP key. This is what makes it secure yet versatile to support NFT chats. Push NFT Chat uses three pass encryption and is done in the following way for a new user:\\n\\n- A secret key is randomly created for the user on client side, this is automated by SDK and invisible to the user though their are options available for a user to choose the secret key if they want.\\n- This secret key is then used to encrypt the PGP key generated locally on the client side.\\n- This secret key is then encrypted by the wallet of the user and the encrypted version of it and the encrypted PGP key is stored on the Push nodes.\\n\\nThis approach still results in the default behavior of signing once to unlock Push Profiles and start messaging, though it is now also capable of supporting chat and connections transfers when and if you move your NFT to another wallet.\\n\\nThis is enabled because of the three pass encryption which means your PGP keys can be decrypted and re-encrypted by a user if they have access to the secret key. Since the key itself is encrypted by the current wallet which holds that NFT, the decryption process doesn\u2019t require manually entering the secret key as wallet signing is used to derive the decrypted secret key.\\n\\nThis creates an intuitive UX where user is not hassled by the experience while still gaining the crucial feature of truly connecting their chats and connections with the NFT.\\n\\n## Address Format\\n\\nApart from the way encryption is handled, the NFT chat uses a different address format for communication owing to them having access to various NFTs from the same wallet. The address format is <b>`nft:eip155:${nftChainId}:${nftContractAddress}:${nftTokenId}`.</b>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n <i>For example:</i>Lens NFT Chat will result in the address format as nft:eip155:137:0xDb46d1Dc155634FbC732f92E853b10B288AD5a1d:44433\\n</blockquote>\\n\\nEach address format representing identifiers as follows:\\n\\n1. <b>`nft`</b> -> To segregate whether chat profile is for wallet or nft\\n2. <b>`eip155`</b> -> Identifier for all EVM chains as per CAIP10, in the future other blockchain identifiers (non-Ethereum ones) will also be supported\\n3. <b>`${\'nftChainId\'}`</b> -> Chain id on which the NFT is present, in case of Lens, it\u2019s on Polygon whose chain id is 137\\n4. <b>`${\'nftContractAddress\'}`</b> -> The contract address of the NFT, in case of Lens, it\u2019s contract address for NFT is 0xDb46d1Dc155634FbC732f92E853b10B288AD5a1d\\n5. <b>`${\'nftTokenId\'}`</b> -> The token id of the particular NFT held by the wallet of the user, in this example, we have taken that as 44433\\n\\n## Transferring the NFT\\n\\nThe key pair is encrypted by a secret key selected by the NFT holder. When the NFT holder decides to transfer the NFT to another user, two possible scenarios can occur:\\n\\n- In the first scenario, the original owner can choose to send the new owner the secret key. This allows the new owner to decrypt all the chat messages associated with the NFT. This option ensures the continuity of the chat messages within the NFT.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\nThe original owner doesn\u2019t have to remember or even decide this secret on creation as that can handled by the frontend or the SDK including encrypting it with your wallet (though the user is free to override it).\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n- In the second scenario, the new owner doesn\u2019t have a secret key at which point the NFT profile is created afresh. However, this means that the new owner will not have access to any previous chat messages linked to that NFT. This option prioritizes the security of the chat messages and ensures that no one else has access to them.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\nThese two options enable pure, native NFT chat that is truly tied to a user NFT without sacrificing the security or the ability of transferring communication and connections. Instead, giving the control back to the user to decide what they want to do with their communications that they did with their NFT.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n## Guide for Getting Started With Push NFT Chat\\n\\nTo integrate with Push NFT Chat, you can start by watching the live demo below.\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\", aspectRatio: \'56.25%\' }} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Im_5RRQyQP4\\" title=\\"Introducing Push NFT Chat | Live Demo\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\nBegin Building \ud83d\udc49 https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushpr...\\n\\nPush SDK Repo \ud83d\udc49 https://github.com/ethereum-push-noti...\\n\\nIf you need any help or support with integration, give us a shout out or tag us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ar8HkYNs)."},{"id":"enhancing-blockchain-based-games-ux-through-in-game-chat-notifications","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/enhancing-blockchain-based-games-ux-through-in-game-chat-notifications","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-05-enhance-blockchain-games-ux/index.md","title":"Enhancing Blockchain Based Games UX Through In-Game Chat + Notifications\ud83c\udfae","description":"Cover image of Enhancing Blockchain Based Games UX Through In-Game Chat + Notifications\ud83c\udfae","date":"2023-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"},{"label":"Blockchain Development","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-development"},{"label":"Web3 Game","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3-game"}],"readingTime":3.9966666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"enhancing-blockchain-based-games-ux-through-in-game-chat-notifications","title":"Enhancing Blockchain Based Games UX Through In-Game Chat + Notifications\ud83c\udfae","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Blockchain gaming has emerged as a rapidly growing niche within the gaming industry, driven by the unique benefits it offers players, including true ownership of in-game assets, interoperability between games, and provable scarcity of digital items.

Here\u2019s what we achieved in Phase 0:\\n\\n### Metagovernance\\n\\n- Implemented 4 roles with different capabilities to allow community members to participate in Push governance in a variety of ways. DAO members can vote directly in governance proposals or delegate their voting power to a delegate that represents their ideals.\\n- Learning from best practices from other successful DAOs, we created an efficient mechanism to enable faster implementation and execution of important proposals that got immediate traction within the community.\\n- Implemented PIPs (Push Improvement Proposals) to enable Push Protocol to work together with the community to form standardized, community-driven improvements, specs, and standards.\\n- PGIP (Push Governance Improvement Proposals) and rewards: intended to open the floor for contributors with suggestions to improve the Governance process. These come attached with rewards upon the successful ratification and implementation of proposals.\\n\\n### Push Grants Program\\n\\n- After the successful first Grants Program, we took the feedback from the grantees and the community and launched the Push Grants Program v2.0.\\n- PGPv2.0 enhances the companionship offered to projects and emphasizes a collaboration in which Projects grow hand by hand with Push \u2014 including guidance, mentorship, technical support, partnership intros, and more.\\n- As of April 2023, the [Push Grants Ecosystem](https://twitter.com/Push_DAO/status/1638221385288785926) is made of 27 projects. More applications are already in queue to be reviewed by the Push Grants Review Committee.\\n\\n### Other Supporting Initiatives\\n\\n- <b>Rockstars of Push:</b> With the success of the original Rockstars of EPNS campaign, we extended the program one more season with Rockstars of Push vol2. The program is almost half way through and more and more we receive submissions from hackers, media content producers, and Push community members in general.\\n- <b>Push Bug Bounty Program:</b> Approved via governance to allow community members and security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities in our systems\\n\\n## Enter Push DAO Phase 1\\n\\nIn the next phase of the Push DAO, we\u2019ll focus on setting the foundation to achieve sufficient decentralization (community ownership). By building the Push DAO in a modular fashion over time, we intend to empower our community to work on initiatives that further the goals of the organization.\\n\\n<b>Push DAO phase 1 highlights:</b>\\n\\n- Official Start Date: April 3rd, 2023\\n- Push Ambassadors Program v1.0\\n- Community-Managed Push Grants Program\\n- Open the floor for Push Contributors\\n- DAO infrastructure\\n\\n### Push Ambassadors Program v1.0\\n\\nThe Push Ambassadors Program kicked-off phase 1 of the Push Decentralization Roadmap on April 3rd, 2023.\\n\\n- Initial focus on LATAM and Spanish-speaking communities\\n- Marketing objective: Brand awareness. With content production in various platforms and formats.\\n- Create a replicable Ambassadors Program that can be installed in other communities.\\n\\nThis program will run in the paid contributor modality, where the ambassadors will be the first official community contributors to the Push DAO. This comes together with contributor reputation and other important DAO activities that need to happen to build an effective, efficient, and decentralized DAO.\\n\\n### Community-managed Push Grants Program\\n\\nLessons learned during this second iteration of the Push Grants Program will be implemented for future editions to improve even more the program and maximize the benefit for the grantees. The process is now being fine-tuned to have minimal social coordination cost and enable the program to be managed by a <b>Grants Workstream</b>.\\n\\nMore details will be shared as we advance towards completing this goal!\\n\\n### Open the floor for Push Contributors\\n\\nThis will be an ongoing process that will happen slowly through the rest of the year in a controlled fashion, where the team will work closely with the contributors.\\n\\nSlowly giving control of the work streams to the community, and more important making sure all governance infrastructure and procedures are in place to empower the community and each work stream to operate, grow, and take decisions.\\n\\nThis will include the gradual influence of the Push DAO over earmarked PUSH allocation. The funds set aside for the Push DAO will eventually be entirely controlled by the DAO, and allocated towards initiatives voted on and approved through on-chain governance. This could include event sponsorships, developer grants, marketing initiatives, and more. The Community Fund, which currently sits with the Push Protocol entity, can choose to fund the Push DAO fund with more PUSH as requested from the DAO.\\n\\n<center> <b>.   .   .</b></center>\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nThe focus of Governance Phase 1 is to lay the foundation that will help accelerate our 2024 plan of becoming a 100% community owned project.\\n\\nAs we continue making progress, we are looking to engage in more DAO-to-DAO collaboration opportunities, and make more work streams available for the DAO (moderation, governance, engineering, and more).\\n\\nThis will help us to realize our Push DAO vision of creating the necessary frameworks and tools to enable all forms of communication for everyone in web3 at a protocol level in a permissionless and seamless way.\\n\\nAs well as our Push DAO mission of revolutionizing the web3 UX by ensuring wallets, protocols and all web3 services are able to communicate via notifications, chats, video calls or more via a open and secure network.\\n\\nWe are excited about all the opportunities ahead and we are happy to continue BUIDLing and PUSHing together."},{"id":"push-protocol-v2-fee-pool-and-incentivized-chats-are-here","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-protocol-v2-fee-pool-and-incentivized-chats-are-here","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-31-push-v2/index.md","title":"Push Protocol v2 \u2014 Fee Pool & Incentivized Chats are here!","description":"Cover image of Push Protocol v2 \u2014 Fee Pool & Incentivized Chats are here!","date":"2023-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 31, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Liquidity Pool","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/liquidity-pool"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"},{"label":"Blockchain Development","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-development"}],"readingTime":8.326666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-protocol-v2-fee-pool-and-incentivized-chats-are-here","title":"Push Protocol v2 \u2014 Fee Pool & Incentivized Chats are here!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Push Protocol is thrilled to announce the successful completion of the security audit conducted by Chainsafe for our smart contracts version 2.

This milestone signifies a significant step forward in ensuring the robustness and reliability of our platform.\\n\\n## Key Takeaways\\n\\n1. The two main features introduced in version 2 of our smart contracts are:\\n\\n   - <b>Push Fee Pool Staking</b>\\n   - <b>Incentivized Chat Requests</b>\\n\\n2. With the launch of v2, the protocol aims to not only enhance the utility of the PUSH token but also enable an incentivization mechanism from the protocol level for all its users.\\n\\n3. $PUSH token holders shall now be able to earn incentives directly from the protocol. $PUSH tokens time based rewards multiplier also comes live. ie: the longer you have held the tokens, the higher your rewards will be.\\n\\n4. The design of v2 contracts ensures that the incentives for users are directly tied to the protocol. As the protocol expands its boundaries, the incentives for users that can be claimed from the contracts increase. <b><i>This implies that the more the protocol grows, the better the incentives become for users</i></b>.\\n\\n5. <b>Incentivized Push Chat</b> is a new feature introduced with version 2, that allows users to set a one-time fee for receiving chat requests. With the introduction of this feature, users will not only <b><i>gain enhanced control over incoming chat requests but also embark on a novel avenue for passive earnings</i></b>.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\n- Push Protocol v2 tentative launch date is late June, 2023 along with [yield farming v2 for fee pool and Uniswap v2 LP pool](https://snapshot.org/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=RockstarsOfPushWeek17%2618Post#/pushdao.eth/proposal/0x54092053eff30c3c304e45b575881945192e710bc9b3914bfe1d1eadcda3f114).\\n- This marks the beginning of [protocol fees](https://comms.push.org/docs/tokenomics/deepdive/$push/#push-fee-pool) incentivizing and rewarding token holders and crypto wallets.\\n- Push v2 has cleared Chainsafe audit. However, owing to the core and critical features of v2, the team has decided to launch it after 4 weeks.\\n- This gives team enough time to run white hat contests among major platform(s) to ensure v2 is battle tested.\\n- Prior to the tentative launch in late June, 2023, there will be an open, incentivized bug bounty program available to the community. More information coming soon.\\n\\nTime to dive deeper and understand the core features of Push v2 smart contracts and what it enables for web3 communication.\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n## Push Fee Pool Staking\\n\\nThe most significant feature of core v2 is the Push Fee Pool Staking.\\n\\nIn simple terms, this means PUSH holders can now stake and earn PUSH rewards directly from the core contract itself. As the protocol grows, so do the rewards.\\n\\n### What\u2019s the Fee Pool?\\n\\nBefore delving into how the Core v2 staking works, let\u2019s take a step back to quickly recap the concept of the Protocol Fee Pool.\\n\\nProtocol Feel Pool was introduced in the Version 1.5 of Push smart contracts. Fee Pool is a term used to signify small fees charged by the protocol actions like channel creation, channel reactivation, channel detail modification. They don\u2019t affect users and for users, everything is always feeless, with the exception of few features for super users as [outlined here](https://comms.push.org/docs/tokenomics/deepdive/$push/#push-fee-pool).\\n\\nIn other words, for every crucial transaction on the Core contract, it takes a small fee amount and stores it in what we call a <b>Push Fee Pool</b>.\\n\\nThe protocol fee is currently set to be equal to <b>10 PUSH tokens</b>. This value, however, can be changed by the community later using on-chain governance.\\n\\n<blockquote><i><b>Note:</b> This is not an additional fee that is charged on top of channel creation fees. Instead, the protocol fee is simply deducted from the same amount that a channel creator chooses to stake in the protocol.\\nFor example, if you chose to stake 50 PUSH during channel creation, 10 of those 50 PUSH tokens go into Protocol Fee Pool, while the remaining goes into Channel Pool Funds that are claimable by channel owners anytime they choose to deactivate their channel.*\\nRead more about Fee Pool and how it operates over here: https://comms.push.org/docs/tokenomics/deepdive/$push/#push-fee-pool.</i></blockquote>\\n\\n## The Fee Pool Staking\\n\\nWith the introduction of [version 1.5 of the core contract](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-push-protocol-v1-5-80eb39b55424), we laid the foundation for the fee pool and the vision of incentivizing PUSH holders. However, the current version represents a substantial leap towards realizing this vision.\\n\\nThe fundamental concept behind the introduction of the fee pool in v1.5 of our contracts was to establish an incentivization mechanism at the protocol level. This mechanism enables both PUSH token holders and protocol users to directly earn incentives from the protocol itself.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that as the protocol expands its boundaries, the incentives available for users to claim from the contracts also improve. This eventually means that the more the protocol grows, the better the incentives for users. The direct correlation between protocol growth and user incentives creates a mutually beneficial relationship within the ecosystem.\\n\\nThe Version 2 of the Core contracts includes <b>Stake and Claim functionalities that allow $PUSH token holders to stake their tokens in the core contract and earn rewards from the fee pool directly</b>.\\n\\n### Details about Core V2 Staking\\n\\n- The staking mechanism in core v2 is technically epoch-based staking. The entire distribution of rewards is split into epochs during which the users can stake and rewards can be accumulated.\\n- Each epoch is <b>~21 days long or 3 weeks long</b>.\\n- $PUSH token holders can stake their tokens at any given time in the core v2 contract.\\n- $PUSH had time weightage built in the token which also goes live with this update. This means that people who have held push longer are rewarded more the longer they stake.\\n- The total rewards available and claimable in an epoch mainly rely on the protocol\u2019s fee pool, i.e., the amount earned by the protocol itself. The more push tokens accumulated by the protocol during an epoch, the more rewards for the stakers of that specific epoch.\\n- The total rewards are also [bootstrapped with yield farming for the next 84 weeks](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-dao-extends-liquidity-rewards-program-26008926b05a) after the protocol goes live.\\n- The staking algorithm doesn\u2019t impose any lock-in period. This means holders are free to stake or un-stake whenever they wish.\\n- While no lock-in period is imposed, there is a delay period of at least one epoch before a user can withdraw or harvest. This means that any stake during a current epoch will require the user to at least wait T+1 epoch before they can claim rewards or withdraw their harvest. This is done to ensure bad actors can\u2019t misuse epoch duration for unfair rewards.\\n- When it comes to harvesting rewards from the contract, users shall be capable of harvesting rewards for all the epochs in which they were staked. <b><i>This basically means the longer a user stakes, the more rewards they should be able to harvest</i></b>.\\n- An important pointer that must be noted here is users cannot claim their rewards for the current epoch. For instance, if a user stakes at epoch 1 and tries to claim at epoch 6 <b>(which is the current epoch)</b>, they should be able to claim for epochs 1 to 5. This is because epoch 6 is currently active, and the contract doesn\u2019t allow claiming rewards from a current epoch.\\n\\n## Incentivized Push Chat\\n\\nWhile Push Chat has been bridging the communication gap of the entire web3 world, with the launch of our v2 contracts, we are introducing a new concept called <b>Incentivized Push Chat</b>.\\n\\nA brief glance at the current working mechanism of Push Chat shows us that any valid wallet address <b>(message sender)</b> can send a chat request to any other wallet address <b>(message receiver)</b>.\\n\\nAny new chat request sent by the sender simply lands under the <b>requests</b> tab of the receiver. And, the receiver can open, accept and respond to any chat request whenever he/she wants.\\n\\nHowever, in our continuous efforts to empower Push Chat users, we are enhancing the control they have over incoming chat requests. We believe that users should have the autonomy to determine and implement their own rules for handling these requests effectively.\\n\\nTo facilitate this, we will be introducing different types of settings within Push Chat:\\n\\n- <b>Open:</b> This setting allows unrestricted chat requests from anyone, giving users the flexibility to engage with a wide range of individuals.\\n- <b>Blacklisted:</b> By selecting this setting, users have the ability to block incoming chat requests from everyone, ensuring a more private and exclusive chat experience.\\n- <b>Incentivized Chat Requests:</b> With this setting, users can opt to enable a one-time fee for sending chat requests. This provides an opportunity for users to monetize their chat interactions and add value to each conversation.\\n\\n<blockquote><i><b>Note:</b> While the incentivized chat feature is being designed and developed to support multi-chain, for this specific version of the protocol, Incentivized Chat shall only support the Ethereum chain. Multi-chain support will be released with the upcoming versions of the protocol.</i></blockquote>\\n\\n### Deep diving into Incentivized Push Chat.\\n\\nIncentivized Push Chat introduces an innovative chat setting that empowers users to customize their experience by implementing a one-time fee <b>(in PUSH Tokens)</b> for individuals who wish to send them Push chat requests. By enabling this setting, users can ensure that anyone interested in initiating a push chat request must first deposit the specified fee before sending their message.\\n\\nThis feature grants users greater control over their chat interactions and enables them to monetize their engagement on the platform. In simpler terms, this innovative functionality empowers users to not just manage their chat interactions but also unlock new opportunities for generating income effortlessly. We feel this has great usage in driving creator economy and unleashing a new way for web3 communications to occur.\\n\\n<blockquote><i><b>Note:</b> Incentivized Chat Request only gives the sender the right to communicate to the receiver under chat request. The receiver still needs to accept the request to enable notifications and chat features. Ie. The receiver can still reject your messages while keeping the fee.</i></blockquote>\\n\\n### Brief glance at its Working Mechanism\\n\\nConsider two different users: <b>Message Sender & Message Receiver</b>\\n\\n### Enabling Incentivized Chat Request\\n\\n- It all begins with the <b>message receiver</b> selecting the Incentivized Push Chat setting for himself/herself.\\n- As they opt for these settings, they must select the minimum amount of Push Tokens that any chat request sender must pay to be able to send chat requests to the receiver.\\n\\n<blockquote><i><b>Note:</b> In alignment with our smart contract\u2019s design, it should be noted that a very nominal portion of this fee, specifically 10 PUSH tokens, is allocated to the Protocol Pool Fee.</i></blockquote>\\n\\n- Once this setting is enabled, the protocol guarantees that the recipient will only receive a chat request if the sender complies with the requirement of paying the specified amount of PUSH tokens.\\n\\n### Depositing Required Fee for Sending Chat Requests\\n\\n- Now it\u2019s time to look from a message sender\u2019s perspective.\\n- As a sender, you will be shown the minimum amount of PUSH tokens that must be deposited to interact with users with incentivized chat requests enabled.\\n- Therefore, the first step as a sender is to initiate the required fee payment and send the chat request right after. This boils down to one single function call from the Push Communicator contract, i.e., createIncentivizeChatRequest which handles all of it for the request sender.\\n- Upon successful completion of this transaction, chat requests will be sent to the recipient, facilitating the establishment of a communication bridge between the two users upon acceptance of the request.\\n\\n### Multi-Chain Fee Deposits and Bridging\\n\\n- With Push Protocol\u2019s expansion into multiple chains such as Polygon, BSC, and more, we have meticulously designed this feature to minimize any friction for users across these chains, ensuring a seamless experience beyond just Ethereum.\\n- Therefore, as mentioned earlier, the creation of incentivized chat requests is incorporated within our communicator contract, which, unlike our core contract, is deployed across multiple EVM chains.\\n- This essentially means users of any chain that is supported by Push Protocol can create incentivized chat requests from their respective chain itself, without the need to do the same from the Ethereum network.\\n\\n### Bridging:\\n\\n- It must be noted that users can create incentivized chat requests from any chain and deposit the push tokens on that chain\u2019s communicator itself.\\n- However, as per our contract\u2019s design, any incoming fund must be handled and stored in the core contract that lies on Ethereum.\\n- Therefore, any Push tokens deposited on communicator contracts of other EVM chains (supported by Push Protocol) shall essentially be bridged to the core contract which lies on the Ethereum chain itself.\\n- In order to ensure the bridging procedure is handled adequately, we will be using the Wormhole interoperability protocol for the cross-chain movement of the tokens.\\n\\n### Claiming Chat Incentives\\n\\n- As a final step, the core contract shall allow any user to claim their chat incentives directly from the core v2 contract on the Ethereum network.\\n- It should be noted that while users from any supported chain can create incentivized chat requests and deposit PUSH tokens, the tokens are essentially bridged and moved to the core contract on the Ethereum network.\\n- Therefore, it\u2019s extremely easy for the message or request <b>receivers</b> to simply pull out their claimable funds directly from the core contract itself, instead of jumping from one chain to another.\\n\\n## Why Incentivized Push Chat?\\n\\nThe Incentivized Push Chat feature offers several potential use cases that can benefit users in various ways.\\n\\n### Creator Economy / Monetization:\\n\\n- Professionals, Thought leaders, or experts in Web3 or any specific field can utilize the incentivized chat feature to monetize their knowledge and provide personalized advice or consultations through Push chat.\\n- This can drive the growing web3 creator economy and can enable web3 social to have various features that are currently not present in web2.\\n\\n### Spam Prevention:\\n\\n- While Push already has state of the art anti-spam features enabling users to accept chat first before they can be notified and / or have access to features like video calling, etc. Incentivized push requests takes it further for popular wallets who now can have a way to even prioritize their Push chat requests.\\n- The fee acts as a deterrent for low-quality or irrelevant requests, ensuring that users receive more meaningful and valuable messages.\\n\\n### Enhanced privacy and exclusivity:\\n\\n- The one-time fee requirement adds an extra layer of exclusivity and privacy for users. It can deter casual or unwanted interactions, ensuring that users only receive requests from individuals who are genuinely interested and willing to invest in the conversation.\\n- It can be particularly valuable for influencers or public figures who want to manage their interactions and maintain a more selective and focused engagement with their audience.\\n\\n<blockquote><b>Note:</b> Version 2 of the Push Core and Communicator smart contracts will be deployed in the next few weeks. All the above-mentioned new features will come into effect post the deployment.</blockquote>"},{"id":"taking-dao-communication-to-new-heights-push-x-aragon","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/taking-dao-communication-to-new-heights-push-x-aragon","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-30-push-aragon-dao-communication/index.md","title":"Taking DAO Communication to New Heights | Push x Aragon\ud83e\udd85","description":"Cover image of Taking DAO Communication to New Heights | Push x Aragon\ud83e\udd85","date":"2023-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Partnerships","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/partnerships"},{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Blockchain Development","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-development"},{"label":"Aragon","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/aragon"}],"readingTime":1.66,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"taking-dao-communication-to-new-heights-push-x-aragon","title":"Taking DAO Communication to New Heights | Push x Aragon\ud83e\udd85","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.gif","text":"We are thrilled to announce that Aragon, the premier DAO creation and management platform, is joining forces with Push to provide users with enhanced functionalities and seamless communication\ud83c\udf89 ","tags":["Web3","Partnerships","Push Protocol","Blockchain Development","Aragon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Push Protocol v2 \u2014 Fee Pool & Incentivized Chats are here!","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-protocol-v2-fee-pool-and-incentivized-chats-are-here"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to Create a Decentralized Reputation System with Alchemy and Push Protocol \u2705","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/how-to-create-a-decentralized-reputation-system-with-alchemy-and-push-protocol"}},"content":"![Cover image of Taking DAO Communication to New Heights | Push x Aragon\ud83e\udd85](./cover-image.gif)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWe are thrilled to announce that Aragon, the premier DAO creation and management platform, is joining forces with Push to provide users with enhanced functionalities and seamless communication\ud83c\udf89\\n\\nAragon\u2019s suite of applications and services makes it easy to create a DAO, customize it, and deploy it on the Ethereum network in just a few clicks.

We will explore the benefits these tools offer and provide a step-by-step guide on the development process. Additionally, we\u2019ll examine how to utilize Push Protocol for decentralized messaging to improve communication and collaboration within your dApp ecosystem.\\n\\nFinally, we\u2019ll share valuable tips and best practices for designing a successful reputation system that benefits all participants, fostering a vibrant and resilient environment for users, developers, and stakeholders. By grasping the nuances of decentralized reputation systems and leveraging Alchemy and Push Protocol, you\u2019ll be poised to develop an innovative, trustworthy, and impactful solution for the decentralized world.\\n\\n## Overview of Reputation Systems\\n\\nReputation systems are mechanisms designed to assess and quantify the trustworthiness, reliability, or quality of entities, such as users or services within a given network. These mechanisms rely on factors such as past performance, user ratings, reviews, and other relevant data points to establish an individual\u2019s or an organization\u2019s reputation score. This score then serves as a reference for other participants when making decisions, such as choosing a service provider or engaging in a transaction.\\n\\nHere are some examples of reputation systems commonly used today:\\n\\n- Amazon Seller Rating: Amazon assigns a rating to each seller based on factors such as shipping time, order accuracy, and customer service. Buyers can use this rating to evaluate a seller\u2019s reputation before making a purchase.\\n- Airbnb Host Rating: Airbnb uses a rating system to assess the reliability and quality of hosts based on factors such as communication, cleanliness, and accuracy of listing descriptions. This rating can help potential guests decide whether to book a listing or not.\\n- Uber Driver Rating: Uber\u2019s rating system allows passengers to rate their driver after a trip based on factors such as driving skills, punctuality, and professionalism. These ratings can help future riders decide which driver to select for their next trip.\\n\\nIn each of these examples, the reputation system assigns a score or rating to a participant based on their behavior and interactions within the platform. This score can then be used by other participants to evaluate the trustworthiness, reliability, or quality of the individual or organization.\\n\\nUnlike traditional centralized reputation system which can be subject to biased or unreliable information due to their inherent limitations, decentralized reputation systems provide a more transparent and equitable approach. These systems play a critical role in empowering users and developers in the decentralized ecosystem by establishing trust and credibility based on the actions, history, and behavior of participants.\\n\\n## Decentralized Reputation Systems\\n\\nJust as centralized reputation systems do in web2, decentralized reputation systems allows users to establish trust and credibility within a blockchain-based web3 ecosystem. Decentralized reputation systems can be used in various contexts, such as peer-to-peer marketplaces, decentralized lending platforms, and social networks. The key benefits of decentralized reputation systems include the following:\\n\\n- Enhanced trust and transparency through the use of blockchain technology.\\n- Reduced reliance on centralized authorities for reputation management.\\n- The ability to leverage decentralized messaging for real-time reputation updates and notifications\\n\\n## Step-by-Step Guide For Building a Decentralized Reputation System with Alchemy and Push Protocol\\n\\n1. Designing Smart Contracts\\n2. Building a User Interface\\n3. Integrating with Alchemy and Push Protocol\\n\\n## 1. Designing Smart Contracts\\n\\nTo create the foundation for your decentralized reputation system, you\u2019ll need to develop smart contracts that handle:\\n\\n- User registration and identity management.\\n- Reputation scoring, based on criteria such as transaction history and user feedback.\\n- The storage and retrieval of reputation data on the blockchain.\\n\\nYou can write your smart contracts using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), and thoroughly test them with tools like [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) and [Remix](https://remix-project.org/).\\n\\nHere\u2019s an example of a simple decentralized reputation system using a Solidity smart contract:\\n\\n```js\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\ncontract DecentralizedReputationSystem {\\n    struct UserProfile {\\n        address userAddress;\\n        uint256 reputation;\\n        string name;\\n    }\\n\\n    mapping(address => UserProfile) public userProfiles;\\n    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public feedbackGiven;\\n\\n    event NewUserRegistered(address userAddress, string name);\\n    event FeedbackReceived(address from, address to, uint256 reputationDelta);\\n\\n    function registerUser(string memory _name) public {\\n        require(userProfiles[msg.sender].userAddress == address(0), \\"User already registered\\");\\n\\n        UserProfile memory newUserProfile = UserProfile({\\n            userAddress: msg.sender,\\n            reputation: 0,\\n            name: _name\\n        });\\n\\n        userProfiles[msg.sender] = newUserProfile;\\n        emit NewUserRegistered(msg.sender, _name);\\n    }\\n\\n    function giveFeedback(address _to, uint256 _reputationDelta) public {\\n        require(userProfiles[msg.sender].userAddress != address(0), \\"User not registered\\");\\n\\n        require(userProfiles[_to].userAddress != address(0), \\"Feedback recipient not registered\\");\\n\\n        require(!feedbackGiven[msg.sender][_to], \\"Feedback already given\\");\\n\\n        userProfiles[_to].reputation += _reputationDelta;\\n        feedbackGiven[msg.sender][_to] = true;\\n        emit FeedbackReceived(msg.sender, _to, _reputationDelta);\\n    }\\n\\n    function getUserReputation(address _user) public view returns (uint256) {\\n        require(userProfiles[_user].userAddress != address(0), \\"User not registered\\");\\n        return userProfiles[_user].reputation;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis smart contract defines a simple reputation system with the following features:\\n\\n- User registration: Users can register themselves with a name using the registerUser function. Each user is identified by their Ethereum address.\\n- User feedback: Registered users can provide feedback to other registered users by invoking the giveFeedback function. This function increases the reputation of the recipient user by the specified amount. Users can only give feedback to another user once.\\n- User reputation: The getUserReputation function can be called to retrieve the reputation of a registered user.\\n\\nWhen applying this to real-world scenarios, it\u2019s essential to consider integrating advanced features like confining feedback to interactions within the system, introducing reputation decay, or establishing dispute resolution mechanisms. Additionally, opting for a more refined token-based system can streamline the tracking and management of reputation scores.\\n\\n### Integrating Gitcoin Passport for Identity Management\\n\\nIn addition to designing smart contracts for user registration and identity management, integrating Gitcoin Passport can significantly enhance your decentralized reputation system.\\n\\nGitcoin Passport is a decentralized identity solution that allows users to create and manage their online identities across multiple dApps. By using Gitcoin Passport, you can take advantage of its built-in features, such as user verification, data portability, and seamless integration with other dApps.\\n\\nTo integrate Gitcoin Passport, follow the [official documentation](https://www.gitcoin.co/passport) and explore resources available in the Gitcoin ecosystem.\\n\\n## 2. Building a User Interface\\n\\nDevelop a user-friendly interface that allows users to:\\n\\n- Register and manage their profiles.\\n- View the reputation scores of other users.\\n- Provide feedback and rate other users based on their interactions.\\n\\nPopular frontend frameworks, such as [React](https://react.dev/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/), can be used to build your user interface. Integrate [Web3.js](https://web3js.org/#/) or [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) libraries to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nAs you develop the user interface for your decentralized reputation system, integrate Gitcoin Passport to handle user registration and authentication.

We will shed light on the numerous advantages that these sophisticated tools offer and provide a thorough, step-by-step guide of the development process. Lastly, we will share invaluable tips for constructing a successful analytics dashboard and elevating user experience.\\n\\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Real-Time Analytics Dashboard with Alchemy and Push Protocol\\n\\n1. Set Up the Backend and Dependencies.\\n2. Integrate Alchemy and Initialize Push Protocol.\\n3. Design a Dashboard.\\n4. Listen to New Blocks and Fetch Transaction Data.\\n5. Update the Dashboard UI.\\n6. Receive Real-Time Transaction Updates\\n\\n## 1. Setting Up the Backend and Dependencies\\n\\nTo build the backend for your real-time analytics dashboard, follow these steps:\\n\\n- Set up a frontend web application using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.\\n- Install and configure the necessary dependencies, including the Alchemy SDK\\n\\n```js\\nnpm install ethers @alchemy/alchemy-web3\\n\\nnpm install ethers @pushprotocol/restapi @pushprotocol/socket\\n```\\n\\n## 2. Integrating the Alchemy SDK & Initializing Push Protocol\\n\\nIntegrate [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/signup/?a=push-protocol) as your Ethereum node provider for faster and more reliable access to the blockchain data. Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/) for more details.\\n\\nHere is a sample workflow to integrate Alchemy:\\n\\n- Create an Alchemy account and obtain your API key.\\n- Replace your Ethereum node URL with your Alchemy API endpoint\\n\\n```js\\nimport { ethers } from \'ethers\';\\n\\nconst alchemyApiKey = \'your_alchemy_api_key\';\\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider(\'mainnet\', alchemyApiKey);\\n```\\n\\nNow, we can initialize Push Protocol. Follow the [official documentation](https://comms.push.org/docs/) for more details. The official PUSH-SDK packages are also available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/~pushprotocol).\\n\\nHere is a sample workflow to integrate Push Protocol:\\n\\n```js\\nimport { PushRestApiClient } from \'@pushprotocol/restapi\';\\nimport { PushSocketClient } from \'@pushprotocol/socket\';\\n\\nconst pushRestApiClient = new PushRestApiClient({\\n  applicationId: \'your_application_id\',\\n  applicationToken: \'your_application_token\',\\n});\\n\\nconst pushSocketClient = new PushSocketClient({\\n  applicationId: \'your_application_id\',\\n  applicationToken: \'your_application_token\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## 3. Designing a Dashboard\\n\\nDesign a user-friendly dashboard that provides relevant real-time analytics for blockchain transactions. Consider including:\\n\\n- A summary of key metrics, such as transaction count, average gas price, and transaction volume.\\n- A list of recent transactions with relevant details like transaction hash, sender, recipient, and value.\\n- Interactive charts displaying trends in transaction volume, gas prices, and other metrics over time.\\n- Filters and search functionality to help users easily navigate the data\\n\\nPopular frontend frameworks, such as [React](https://react.dev/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/), can be used to build your user interface. Integrate [Web3.js](https://web3js.org/#/) or [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) libraries to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nTo quickly spin up a Next.js-based Web3-ready dApp with an integrated components library, check out <a href=\\"https://createweb3dapp.alchemy.com/\\"><b>Alchemy\u2019s Create Web3 DApp</b></a> tool. This resource is fully open-source and designed to help users get started with building their dApps.\\n\\n## 4. Listening to New Blocks and Fetching Transaction Data\\n\\nCreate a function that listens to new blocks and fetches transaction data:\\n\\n```js\\nconst { Alchemy, Network } = require(\'alchemy-sdk\');\\n\\nconst alchemyConfig = {\\n  apiKey: \'your_alchemy_api_key\',\\n  network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,\\n};\\n\\nconst alchemy = new Alchemy(alchemyConfig);\\n\\nasync function listenToNewBlocks() {\\n  alchemy.core.on(\'block\', async (getBlockNumber) => {\\n    const block = await alchemy.core.getBlockWithTransactions(getBlockNumber);\\n    const transactions = block.transactions;\\n    // Process the transactions and update the dashboard\\n    updateDashboard(transactions);\\n    // Emit a real-time event through Push Protocol for connected clients\\n    await pushRestApiClient.emit(\'transactions\', { transactions });\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nlistenToNewBlocks(); // Invoke the function when the application starts\\n```\\n\\nIn this implementation, we import and set up the Alchemy SDK. Then, we modify the <b>listenToNewBlocks()</b> function to use the <b>alchemy.core.onBlock()</b> method to listen for new blocks and <b>alchemy.core.getBlockWithTransactions()</b> method to fetch transaction data.\\n\\nFor more advanced users, you can consider using custom webhooks. Custom webhooks offer several benefits in this scenario, including:\\n\\n- <b>Flexibility:</b> Gain more control over the logic and triggers for real-time updates, allowing you to create event-driven workflows tailored to your dashboard\u2019s needs.\\n- <b>Scalability:</b> Utilize serverless architectures like AWS Lambda to handle increasing load and ensure application responsiveness during peak usage.\\n- <b>Reliability:</b> Improve fault tolerance by implementing redundancies and fallback mechanisms, reducing reliance on third-party services for real-time updates.\\n- <b>Reduced Latency:</b> Optimize data flow from the blockchain to your application, minimizing latency for a more responsive user experience.\\n\\n## 5.Updating the Dashboard UI\\n\\nCreate a function to update the dashboard UI with new transaction data:\\n\\n```js\\nfunction updateDashboard(transactions) {\\n  // Update the dashboard UI with new transaction data\\n  // This will depend on the frontend framework you\'re using\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## 6. Receiving Real-Time Transaction Updates\\n\\nFor clients to receive real-time transaction updates, set up a listener for the Push Protocol events:\\n\\n```js\\nconst transactionsChannel = pushSocketClient.channel(\'transactions\');\\n\\ntransactionsChannel.on(\'transactions\', (data) => {\\n  const transactions = data.transactions;\\n  updateDashboard(transactions);\\n});\\n```\\n\\nWith this setup, your application will listen to new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain using the Alchemy provider. When a new block is detected, it fetches the transaction data and updates the analytics dashboard. Additionally, it emits a real-time event through the Push Protocol REST API so that connected clients receive updates instantly. Clients listen for these events using the Push Protocol Socket client and update their dashboards accordingly.\\n\\nKeep in mind that this is a high-level example and is meant to serve as a sample. Depending on your specific requirements, you will need to customize and expand this code to fetch and display additional data or integrate with other services.\\n\\n## Tips to Remember When Building a Successful Real-Time Analytics Solution\\n\\nTo create a successful real-time analytics dashboard for blockchain transactions using Alchemy and Push Protocol, we suggest keeping these things in mind:\\n\\n- Focus on providing relevant, actionable insights that users can use to make informed decisions. To do this, harness Alchemy\u2019s robust infrastructure and enhanced APIs to fetch your blockchain data, as well as Push Protocol\u2019s real-time communication capabilities.\\n- Implement data caching and other performance optimization techniques to minimize latency, taking advantage of Alchemy\u2019s efficient APIs and Push Protocol\u2019s instantaneous updates.\\n- Regularly update and refine your dashboard based on user feedback and changing market trends, using the insights provided by Alchemy\u2019s monitoring tools and Push Protocol\u2019s user engagement features.\\n- Integrate your dashboard with other blockchain tools and platforms to provide additional value and context, leveraging the compatibility and versatility of both Alchemy and Push Protocol in the blockchain ecosystem.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBuilding a real-time analytics dashboard for blockchain transactions with Alchemy and Push Protocol can provide valuable insights and improve user experience.\\n\\nBy following the steps outlined in this blog post and leveraging the powerful features of these tools, you can create an engaging and informative dashboard that benefits both developers and users alike.\\n\\nWe encourage you to experiment with the technology and share your experiences with the community.

This enhancement to Graviton\u2019s user experience is enabling creators to communicate directly with their audience, share updates, and receive valuable feedback. In turn this is helping artists create and build their own communities. Additionally, Graviton is planning to expand capabilities with Push Chat and plans to introduce Group and Video Chat functionalities in the near future.\\n\\nIn this episode of \u201cFrens of Push,\u201d we are thrilled to have [Troy Murray](https://twitter.com/TroyMurs), CEO and co-founder at Graviton, join us for an insightful conversation about his journey in web3 and the groundbreaking solutions they are building for creators. We discuss decentralized communication, facilitated by Chat and Direct Messaging, and the doors it opens in the creator economy.\\n\\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\\n\\n## 1. Hi Troy, what\u2019s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space?\\n\\nI started working in Crypto around 2013 and became active in the Bitcoin community. From there I was interested in Smart Contracts around Ethereum and started to work closely with ConsenSys. I joined one of their spokes, SingularDTV and helped design a DAO for their software. I left that company and co-founded BarnBridge, a DeFi protocol, from there I went and co-founded Graviton a c-corp based in Puerto Rico that builds WEB3 tools, services, and platforms for the Metaverse.\\n\\n## 2. Tell us about Graviton \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem is Graviton solving?\\n\\nGraviton was founded out of what we felt was the need to create easy to use front ends for every day users to access the metaverse using polished web3 tools, services and platforms. We also wanted to prove our thesis that Protocols and the DAOs that control them are just a part of the tech stack and that you need a company to actually take multiple different protocols and wrap them up in a single platform. This is where Xeenon came from. We use Livepeer protocol for transcoding of videos, LENS protocol for social and PUSH protocol for direct messaging.\\n\\n## 3. How do developers use Xeenon?\\n\\nXenon is for creators and it is a streaming service that looks very much like what most people are used in a streaming service but under the hood the entire tech stack is built on decentralized technology from the transcoding all the way to the o-auth.\\n\\n## 4. What\u2019s the 2023 plan for Xeenon and its ecosystem?\\n\\nWe plan on growing the creator and fan experience on the platform and funding new ways for creators to monetize their work and also allow the fans to share in their economic flywheel.\\n\\n## 5. How is Graviton building with Push Chat?\\n\\nWe integrated Push Chat into our Xeenon platform for Direct Messaging and look forward to including Group and Video Chat soon.\\n\\n## 6. How have you seen Push Chat integration enhance your UX?\\n\\nThe ability of content creators to directly communicate with their fans on the platform is a huge win for us. We plan on adding more features to make the experience more intimate and with the coming updates to the protocol send tips and other things inside the platform through chat.\\n\\n## 7. What cool use cases do you see Push and Push Chat being used for in the future?\\n\\nI\u2019m really excited to get group and video chats going on the platform. Long term the way we can use this for community communication is gonna get really interesting.\\n\\nThank you :)\\n\\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center><br/>\\n\\n<i>\u201cFrens of Push\u201d is our weekly content series to spotlight outstanding projects that are building with Push.

Designing Smart Contracts\\n\\nSmart contracts are the backbone of your dApp, defining the rules and logic for your gaming collectibles. To learn more about smart contracts and blockchain development, check out <a href=\\"https://university.alchemy.com/\\"><b>Alchemy University</b></a>.\\n\\nYou\u2019ll need to create smart contracts for:\\n\\n- Creating and managing collectibles (e.g., ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens).\\n- Handling transactions, such as trading and transferring collectibles\\n- Implementing any game mechanics or rules associated with your collectibles.\\n- You can write your smart contracts using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), and thoroughly test them with tools like [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) and [Remix](https://remix-project.org/).\\n\\nHere\u2019s an example of a simple blockchain-based gaming collectibles system using a Solidity smart contract:\\n\\n```js\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\nimport \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol\\";\\nimport \\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\\";\\n\\ncontract GamingCollectibles is ERC721, Ownable {\\n   uint256 private _tokenIdCounter;\\n\\n   struct Collectible {\\n       uint256 tokenId;\\n       string name;\\n       uint256 power;\\n   }\\n\\n   mapping(uint256 => Collectible) public collectibles;\\n\\n   event NewCollectibleCreated(uint256 tokenId, string name, uint256 power);\\n\\n   constructor() ERC721(\\"GamingCollectibles\\", \\"GCOL\\") {}\\n\\n   function createCollectible(string memory _name, uint256 _power) public onlyOwner {\\n       uint256 newTokenId = _tokenIdCounter;\\n       _mint(msg.sender, newTokenId);\\n       _tokenIdCounter++;\\n\\n       Collectible memory newCollectible = Collectible({\\n           tokenId: newTokenId,\\n           name: _name,\\n           power: _power\\n       });\\n\\n       collectibles[newTokenId] = newCollectible;\\n       emit NewCollectibleCreated(newTokenId, _name, _power);\\n   }\\n\\n   function transferCollectible(address _to, uint256 _tokenId) public {\\n       require(ownerOf(_tokenId) == msg.sender, \\"Not the owner of the collectible\\");\\n       safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, _to, _tokenId);\\n   }\\n\\n   function getCollectibleDetails(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (Collectible memory) {\\n       return collectibles[_tokenId];\\n   }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis smart contract defines a simple gaming collectibles system with the following features:\\n\\n- ERC721 standard: The contract inherits from the OpenZeppelin\u2019s ERC721 and Ownable contracts, which provide a standard implementation for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ownership management.\\n- Creating collectibles: The contract owner can create new gaming collectibles by invoking the createCollectible function, providing a name and power for the new collectible. A unique token ID is assigned to each collectible, and a NewCollectibleCreated event is emitted.\\n- Transferring collectibles: Users can transfer their collectibles to other users by calling the transferCollectible function. The function checks if the sender is the owner of the collectible before transferring it.\\n- Querying collectible details: The getCollectibleDetails function allows users to query the details of a specific collectible using its token ID.\\n\\nThis is a basic example to demonstrate the concept. In a real-world implementation, you might want to consider adding more sophisticated features, such as a marketplace for trading collectibles, game mechanics that involve the collectibles, or integrating with other platforms for a richer gaming experience.\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f <b>Disclaimer:</b> This example smart contract is for educational purposes only and should not be used in production without a thorough audit and review by experienced developers.\\n\\n## 2. Building the User Interface\\n\\nCreate an engaging user interface that allows players to interact with your dApp. This includes:\\n\\n- Viewing their collectibles inventory\\n- Initiating trades and transfers\\n- Participating in any game mechanics or activities associated with your collectibles\\n\\nPopular frontend frameworks, such as [React](https://react.dev/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/), can be used to build your user interface. Integrate [Web3.js](https://web3js.org/#/) or [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) libraries to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nFor more advanced gaming experiences, consider using game engines like <a href=\\"https://unity.com/\\"><b>Unity 3D</b></a>, which supports WebGL export, or <a href=\\"https://www.unrealengine.com/\\"><b>Unreal Engine</b></a> for AAA-quality graphics. These engines provide more sophisticated tools for building immersive gaming environments and can be integrated with blockchain technologies for managing gaming collectibles.\\n\\nIf you\u2019d really like to test the limits, consider using WebAssembly-based (WASM) approach to build high-performance web3-based games.\\n\\n## 3.

It dictates how incentives are created, distributed, and managed within the network. Push Protocol is a decentralized communication layer for Web3 that uses a native token, $PUSH, to incentivize its network participants.\\n\\nIn this post, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Push token economics and explore how it differs from other token systems. We\u2019ll also examine the specific incentives driving the Push Protocol network and how they contribute to the network\u2019s overall success.\\n\\n## Push Token Economics: An Overview\\n\\nPush Protocol\u2019s token economics aim to create a circular economy run by the community, for the community. The goal is for every participant to be rewarded for their contributions while simultaneously discouraging behavior that would be detrimental to the network. The $PUSH token is at the center of the ecosystem, providing incentives for all network participants.\\n\\nThe $PUSH token is used in four primary ways within the Push Protocol ecosystem: securing the network, network utility, Push DAO and governance, and the reward pool fee. As Push Protocol expands to more chains and adds new forms of communication, more utility for $PUSH may emerge in addition to the four primary use cases.\\n\\n## 1. Securing the Network\\n\\nPush Nodes are an integral part of the Push Protocol network. These nodes allow Push Protocol to facilitate communication across multiple blockchains while retaining governance on the Ethereum mainnet. Push Nodes can be run by anyone and are incentivized to act in the network\u2019s best interest through the use of $PUSH tokens in Proof of Stake. Nodes that continue to reach consensus and operate in the network\u2019s best interest are rewarded in $PUSH tokens. Conversely, Push Nodes that do not remain synced with consensus or attempt to damage the network are penalized with the $PUSH tokens these bad actors staked.\\n\\n## 2. Network Utility\\n\\n$PUSH tokens are used as payment for message broadcasting on the Push Protocol network. When users broadcast a message, they must pay in $PUSH tokens to deliver that message to all interested parties. This payment incentivizes nodes on the network to relay the message to their peers, ensuring that the network remains fast and reliable.\\n\\n## 3. Push DAO and Governance\\n\\n53% of the supply of $PUSH has been allocated to the community to define the future of Push Protocol and its development. $PUSH also gives owners the right to vote on critical protocol decisions, including the staking structure, staking mechanisms, and reward distribution rates.\\n\\nGovernance votes can include:\\n\\n- The structure of the fees paid by services\\n- The DeFi mechanism for the staking pool\\n- Other protocol incentivization and financial elements\\n\\nPush Protocol adheres to Progressive Decentralized Governance. That is, a structure where power in decisions making is gradually distributed to the community. This approach allows token holders to have a say in the protocol\u2019s future direction, ensuring that the network remains aligned with the community\u2019s interests.\\n\\n## 4. Push Fee Pool\\n\\nThe Push Fee Pool is designed to reward various participants, fostering a circular economy within the Push Protocol ecosystem. As the community moves towards greater decentralization, the network will determine fees, such as those charged to \u201csuper users\u201d of chat and notifications (protocols sending large volumes of notifications) and fees related to the utility features of the protocol. It is essential to note that all fees are charged at the protocol level.\\n\\nThese fees are then distributed to $PUSH token holders and cryptocurrency wallets adopting the Push Protocol. The participants receiving rewards include token holders, wallet providers, and other stakeholders contributing to the ecosystem\u2019s growth and decentralization.\\n\\nThe $PUSH token incorporates a time-weighted feature, enabling the protocol to identify and reward token holders who have maintained their $PUSH holdings for extended periods. This mechanism ensures that long-term supporters of the project receive proportionally higher rewards.\\n\\nIn summary, the Push Fee Pool aims to clarify the following points:\\n\\n- Various participants, including token holders, wallet providers, and other stakeholders, are rewarded through the Push Fee Pool.\\n- Fees are charged at the protocol level and can include charges for \u201csuper users\u201d and utility features within the Push Protocol.-\\n- The fees collected are not from liquidity pools but rather from protocol-level activities.\\n- The $PUSH token\u2019s time-weighted feature ensures that long-term token holders receive proportionally higher rewards.\\n\\n## Key Features of Push Tokenomics:\\n\\nPush Protocol\u2019s token economics model is designed with several essential features to promote a robust and sustainable ecosystem:\\n\\n1. Circular Economy: The tokenomics aims to reward all network participants, encouraging them to hold onto tokens and contribute to the network\u2019s growth and development.\\n2. Hybrid Proof of Stake Mechanism: Push Protocol utilizes a hybrid Proof of Stake mechanism to secure the network. Rewards and penalties in $PUSH tokens incentivize good behavior and deter bad actors.\\n3. Community-driven Governance: The Push DAO and governance system empower the community to influence the network\u2019s future direction, ensuring alignment with the interests of its members.\\n\\nWhile some of these features may share similarities with other tokenomic models, the combination of these elements within Push Protocol\u2019s ecosystem helps create a unique and thriving environment for its users and stakeholders.\\n\\n## The Role of Incentive Schemes in Blockchain Networks\\n\\nIncentive schemes play a significant role in driving participation and fostering growth in blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. While they are not the sole determinant of success, well-designed incentives can encourage users to hold onto their tokens, actively engage with the network, and contribute to its growth and development. Common incentive schemes include proof of stake, proof of work, token burning, airdrops, staking, liquidity mining, and gamification. By striking a balance between incentivization and other factors such as technology, governance, and community engagement, a project can increase its chances of long-term success and sustainability.\\n\\nLet\u2019s break them all down:\\n\\nProof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism that uses token staking to incentivize network participants to act in the network\u2019s best interest. In PoS, validators stake tokens to verify transactions, and those who verify transactions correctly are rewarded with additional tokens. Those who act against the network\u2019s best interests may lose their staked tokens.\\n\\nProof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism that uses computational power to verify transactions. In PoW, miners solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the problem is rewarded with new tokens, and their block is added to the blockchain. PoW is resource-intensive and may lead to centralization.\\n\\nToken Burning removes tokens from circulation by sending them to an address that no one can access. Token burning can be used to increase the value of existing tokens by decreasing the overall supply.\\n\\nAirdrops are used by cryptocurrency projects to distribute free tokens to users. Airdrops can be used to increase network participation and attract new users. This is especially helpful for a project just starting out.\\n\\nStaking is a mechanism that allows users to hold tokens for a specific period to receive rewards in return. Staking incentivizes participants to hold onto their tokens and participate in the network; the longer they stake, the greater their rewards will be.\\n\\nLiquidity Mining incentivizes users to provide liquidity to a specific pool in exchange for tokens collected from trading fees. The more liquidity that is provided, the greater the rewards will be.\\n\\nGamification is a process of incentivizing users to complete specific actions. This can include completing transactions, referring friends, or engaging with the platform in other ways. By providing rewards for these actions, users are encouraged to continue using the platform and contributing to its growth and development.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nPush Protocol\u2019s token economics are designed to create a circular economy that incentivizes and rewards all network participants, while deterring behavior that would be detrimental to the network. Token economics and the resulting incentives play a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of a given cryptocurrency or project. Push Protocol achieves this through its use of a hybrid Proof of Stake mechanism and its Push DAO and governance system, which give the community a say in the network\u2019s future direction and foster a collaborative environment.\\n\\nAs the Push Protocol community continues to grow and evolve, the team is constantly looking to add more utility for the $PUSH token. This includes exploring new use cases for the token and incentivizing more participants to hold and use the token. The community plays a crucial role in fostering this innovation and contributing to the network\u2019s growth and development.\\n\\nIncentives and token economics are essential components of any successful blockchain or cryptocurrency project. Push Protocol\u2019s token economics exemplify a system that incentivizes participants to secure the network, pay for message broadcasting, and participate in network governance. As Push Protocol expands to more chains and adds new forms of communication, it will be exciting to see how its token economics evolve to create even more incentives for network participants. We invite you to join the Push Protocol community and discover the power of its token economics for yourself."},{"id":"let-s-embark-on-a-mission-w-push-protocol","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/let-s-embark-on-a-mission-w-push-protocol","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-08-push-missions/index.md","title":"Let\u2019s Embark on a Mission w.

It\u2019s a security program that enables users to communicate securely by decrypting and encrypting messages \u2014 but how does it work?\\n\\nIn this article we will explore how PGP encryption works and how it pertains to Push Protocol. Let\u2019s dive in.\\n\\n## The Fundamentals of PGP Encryption\\n\\nPGP encryption works by combining symmetric-key and public-key cryptography. The process involves the following steps:\\n\\n### Key Generation:\\n\\nEach user generates a public and private key pair. The public key is shared openly, while the private key remains confidential.\\n\\n### Encryption:\\n\\nWhen sending a message, the sender uses the recipient\u2019s public key to encrypt the message. This ensures that only the intended recipient with the corresponding private key can decrypt the message.\\n\\n### Signing:\\n\\nThe sender can digitally sign the message using their private key, creating a unique signature. This signature can be verified using the sender\u2019s public key, ensuring the message\u2019s authenticity and integrity.\\n\\n### Decryption:\\n\\nUpon receiving the message, the recipient uses their private key to decrypt it and, if applicable, verify the digital signature using the sender\u2019s public key.\\n\\n## An Example with Bundesbank\ud83c\udfe6\\n\\nAccording to their [official website](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/service/banks-and-companies/pki/pgp/pretty-good-privacy-pgp--621112), the Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, uses PGP encryption to secure confidential email communications. They employ a single PGP key for the entire organization (except for a few local installations). The key is 2048 bits long and valid until June 9, 2030. This key can be used to reach almost all Bundesbank email addresses securely.\\n\\nHere is an example of Bundesbank uses PGP encryption for emails:\\n\\n<b>Step 1: Obtain the Bundesbank\u2019s PGP Public Key</b> First, you need to obtain the Bundesbank\u2019s PGP public key. You can find it on their website or request it from the bank\u2019s contact. The fingerprint of their PGP public key is:\\n\\n7976 022F 5061 3189 F250 A187 3746 D004 4D8B 595E\\n\\n<b>Step 2: Import the Bundesbank\u2019s PGP Public Key</b> Import the Bundesbank\u2019s public key into your PGP software or email client (such as GnuPG, Thunderbird with Enigmail, or Outlook with Gpg4win).\\n\\n<b>Step 3: Compose Your Confidential Email</b> Write your confidential email to the Bundesbank using your preferred email client.\\n\\n<b>Step 4: Encrypt the Email</b> Before sending the email, use your email client\u2019s PGP functionality to encrypt the email with Bundesbank\u2019s public key. This ensures that only the Bundesbank, with the corresponding private key, can decrypt and read the email.\\n\\n<b>Step 5: Sign the Email (Optional)</b> You can also choose to sign the email using your own PGP private key digitally. This allows the Bundesbank to verify your identity and the integrity of your message using your public key.\\n\\n<b>Step 6: Send the Encrypted Email</b> Finally, send the encrypted email to the intended Bundesbank email address. The email will be securely transmitted and can only be decrypted and read by the Bundesbank.\\n\\nBy using PGP encryption, you can ensure that your confidential email communication with the Bundesbank remains secure and private, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access or tampering.\\n\\nThe example of Bundesbank using PGP encryption for secure email communication demonstrates the effectiveness of PGP encryption in protecting sensitive information in the traditional financial world. However, with the increasing connectivity and decentralization of communication systems, there is a need for secure messaging protocols that can ensure safe and confidential communication across a distributed network.\\n\\nThis is where the use of PGP in a decentralized communication protocol like Push Protocol comes in. Push Protocol provides high security and privacy for messaging systems by using PGP encryption in a distributed network of push delivery nodes. The push delivery nodes are responsible for delivering encrypted messages to their intended recipients in a secure and reliable manner.\\n\\nThe use of PGP encryption in the Push Protocol ensures that messages are encrypted end-to-end, meaning that only the sender and the recipient can decrypt and read the message. This provides a high level of security and privacy, even in a decentralized network.\\n\\n## PGP Encryption in Push Protocol: A Step-by-Step Process\\n\\nThe implementation of PGP encryption inPush Protocol involves several steps:\\n\\n### Key Storage:\\n\\nA PGP key pair is generated for their address when a user logs into Push Protocol for the first time. The private key is encrypted using the user\u2019s public key and sent to Push Nodes for storage, while the public key is stored locally on the user\u2019s device and used to encrypt outgoing messages.\\n\\n### Message Encryption:\\n\\nWhen a message is sent, the client-side application encrypts the message payload using the [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), which is a widely used and secure encryption algorithm. The AES algorithm is a complex encryption algorithm that uses a symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt data.\\n\\nA unique AES secret key is generated for each message, which is then encrypted using the PGP public keys of the sender and recipient. This ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the message, and that the message content remains secure and private during transit.\\n\\n### Message Transmission:\\n\\nThe encrypted message payload and AES secret key are sent to the Push Nodes, which then forward the message to the recipient.\\n\\n### Message Decryption:\\n\\nUpon receiving the message, the recipient decrypts the AES key using their PGP private key and then decrypts the message payload using the decrypted AES key.\\n\\n## Future-proofing PGP Encryption in Push Protocol\\n\\nThe flexibility and extensibility of PGP encryption in Push Protocol ensure that the system remains future-proof and adaptable. This means:\\n\\n### Multi-Chain Compatibility:\\n\\nAs blockchain networks adopt various encryption methods, Push Protocol can still facilitate secure communication by encrypting PGP keys using multiple methods.\\n\\n### Security Evolution:\\n\\nAs new security threats and vulnerabilities emerge, Push Protocol can upgrade its encryption methods easily, ensuring users\u2019 communications remain protected and private.\\n\\nIn conclusion, by integrating PGP encryption into Push Protocol, Push\u2019s messaging system provides a secure and private messaging solution for blockchain-based applications. The decentralized nature of Push Protocol, combined with the reliability and adaptability of PGP encryption, ensures users can communicate and transact with confidence. This is thanks to the fact messages and transactions are protected against interception and tampering. Additionally, Push Protocol\u2019s ability to easily upgrade its encryption methods in response to new security threats and vulnerabilities further enhances its ability to provide secure and private messaging services."},{"id":"april-monthly-recap","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/april-monthly-recap","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-03-april-montlhy-recap/index.md","title":"April Monthly Recap\u2728","description":"Cover image of April Monthly Recap\u2728","date":"2023-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 3, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"NewsLetter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/news-letter"},{"label":"Blockchain Development","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-development"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"}],"readingTime":3.2066666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"april-monthly-recap","title":"April Monthly Recap\u2728","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Welcome to another exciting month at Push Protocol!

ShapeShift is community-owned, open-source, and completely decentralized. With a user-friendly interface and secure transactions, ShapeShift has become a top choice among web3 traders and investors alike.\\n\\nAs a DAO seeking to communicate with users without compromising their personal information, privacy and security are particularly important for ShapeShift. ShapeShift leverages Push\u2019s secure notifications to keep users informed about governance, wallet and product updates. With a notification feed directly in the app, users can also easily access all Push notifications from their subscribed channels, enhancing their user experience.\\n\\nIn this episode of \u2018Frens of Push\u2019, we sat down with Willy from ShapeShift to talk about its partnership with Push and how ShapeShift is utilizing notifications to enhance the UX on its platform. Willy also shared his excitement about the future of this partnership, especially with the advent of Push Chat.\\n\\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\\n\\n## How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What\u2019s your story?\\n\\nShapeShift was started in 2014 in the wake of the devastating Mt. Gox hack from which millions of bitcoin were stolen. ShapeShift was created as the first way to trade crypto non-custodially from your own wallet rather than needing to deposit onto a centralized exchange.\\n\\nWilly started building in the blockchain space in 2017 when he co-founded Bitfract. Bitfract was built on top of ShapeShift\u2019s trading API and was the first tool to enable trading Bitcoin for multiple cryptocurrencies in a single transaction. In 2018, ShapeShift acquired Bitfract.\\n\\n## Tell us about ShapeShift \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem does ShapeShift solve?\\n\\nShapeShift is focused on building the ultimate interface to the decentralized universe. The early version is live now on app.shapeshift.com and also available in both the iOS and Android app stores.\\n\\nThe problem that ShapeShift solves is two-fold. On one hand, custodial crypto is centralized. This makes it risky, burdened by regulations, and fee-ridden.\\n\\nNon-custodial crypto isn\u2019t perfect either though. It comes with its own risks, is difficult, and often requires multiple wallets and tools.\\n\\nTo solve these problems, the ShapeShift community is focused on building an interface to the decentralized universe that follows each of the following principles:\\n\\n- Non-custodial/multi-wallet\\n- Multi-chain\\n- Open source\\n- Community-owned\\n- Decentralized\\n- Free\\n\\n## How\u2019s 2023 treating you so far? What\u2019s your Q2 plan \u2014 any new releases coming soon?\\n\\nBest year ever so far! Key metrics have been trending up and to the right since December, which is awesome to see in a bear market.\\n\\nWe have some really exciting updates planned for Q2, including FOX Rewards for users, cross-chain bridging, support for more chains, and displaying DeFi positions, which will make ShapeShift the most comprehensive interface for DeFi users who also hold non-EVM assets like bitcoin, doge, or cosmos assets.\\n\\nAlso very excited to create a growing list of useful automated wallet notifications with Push protocol and to work with Wherever to deliver native push notifications on smartphones.\\n\\n## How is ShapeShift using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\nCurrently ShapeShift uses Push to send governance, wallet, and product notifications to users that subscribe directly from the app. Thanks to the integration with Wherever, ShapeShift now has a notification feed directly in the app where users can not only see ShapeShift notifications, but notifications from all the Push channels they\u2019re subscribed to. Additionally, subscribers can opt in to receiving their Push notifications in email or Telegram. This is important because as a DAO, ShapeShift is seeking alternative ways to communicate with its users that don\u2019t rely on collecting and storing personal identifiable information.\\n\\n## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\nWe\u2019re very excited for p2p wallet chat. We also plan to add more automated notifications in the future, such as news and price notifications for assets you hold as well as notifications for wallet activity on more chains.\\n\\n## How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\nThe Push protocol has worked great at every step of the way, and the team has been incredibly helpful in supporting our integration and launch.\\n\\n## What haven\u2019t we asked you about that you wish we had?\\n\\nQ: Wow, how much does ShapeShift charge for all of this?\\n\\nA: Zero! ShapeShift is an open-source public good :)\\n\\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\\n\\n## About ShapeShift\\n\\nShapeShift is a non-custodial crypto exchange that offers a secure and simple way to trade crypto across multiple blockchains. Currently supporting 11 chains, the DeFi platform also offers various other ways to earn passive income on your crypto assets.

These devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers, receive messages from application servers and display them to the user.\\n\\n### Application Servers:\\n\\nApplication servers serve as intermediaries between a user device and the message source, ensuring that messages are delivered to the correct device and that the device can display the message. They perform additional functions such as message processing and storage, and may also provide features like message filtering or user authentication. Application servers are primarily responsible for delivering messages to the intended recipients.\\n\\n### Message Brokers:\\n\\nMessage brokers act as intermediaries between different applications and services, receiving messages from the source and forwarding them to the appropriate destination. They provide a middleware layer that facilitates efficient and reliable message delivery. Unlike application servers, message brokers do not process or store messages, but instead route messages between different applications or services based on their intended destination. They may also perform additional functions like message filtering or message transformation to ensure successful delivery.\\n\\n### Cloud Messaging Services:\\n\\nCloud messaging services are delivery nodes that send push notifications to user devices. These services act as intermediaries between the application server and the user device, processing and delivering messages from the application server to the user device through push notifications.\\n\\n## The Train Analogy\ud83d\ude82\\n\\nDelivery nodes in communication protocols can be compared to the different components of a train system.\\n\\n<b>Cloud messaging services</b> are like the train tracks that connect different destinations. They provide a reliable and efficient route for messages to travel between different devices and services.\\n\\n<br/><br/><b>Application servers</b> are like the trains that run on the tracks, carrying messages to their intended destinations. They ensure that messages are delivered to the correct device and can be displayed to the user. Application servers also perform additional functions like message processing and storage, as well as providing features like message filtering and user authentication.\\n\\n<br/><br/><b>Message brokers</b> are like the engines that propel the trains, ensuring they are running efficiently and reliably. The message brokers act as intermediaries between different applications and services, providing a middleware layer that facilitates efficient and reliable message delivery. Message brokers may also perform additional functions like message filtering or message transformation to ensure successful delivery.\\n\\n<br/><br/><b>User devices</b> are like train destinations, which receive the messages and display them to the users. They are the ultimate destination of the messages, and it is important that they receive the messages in a reliable and efficient manner.\\n\\nTogether, these delivery nodes work together to enable seamless and secure communication in a communication protocol. By understanding the different roles of each component and how they work together, businesses and organizations can implement effective messaging solutions that meet their specific communication needs.\\n\\n## Key Features of Push Notifications in Communication Protocols\\n\\nPush notifications are a crucial feature of modern communication protocols as they enable real-time updates to be delivered directly to a user\u2019s device even when the application is inactive. To enable push notifications, several key components must work together.\\n\\n### Cloud Messaging Services for Real-time Push Notifications\\n\\nDifferent cloud messaging services are available to enable real-time push notifications in applications. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Apple Push Notification Service (APNS), and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) are some of the popular options that provide similar functionality for sending real-time updates to user devices.\\n\\n### Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):\\n\\nOne popular cloud messaging service is Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), a cross-platform messaging service that supports real-time messaging for Android, iOS, and web applications. FCM is a reliable and efficient way to send push notifications to user devices, making it ideal for applications that require real-time updates.\\n\\nTo utilize FCM, an application must first integrate the FCM SDK, which provides the required functionality for sending and receiving messages. Once the SDK is integrated, the application can send messages to FCM using the FCM API.\\n\\nThe FCM API enables applications to send messages to individual devices, groups of devices, or topics. The \u2018topics\u2019 feature allows messages to be transmitted to multiple devices subscribed to a specific topic. This simplifies the process of messaging groups of users based on their interests or preferences.\\n\\nUpon receiving a message, FCM processes and delivers it as a push notification to the user device, which then displays the notification, providing real-time updates.\\n\\n### Alternative Cloud Messaging Services:\\n\\nApart from FCM, other cloud messaging services, such as Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), are available. These services offer similar functionality to FCM, allowing applications to send real-time push notifications to user devices.\\n\\n## The 5 Core Components of Push Chat\\n\\nThe Push Protocol is designed to allow developers to build messaging applications with a highly scalable, secure, and efficient messaging system. It relies on several services that make up the delivery nodes that handle the transmission of messages from sender to receiver.\\n\\n### 1. Push Tokens Service: Device Token Management\\n\\nThe first service in the Push Protocol is the Push Tokens Service. This crucial component is tasked with managing the registration of device tokens and their corresponding wallet addresses. When a user installs a messaging application, the Push Tokens Service generates a unique device token for their device and links it with their wallet address. This information is then stored in a database for future reference.\\n\\n### 2. Feed Processor Service: Message Payload Distribution\\n\\nThe next key service is the Feed Processor Service, which processes incoming feeds containing messages and data (also known as message payloads) along with recipient wallet addresses. This service retrieves the device tokens linked to the recipient wallet addresses from the Push Tokens Service and organizes them into batches based on the messaging platform\u2019s maximum size allowance. Each batch of device tokens and its corresponding message payload are then dispatched to the Push Message Service.\\n\\n### 3. Push Message Service: Message Transmission\\n\\nThe Push Message Service is at the heart of the message transmission process. Upon receiving batches of device tokens and message payloads from the Feed Processor Service, the Push Message Service stores this data in a database. The Push Message Service then processes the messages in batches, forwarding them to the appropriate devices via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).\\n\\n### 4. FCM Service: Delivering Messages to Devices\\n\\nThe FCM Service is responsible for ensuring that messages reach their intended devices. Utilizing the Firebase Cloud Messaging platform, it sends the message payload to the device tokens provided by the Push Message Service. The FCM Service subsequently receives a response from FCM, indicating whether each message was successfully delivered. In a failed delivery, the FCM Service forwards the device token to the Push Tokens Service for removal.\\n\\n### 5. Authentication Service: Securing Communication\\n\\nThe final puzzle piece of the process is the Authentication (Auth) Service. This service generates and administers server tokens to authenticate communication between the various services aforementioned.\\n\\nFor each wallet address that wants to receive messages, it must first request a token from the Auth Service. The Auth Service then generates a unique server token and associates it with a secret key for that wallet address. This information is stored in a database, and the server token is made available to the other services for authentication purposes when making requests.\\n\\nWith all these services working together, messages can be sent from one wallet to another through the messaging platform. The Feed Processor Service first processes the message, retrieves the recipient device tokens from the Push Tokens Service, and sends them to the Push Message Service. The Push Message Service then sends the messages to the devices using the FCM Service, which reports whether the message was delivered successfully or not. The Auth Service ensures that communication between the services is secure and authenticated.\\n\\n## Build With Push Delivery Nodes\\n\\nTo begin building with Push Delivery Nodes, read up on our documentation specifically for it here:\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/tutorials/integrate-notifications-via-delivery-node/"},{"id":"push-protocol-selected-as-communication-partner-for-d-app-store-kit","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-protocol-selected-as-communication-partner-for-d-app-store-kit","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-17-dapp-store-communication-partner/index.md","title":"Push Protocol Selected as Communication Partner for dApp Store Kit! \ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udc9c","description":"Cover image of Push Protocol Selected as Communication Partner for dApp Store Kit! \ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udc9c","date":"2023-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 17, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Polygon Network","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/polygon-network"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Partnerships","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/partnerships"},{"label":"Polygon","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/polygon"}],"readingTime":2.2266666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-protocol-selected-as-communication-partner-for-d-app-store-kit","title":"Push Protocol Selected as Communication Partner for dApp Store Kit! \ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udc9c","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Push Protocol is thrilled to announce that we have been selected as the communication solutions partner for dApp Store Kit!","tags":["Polygon Network","Web3","Partnerships","Polygon"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Understanding Delivery Nodes\ud83d\ude82","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/understanding-delivery-nodes"},"nextItem":{"title":"Push Protocol\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u3053\u3068\ud83d\udd14","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-protocol-1"}},"content":"![Cover image of Push Protocol Selected as Communication Partner for dApp Store Kit! \ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udc9c](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nPush Protocol is thrilled to announce that we have been selected as the communication solutions partner for dApp Store Kit!\\n\\nFor Push, this means integrations from hundreds of potential new dApp store fronts that are planning to build with the dApp Store Kit and exposure to the millions of Polygon users who will interact with these dApps.\\n\\nWe are extremely excited to be playing a critical role in dApp Store Kit stack and are looking forward to the integrations to come!\\n\\n## Breaking down: What is the dApp Store Kit?\\n\\ndApp Store Kit allows anyone to build a dApp store in web3.

Push Video is the first wallet-to-wallet video chat that allows web3 users to video chat with each other live. Get started at [app.push.org](https://app.push.org/chat)!\\n\\nPush Protocol began with push notifications to web3 in January 2022 on Ethereum. Since then, Push has expanded to Polygon and BNB Chain. In October 2022 at Devcon in Bogota, we announced the launch of Push Chat, our wallet-to-wallet messaging protocol. Since launch, Push Protocol has powered over 30M messages to 85,000+ users across 500+ integrations.\\n\\nBuilt on the success of Push Notifications and Push Chat, we\u2019re now excited to officially release Push Video!\\n\\nThe web3 social media and chat ecosystem is expanding rapidly today, but Push Video has always been our plan. Back in our [2020 whitepaper](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1590388512280711170?s=20), we referenced that decentralized video chat was on our timeline as a natural component to the web3 communication stack we built, starting with notifications. Also in Bogota, at Polygon Connect, we gave the community a [preview of Push Video](https://twitter.com/harshrajat/status/1579628569453813760?s=20), which was then under development. Between Bogota and today\u2019s announcement, we\u2019ve built off the success of Push Protocol notifications and Push Chat to expand the ecosystem of decentralized social networking.\\n\\n![Push Video 1](./image-1.png)\\n\\nWhat can you do with Push Video? Well, anything you do with video today. Social chats, business meetings, customer support, streaming, gaming, telehealth, education and coaching \u2014 the list goes on.\\n\\n### Launching at Pragma Tokyo, ETH Global\\n\\nBack in 2020, Push Protocol (then, EPNS) was born out of ETHGlobal 2020. Today, we are announcing Push Video during ETHGlobal in Tokyo, at the [Pragma](https://ethglobal.com/events/pragma-tokyo) event.\\n\\nAfter Push Chat, Push Video is the second major social networking product to be launched by Push Protocol. We will continue to develop these products, adding features like group and streaming. Soon in our roadmap we have web3 \u201cTwitter spaces like experience\u201d, allowing communities to come together on decentralized online forum. All of these products will be tied together by the fundamental notifications layer that we have built and scaled to date. Piece by piece, Push Protocol is building the decentralized social networking ecosystem for all users of the future internet.\\n\\n### The Push Developer Video SDK\\n\\nThe Push Developer Video SDK is launching soon! The SDK will give app developers an easy way to start integrating decentralized notifications, chat, and/or video directly into their applications. We\u2019ll be launching the SDK imminently, so join the #dev-chat channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) to learn more.\\n\\n### How to Get Started with Push Video?\\n\\nSending a video request and getting started with decentralized video chat is easy! Here\u2019s a step by step guide.\\n\\n<b>Step 1:</b> Head to <a href=\\"https://app.push.org/\\">app.push.org</a> and connect your MetaMask (or your preferred wallet).<br/><br/>\\n\\n<b>Step 2:</b> Click on \u201cPush Chat\u201d on the left navigation bar.

Now with Push notifications, Safe users can rest easy knowing they are in complete control and up to date on the status of their assets with real-time notifications to keep them informed.\\n\\nSafe is a collective asset management platform that provides a secure way for web3 organizations and users to manage their crypto funds. Unlike traditional wallets, Safe is a multi-signature smart contract wallet that allows users to define a list of owner/signer accounts and a threshold number of signers required to confirm a transaction. This feature makes Safe a popular choice for DAOs and other decentralized organizations that require the management of pooled funds.\\n\\nThe addition of notifications through Push Protocol will enhance the accessibility of transparent infomation tied to the Safe platform. By allowing users to gain real-time insights into the status of their transactions, notifications will enable users to take timely action whenever need be.\\n\\n## Push X Safe: Empowering Secure Asset Management\\n\\nAs a trusted decentralized custody protocol, easier transparent communication is now an additional feature Safe users can benefit from. Enhanced by Push, Safe users can feel confident about always being up to date on the state of their assets and transactions.\\n\\n<blockquote>It is great to see Push protocol integrating with Safe to offer our users another surface to have their pending transaction and signature notifications. We want to make smart account usability be akin to the simplicity of web2 and communication will play a part in that. \u2014 Lukas Schor, Co-founder of Safe</blockquote>\\n\\nBy opting in to Push notifications, Safe users can be notified of any pending signatures or executions of all the safes in a particular wallet address. Push is looking forward to exploring new ways to enhance the Safe UX with notifications and are excited for what\u2019s to come.\\n\\n<blockquote>\u201cWe\u2019re excited to see these pending transaction notifications take effect and similarly excited to explore additional opportunities for using web3 communication to enhance Safe\u2019s UX\u201d \u2014 Harsh Rajat, Push Protocol CEO & Co-founder</blockquote>\\n\\nIt\u2019s Push\u2019s goal that this collaboration with Safe will showcase a way in which web3 organizations and individuals can better monitor their crypto assets.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to be working alongside the Safe team and paving the way for a safer and more decentralized future.\\n\\n## About Safe\\n\\nSafe (previously Gnosis Safe) is a on-chain asset custody protocol, securing ~$40 Billion in assets today.

This infrastructure is often relied on for web3-based systems. Through our web3 tools, developers can now create innovative applications and governance structures that tackle the coordination problem in web3.\\n\\nWith its expansive array of possibilities, Push invites developers to bring the web3 vision to life through custom, creative solutions that deliver on the full potential of decentralized systems.\\n\\nLet\u2019s explore some examples.\\n\\n## Enabling Real-Time Communication Between DAOs\\n\\nPush Protocol revolutionizes communication within the web3 ecosystem, including between DAOs. With the innovative Push Chat and Protocol features, DAOs can incorporate Push to communicate and make decisions in real time, elevating their coordination and decision-making processes. This allows stakeholders in multiple projects and developers working in one or various ecosystems to collaborate and connect seamlessly and efficiently through their associated DAOs, truly scaling the development and building processes within the web3 space.\\n\\nAnd it\u2019s not just DAOs that benefit \u2014 other agents in the web3 ecosystem can participate in discussions directly from their wallets or dapps, bridging the gap and fostering seamless collaboration.\\n\\n## Breaking Down Barriers to New Solutions\\n\\nAs we\u2019ve outlined, the current web2 communication infrastructure is centralized and controlled by a few large corporations, resulting in censorship, data privacy breaches, and a lack of transparency. Push Protocol solves these issues by providing a decentralized communication layer controlled by the community. Its open-source codebase and IP program guarantee that the protocol evolves transparently and democratically, with the community having the final say on any changes or improvements.\\n\\nMoreover, Push Protocol provides a range of tools for developers to build and customize their solutions, including the Push Chat, which enables real-time communication, and the Push-SDK, which offers a range of functionality for building and integrating with the protocol. Additionally, Push Protocol provides seamless integration with other web3 technologies, such as Ethereum and Polygon, making it an invaluable addition to any web3 development stack.\\n\\nWith all this in mind, there are many ways that the governing of this model can be improved, which includes communication directly to interested users and notifications on important updates and changes, web3 style!\\n\\n## Unlocking Next-Generation Governance Structures\\n\\nIncorporating a decentralized communication layer like Push Protocol in web3 infrastructure is the key to unlocking next-generation governance structures. The ability for DAOs and other actors in the web3 ecosystem to communicate and coordinate seamlessly opens up new possibilities for improving and refining existing governance structures. From upgrading voting mechanisms to enhancing ownership and communication processes, the introduction of Push Protocol will allow web3 governance-based systems to scale and evolve in ways never before seen.\\n\\n## Pushing the Limits of Improvement Proposals\\n\\nPush Protocol\u2019s Improvement Proposal program, PIP or Push Improvement Proposals, provides a transparent and open forum for stakeholders to submit proposals for improvements and changes to the protocol. Like the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) program and other DAO-facilitated programs, such as the Polygon DAO and Uniswap DAO, the PIP program ensures that Push Protocol stays at the forefront of the web3 landscape, continuously evolving and improving to meet the community\u2019s needs.\\n\\nHowever, most improvement proposal programs rely on a subset of web2-based technology and communication channels. By providing a decentralized communication layer for DAOs, Push Protocol is taking the next step in scaling improvement proposals, enabling stakeholders, whether they are users, developers, investors, etc., to coordinate robustly across different improvement proposals."},{"id":"push-protocol-push-is-now-listed-on-crypto-com","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-protocol-push-is-now-listed-on-crypto-com","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-30-posh-on-crypto-com/index.md","title":"Push Protocol ($PUSH) is Now Listed On Crypto.com!","description":"Cover image of Push Protocol ($PUSH) is Now Listed On Crypto.com!","date":"2023-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"New Listings","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/new-listings"},{"label":"Cryptocom","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/cryptocom"}],"readingTime":0.52,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-protocol-push-is-now-listed-on-crypto-com","title":"Push Protocol ($PUSH) is Now Listed On Crypto.com!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.png","text":"We\u2019re glad to share that Push Protocol ($PUSH) is now listed in the Crypto.com App, one of the biggest exchanges in the US with over 80 million customers.","tags":["Web3","New Listings","Cryptocom"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Enhancing Governance Through Web3 Communication Tools \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/enhancing-governance-through-web3-communication-tools"},"nextItem":{"title":"Launch of The Push Ambassadors Program \ud83d\udc9c (English + Espa\xf1ol)","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/launch-of-the-push-ambassadors-program-english-espanol"}},"content":"![Cover image of Push Protocol ($PUSH) is Now Listed On Crypto.com!](./cover-image.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWe\u2019re glad to share that Push Protocol ($PUSH) is now listed in the Crypto.com App, one of the biggest exchanges in the US with over 80 million customers.\\n\\nCrypto.com App users can now purchase PUSH with USD, EUR, GBP, and 20+ fiat currencies, and spend it at over 80 million merchants globally using the Crypto.com Visa Card.\\n\\nTo users of Crypto.com, we are excited to be increasing accessibility to our native token and look forward to new holders joining our growing community!\\n\\n[Trade $PUSH now on Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/exchange/trade/PUSH_USD)\\n\\nYou can also read the official announcement from Crypto.com here: https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-app-lists-push-protocol-push\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n## About Crypto.com\\n\\nCrypto.com is one of the biggest exchanges in the world.

This is where communication channels come in. Serving as a bridge between dapps and users, enabling notifications, chat messages and other forms of communication across various blockchain networks.\\n\\nIn this article we will dive deeper into the concept of communication channels, their evolution in the current web, and how Push Protocol is being used to improve this communication process.\\n\\n## What Are Communication Channels?\\n\\nA communication channel is a virtual connection that enables the exchange of information between two or more entities. In the current web, communication channels are typically software-based programs or services that facilitate the exchange of messages, images, files, or other forms of data between users.\\n\\nCommunication channels have been a crucial part of the web since its inception. In the era of Web2, communication channels are ubiquitous and enable us to communicate with our friends, family, and colleagues in real-time. Examples of communication channels in the current web include messaging apps, social media platforms, email, and video conferencing tools like Telegram and Zoom.\\n\\nCommunication channels in Web2 can be divided into two categories: synchronous and asynchronous.\\n\\n<b>Synchronous</b> communication channels refer to real-time communication between two or more individuals. The most common examples of synchronous communication channels include phone calls, instant messaging, and video conferencing. These channels allow people to communicate with each other in real-time.\\n\\n<b>Asynchronous</b> communication channels on the other hand, refers to communication that doesn\u2019t require real-time interactions. The most common examples of asynchronous communication channels include email, social media, and forums. These channels allow people to communicate with each other at their own convenience.\\n\\nIn Web2, communication channels have been used by businesses to improve customer engagement and provide better customer service. For instance, businesses can use email or social media to inform customers about product updates, promotions, and special offers. They can also use messaging apps and chatbots to provide customer support and resolve issues in real-time.\\n\\nIn Web3, communication channels have a similar function but operate on different infrastructures. Instead of relying on centralized servers, Web3 communication channels are built on decentralized networks, such as the Ethereum blockchain. These channels allow dapps, wallets, and services to send notifications, chat messages, and other forms of communication to their users on various blockchain networks.\\n\\nAt a technical level, a communication channel in Web3 typically involves the creation of a smart contract on the blockchain. The smart contract acts as an intermediary between the dapp, wallet, or service and its users, enabling messages to be sent back and forth. These messages can be encrypted to provide an additional layer of security and privacy.\\n\\n## Push Protocol and Communication Channels\\n\\nWithin Push Protocol, a communication channel is a service via smart contracts that facilitates messaging and notifications for Web3 users. These communication channels enable dApps, protocols, or even Web2 services to send messages to subscribers directly linked to their wallet addresses. Communication channels are designed to be chain-agnostic, meaning that they can deliver messages on any network of choice.\\n\\nPush Protocol allows for both general chat and notifications. Users can restrict receiving notifications only from specific channels to ensure they only receive messages from approved senders. Users can opt in or out of the channels they are interested in without incurring transaction fees. The communication channels are also spam resistant and ensure that subscribers only receive messages relevant to them. This is accomplished through smart message filtering, ensuring that users only receive notifications that are relevant to their interests.\\n\\n## Creating a Communication Channel\\n\\nCreating a communication channel on Push Protocol is a simple process that can be done using the Push dapp or smart contracts. To set up a channel, you will need the following:\\n\\n- A channel name\\n- A channel logo (an image of size 128px \\\\* 128px)\\n- An amount of 50 $PUSH tokens in your wallet (and some ETH)\\n- A brief channel description (250 characters)\\n- Channel CTA (call-to-action link)\\n- Network & Alias address\\n\\nOnce you have created a channel on the compatible blockchain, you can enable it on other blockchain networks, such as Binance Chain (BNB).\\n\\n## BNB Chain (Binance Channel Setup)\\n\\nWith the recent Binance Chain (BNB) deployment, let\u2019s look at how you can create a communication channel that seamlessly communicates with users on the BNB network.\\n\\nYou must complete two straightforward steps to set up a channel alias address for the Binance Chain. First, select the Binance Chain and provide the correct alias address for the channel during its creation. Second, you need to verify the alias address on the Binance Chain.\\n\\nIt\u2019s essential to note that the alias verification procedure is part of the channel creation process, and verification must occur on the selected chain. This procedure ensures that the alias address provided during channel creation actually belongs to the channel owner. Once the verification is complete, the channel owner can use their alias address to communicate with subscribers on the Binance Chain.\\n\\nIn practice, the verification process involves\\n\\n- Logging into the dApp with the same address provided as the Alias Address during channel creation\\n- Navigating to the Create Channel menu\\n- Clicking the <b>Verify Alias Address</b> button\\n\\nOnce the verification transaction is approved on the Binance Chain, the alias address is successfully verified on the Binance Chain and linked with the Ethereum network channel. The channel owner can access their channel profile page and send notifications from the Binance Chain using their alias address.\\n\\nIt\u2019s worth noting that delegate addresses are also useful for ensuring notifications can be sent out from wallets other than the one that created the channel. The channel creator is the only person able to add or remove delegates at any time. The communication channels\u2019 chat feature also allows users to whitelist addresses, block addresses, and prevent spam messages. These features help ensure that communication channels remain secure and relevant to their subscribers.\\n\\nTo learn more about Channel Aliases and Delegates, you can refer to [Push documentation here](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/concepts/push-notifications-for-web3/#what-is-a-channel-alias).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nCommunication channels play a crucial role in enabling decentralized applications and services to communicate with their users. Push Protocol offers a chain-agnostic solution that enables communication across ecosystems and networks.

These protocols define how information is transmitted across the network, including how data is encoded, transmitted, and received.\\n\\nThese devices are connected together through a variety of wired and wireless connections, including fiber optic cables, copper wires, and radio waves.\\n\\nThe internet is based on a set of standard protocols, including TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which define how data is transmitted across the network. This creates a foundation for how data is broken down into packets, how those packets are addressed and routed across the network, and how they are reassembled into a complete message at the destination.\\n\\nThese protocols allow computers and devices to communicate with each other regardless of their location or type. They also provide a foundation for a wide range of applications and services, including email, web browsing, social networking, and online commerce.\\n\\n## How the Internet got Centralized.\\n\\nThe internet started out as a decentralized network, with no central authority in control. However, over time, the internet has become increasingly centralized as companies and organizations have gained more power and control over critical aspects of the network.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons for this centralization is the growth of large internet service providers (ISPs) and content providers. These companies have become dominant players in the online ecosystem, controlling vast amounts of data and traffic, and using their power to influence how the internet is used and accessed.\\n\\nAnother factor contributing to centralization is the development of proprietary technologies and platforms that are controlled by a few large companies. For example, many people use Google\u2019s search engine, Facebook\u2019s social media platform, and Amazon\u2019s Web Service, which all operate on proprietary technology that is controlled by those companies.\\n\\nIn addition, there are certain technical limitations of the internet itself that can contribute to centralization. For example, the Domain Name System (DNS), which is used to translate domain names into IP addresses, is controlled by a small number of organizations, making it a point of centralization.\\n\\n## The Blockchain.\\n\\nA blockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger that is used to record transactions or information in a secure and transparent manner.\\n\\nAt its core, a blockchain consists of a network of computers that work together to validate and record each transaction. Each transaction is added to a basic containers of information in a blockchain which are known as block, which is then added to the existing chain of blocks, creating an immutable and transparent ledger that is visible to all participants in the network.\\n\\nThe security of a blockchain is achieved through the use of cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms. Each transaction is encrypted and validated by multiple participants in the network, using a consensus mechanism such as proof of work or proof of stake. Once validated, the transaction is added to the blockchain and cannot be altered or deleted.\\n\\n## The Need for Decentralized Communication Protocols\\n\\n![Need for decentralized](./image-2.png)\\n\\nDecentralized communication protocols on the blockchain offer several benefits that traditional centralized communication systems cannot provide. Here are some of the reasons why a decentralized communication protocol on the blockchain is needed:\\n\\n- <b>Security:</b> Decentralized communication protocols on the blockchain are more secure as they use cryptography and peer-to-peer networking to ensure that messages are transmitted securely and cannot be intercepted or tampered with by third parties. In contrast, centralized communication systems are vulnerable to hacking, data breaches, and other security threats.\\n- <b>Privacy:</b> Decentralized communication protocols on blockchain offer greater privacy as they do not require users to provide personal information to a centralized authority. This helps to protect users\u2019 privacy.\\n- <b>Censorship resistance:</b> Decentralized communication protocols on blockchain are resistant to censorship as there is no centralized authority that can control or censor the flow of information. This helps to ensure that people can communicate freely without fear of censorship or repression.\\n- <b>Ownership and control:</b> Decentralized communication protocols on blockchain give users ownership and control over their data and communications. In contrast, centralized communication systems often collect and use user data for commercial or other purposes without their consent.\\n\\nOverall, a decentralized communication protocol on blockchain is needed to provide greater security, privacy, censorship resistance, ownership, control, and transparency than traditional centralized communication systems. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, decentralized communication protocols can help to create a more open, secure, and democratic internet for everyone.\\n\\n## The Push Protocol\\n\\nPush protocol is a decentralized communication protocol. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services through an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic mechanism.\\n\\nThis means that different applications and services can communicate with each other in a secure and open way, regardless of the blockchain platform they are built on.\\n\\nThe Push protocol provides an open communication layer that allows any crypto wallet/frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across. This can help to improve the interoperability and usability of decentralized applications and services in the blockchain ecosystem.\\n\\nPush has empowered the web3 space by delivering 25 million+ notifications, 70k+ subscribers, and over 150 integrations so far.\\n\\n![Ecosystem](./image-3.png)\\n\\n<center>The Push Ecosystem</center>"},{"id":"halo-fi-teams-up-with-push-to-enable-effortless-savings-with-real-time-notifications","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/halo-fi-teams-up-with-push-to-enable-effortless-savings-with-real-time-notifications","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-21-halofi-push/index.md","title":"HaloFi Teams Up with Push to Enable Effortless Savings with Real-Time Notifications\ud83d\ude07","description":"Cover image of HaloFi Teams Up with Push to Enable Effortless Savings with Real-Time Notifications\ud83d\ude07","date":"2023-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 21, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Frensofpush","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/frensofpush"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"},{"label":"Defi","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/defi"}],"readingTime":3.5233333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"halo-fi-teams-up-with-push-to-enable-effortless-savings-with-real-time-notifications","title":"HaloFi Teams Up with Push to Enable Effortless Savings with Real-Time Notifications\ud83d\ude07","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"This week, we\u2019re delighted to showcase foremost DeFi savings platform and the newest addition to our \u2018Frens of Push\u2019, HaloFi","tags":["Frensofpush","Web3","Blockchain Technology","Defi"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Web3 & Push Protocol through the Lens of First Principle Thinking\ud83d\udd0d","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/web3-and-push-protocol-through-the-lens-of-first-principle-thinking"},"nextItem":{"title":"Bankless Nation and Push Partner to Enable News Notifications \ud83d\udd14","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/bankless-nation-and-push-partner-to-enable-news-notifications"}},"content":"![Cover image of HaloFi Teams Up with Push to Enable Effortless Savings with Real-Time Notifications\ud83d\ude07](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis week, we\u2019re delighted to showcase foremost DeFi savings platform and the newest addition to our \u2018Frens of Push\u2019, [HaloFi](https://halofi.me/)\ud83d\ude07\\n\\nHaloFi (previously and popularly known as GoodGhosting) is a DeFi savings platform encouraging people to save in a fun, gamified manner. You can enter a challenge to increase your savings, and earn NFTs, badges, and a spot on the leaderboard. But that\u2019s not all. You can create and vote on challenges of your choice as you watch your savings grow.\\n\\nSay goodbye to dull financial management and hello to HaloFi.\\n\\nFor a DeFi platform like HaloFi, it\u2019s critical to keep users informed so they don\u2019t miss out on new challenges or lose track of their savings journey. This is where Push comes in. With Push, HaloFi can easily notify users when a new challenge is launched, ensuring they never miss out on any exciting opportunities to save and earn rewards.\\n\\nIn this episode of \u201cFrens of Push\u201d, we are in conversation with [Rachel](https://twitter.com/RachBLondon) from HaloFi to talk about how HaloFi is progressing on its mission to enable easy personal financial management and how Push protocol is helping.\\n\\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\\n\\n## Hi Rachel, how did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What\u2019s your story?\\n\\nI became involved in building in the blockchain space back in 2017 when I was working as a developer. At first, I didn\u2019t really understand blockchain, but that all changed after I spoke to someone at a hackathon who told me \u201cbitcoin has never been hacked.\u201d That statement sent me down the rabbit hole, and I started to learn some Solidity and explore the technology more. This newfound interest ultimately led me to change jobs and start working in developer relations for a protocol. That all happened in 2017/8 and since then I have been working full-time in the industry. That\u2019s the short version of my story!\\n\\n## Tell us about HaloFi \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem does HaloFi solve?\\n\\nHaloFi is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that was first conceptualized in early 2020. While there are many DeFi protocols in the market, HaloFi addresses the issue of accessibility by making it easy for everyday people to save and build their personal wealth. Originally called GoodGhosting, the name was coined during an ETH London Hackathon at 4am, we recently rebranded to HaloFi. But our mission of helping people become their best financial selves, stays.\\n\\n![Dashboard](./image-1.jpg)\\n\\nWithin our app, users can join \u201cSaving\u201d or \u201cHold\u201d challenges, which require them to make regular deposits or hold their tokens for the long term. If users meet these goals, they are rewarded with additional returns from DeFi protocols, badges, and other incentives. Overall, HaloFi aims to make saving and building wealth accessible and fun for everyone. We are bringing gamification to DeFi personal finance.\\n\\n## What\u2019s your 2023 plan for you and your team?\\n\\nWe recently rebranded, and alongside this launched a suite of new features; badges, leaderboards, shareable profile pages, fiat on and off ramps, and bridging solutions. We will be building on these to make HaloFi even more accessible, fun, and engaging. Ultimately we want to be the place where people start their DeFi journey. I can\u2019t mention specifics, but there will be a lot in the pipeline.\\n\\n## How is HaloFi using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\nWe are currently using Push to notify users when a new challenge launches, this means anyone using Push can be one of the first to be notified. Meaning you won\u2019t miss a tasty challenge or end up FOMOing.\\n\\nLet us know if you are using Push and HaloFi, as we have a number of additional integrations that are possible, but we want to make it work with how users are using both our product and Push. The possibilities of a crypto-native messaging layer are huge!\\n\\n## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\nThere are many! Aside from additional information about transactions, i.e. Venmoing crypto, Push could be one of the main social messaging platform, since we all now have wallet\u2019s it makes very good sense to build more social applications on top of these. For DAOs, this also has the benefit of more identity security. We\u2019ve seen time and time again how dangerous malicious impersonations can be. It think it\u2019s important we build secure and web3 native infra structure to solve this.\\n\\n## How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\nPush is a great tool for updating our community of new challenges, updates to our product and other news. It feels great to not have to rely on third party email or text solution, which sometimes can cut you out without notice. Ultimately Push is a great community building tool.\\n\\n## What do you do if you\u2019re not working?\\n\\nRollerskating! This has been my latest hobby and it\u2019s a great way to switch off, whilst being tons of fun. Aside from that travel, but I have to be honest, web3 and crypto takes up a lot of my time!\\n\\n## What haven\u2019t we asked you about that you wish we had?\\n\\nSomething that is important to me is how can we make web3 tech more accessible. We think about this alot at HaloFi, and I\u2019m sure you also do at Push. Personally I\u2019m very excited to see the developments in account abstraction, as wallet UX has always been a pain. However I also think it\u2019s important to build apps that people want to use, and can understand. We saw in 2021 how explosive the growth of NFTs was. In DeFi there is a need for easy to understand, accessible applications. We are working on this daily at HaloFi.\\n\\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center><br/>\\n\\nFor HaloFi users, the Push channel is LIVE.

Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms with unique features, capabilities, and ecosystems.\\n\\nWith that, the need for interoperability between these different platforms has been a major challenge for blockchain technology\u2019s growth and mass adoption. As such, cross-chain solutions have become essential to enable seamless interaction between different blockchain platforms though they still lack a critical component \u2014 communication.\\n\\nThis is where the Push Protocol comes into play.\\n\\n## What is Cross-Chain?\\n\\nCross-chain refers to the ability of different blockchain platforms to communicate and interact. In other words, cross-chain technology enables the transfer of assets, data, and additional information between different blockchain platforms.\\n\\nThis opens up a world of possibilities for blockchain technology, as it allows for the creation of dApps that can operate across multiple blockchain platforms without being limited by the constraints of a single platform.\\n\\n## What\u2019s the difference between Cross-Chain and Multichain?\\n\\nMultichain technology refers to creating an internet of blockchains, where blockchains can communicate freely while remaining secure. This is achieved through a shared underlying security layer that connects the different blockchain platforms.\\n\\nOn the other hand, cross-chain technology uses smart contracts to create synthetic versions of coins that can interact with other blockchains directly. In other words, multichain is about connecting blockchains, while cross-chain is about connecting assets and data across blockchains.\\n\\n## Recap on Interoperability\\n\\nInteroperability is the ability of different systems to work together seamlessly. In the context of blockchain technology, interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain platforms to communicate and interact with each other. This is critical for the growth and mass adoption of blockchain technology, as it enables the creation of dApps that can operate across multiple blockchain platforms, providing users with more options and greater flexibility.\\n\\n## Push Protocol: Communication for Cross-Chain\\n\\nPush Protocol is the missing piece of Web3, filling the gap in critical infrastructure that has been holding back the growth and mass adoption of blockchain technology.\\n\\nUntil now, there was no solution to enable native communication between wallets in response to on and off-chain data. This has created a fractured dApp ecosystem held together by antiquated and centralized communication platforms. Push Protocol is building the communication network for Web3, addressing this gap and improving the everyday experience for blockchain users.\\n\\nPush Protocol adds the necessary middleware to achieve interoperability by providing a communication layer for cross-chain interoperability. This is especially important now, as the infrastructure layer is still being built and designed, not necessarily for the \u201cideal end product.\u201d\\n\\n## The Solution to the Problems of Cross-Chain Solutions\\n\\nImagine a future where cross-chain solutions can communicate with each other seamlessly, either autonomously or manually, sending out necessary notifications to indicate specific events. This opens up a world of possibilities and creates a more secure environment for users.\\n\\nWith the use of Push Protocol, cross-chain solutions can effectively communicate with each other, allowing for the implementation of fallbacks and fail-safes. This means that in the event of a security breach or other blockchain-related incident, these systems can automatically take effect, protecting users and their assets.\\n\\nBy having a native communication layer in the form of Push Protocol, cross-chain solutions can be made more resilient and safe, preventing terrible incidents such as hacking and the loss of funds without the ability to act.\\n\\n## The Need for Cross-Chain UX in Web3\\n\\nThere is often talk about the idea of the \u201csuper dApp\u201d or the \u201cuniversal dApp\u201d in the blockchain and Web3 space. But, real-time communication, which is a fundamental aspect of the internet as we know it, is often not a part of this equation. This can lead to a fragmented user experience for blockchain users who constantly shift between dApps and blockchain networks.\\n\\nPush Protocol addresses this issue by revolutionizing the user experience in Web3.

Why? Because traditional centralized messaging systems have their drawbacks, including vulnerabilities to hacks, censorship and the risk of downtime.\\n\\nThat\u2019s where decentralized messaging protocols come in. Decentralized protocols use blockchain technology and decentralized networks to create a more secure and resilient messaging infrastructure.\\n\\nWhile we\u2019ve already looked deeper into how [Push Chat](https://medium.com/push-protocol/were-still-pushing-a-deeper-look-into-push-chat-90fdea8d9e8e) works, we now want to see where it fits in the grand scheme of things. To start with, let\u2019s take a step back and examine how traditional chat applications work.\\n\\n## An Overview of Traditional Chat Applications\\n\\nMost traditional chat applications use a client-server model, where the client (e.g., a mobile app or desktop software) communicates with a central server to send and receive messages. The server acts as a mediator, routing messages between clients and storing them in a database.\\n\\nThis model has some advantages, such as the ability to support many users and the convenience of storing messages in a centralized location. However, it also has its drawbacks. The server is a single point of failure, meaning that if it goes down, the entire chat system becomes unavailable. Additionally, the server has complete control over the messages, which means it can censor or alter them if it chooses to. Not to mention, the ethos of web3 has shown us that distributing and decentralizing methods of communication is a logical next step to drive humanity forward.\\n\\n## An Example with Discord\\n\\nIn the traditional client-server model of chat applications, such as Discord, messages are typically stored on the central server in a database. When a user sends a message on a Discord channel, it is sent from the user\u2019s client to the Discord server over a network connection using a transport protocol, such as HTTP or WebSocket. The server then routes the message to the intended recipient and stores it in the database.\\n\\nIn the case of Discord, if the recipient has enabled push notifications, the server will send a push notification to the recipient\u2019s device when a new message is received (we explained this scenario in the <a href=\\"https://medium.com/push-protocol/my-app-would-like-to-send-you-push-notifications-4b591a68f803\\"><b>\u2019My App\u2019 Would Like to Send You Push Notifications blog post.)</b></a> The message is delivered directly from the server to the recipient\u2019s account when the recipient is online and has the Discord application open on their device. If the recipient is not online or has the application closed, the message is stored on the server until the recipient becomes available.\\n\\nThis process allows for real-time communication between users and the ability to receive notifications even when the app is not open. However, it also relies on a central server to route messages and sends notifications, which can be vulnerable to outages and censorship. It is worth noting that the specifics of how messages are stored and transmitted may vary depending on the particular chat application and implementation.\\n\\n## Our Answer to These Problems? Push Chat.\\n\\nPUSHing the standards of communication started with EPNS, which transformed in Push Protocol. But Push Protocol on it\u2019s own doesn\u2019t add value to the user nor the dApp, hence, we created a host of communication solutions to be used for real-life applications.\\n\\nWith an endless number of use cases, some of which high impact areas right now that Push can revolutionize are:\\n\\n- Wallet &lt; &gt; dApp communication\\n- Wallet &lt; &gt; Wallet communication\\n- Off-chain or private marketplace communication\\n- META communication in the metaverse\\n- Off-chain games and gamified events communication\\n\\nPush Chat\u2019s potential doesn\u2019t end there. It also has the potential to encourage the development of new communication primitives in the web3 space. Providing a secure and reliable messaging infrastructure opens the door for developers to create innovative solutions for messaging and communication that were not previously possible.\\n\\nCome explore Push Chat and see for yourself!\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 https://app.push.org/#/chat\\n\\n## An example of Governance: Disconnected Autonomous Organizations\\n\\nAs the decentralized ecosystem grows, so does the need for effective communication between decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and their users. Unfortunately, the current communication state in the space leaves much to be desired.\\n\\nCentralized tools dominate the space, requiring users to give up some level of their privacy and personal identity to participate. This can be a significant barrier for many, especially in cryptocurrency and blockchain, where anonymity is highly valued.\\n\\nPush Chat offers a solution to this problem, providing a decentralized communication layer for web3. With Push Chat, DAOs and their users can communicate with each other in a secure, anonymous, and censorship-resistant manner.\\n\\nUsing the power of peer-to-peer networks, Push Chat allows users to send messages directly to each other without the need for a central server. This enhances privacy and security and makes the system more resistant to censorship. But Push Chat isn\u2019t just a messaging platform \u2014 it also enables censorship-resistant, decentralized polling and voting on proposals submitted on the blockchain. [With our generalized SDK (docs)](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/concepts/push-chat-architecture/), you can use Push Chat for decentralization, security, and significantly lower costs in gas for you and your users.\\n\\nWhether voting on proposals, collaborating on projects, or just keeping in touch with fellow community members, Push Chat provides a powerful and easy-to-use solution for decentralized communication.\\n\\nPush Chat can even broadcast user transactions to a network of sequencers, where sequencers compete to include transactions, further decentralizing cryptocurrency infrastructure.\\n\\nWhether you\u2019re building a social network, a platform for collaborating on the artwork, open-source software, or any other type of dApp, Push Chat can provide a decentralized, private, censorship-resistant, and user-friendly experience for communication and collaboration. And with its ability to save gas fees through transaction aggregation, Push Chat can enhance the decentralization and ease of running your dApp or protocol, allowing users to submit their own transactions or creating a decentralized architecture that handles this for them."},{"id":"going-bananas-push-protocol-partners-with-ape-swap-for-seamless-web3-communication","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/going-bananas-push-protocol-partners-with-ape-swap-for-seamless-web3-communication","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-08-apeswap-push/index.md","title":"Going Bananas: Push Protocol Partners with ApeSwap for Seamless web3 Communication!\ud83d\udc35","description":"Cover image of Going Bananas: Push Protocol Partners with ApeSwap for Seamless web3 Communication!\ud83d\udc35","date":"2023-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"},{"label":"Announcements","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/announcements"},{"label":"Crypto","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/crypto"},{"label":"BNB","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/bnb"}],"readingTime":1.8066666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"going-bananas-push-protocol-partners-with-ape-swap-for-seamless-web3-communication","title":"Going Bananas: Push Protocol Partners with ApeSwap for Seamless web3 Communication!\ud83d\udc35","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Are you ready to take your DeFi experience to the next level?

Push has revamped it\'s socket API into stream API which is more versatile and developer friendly, click on the link below to learn more \ud83d\udc47.\\n:::\\n\\n<ABlock href=\\"https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/stream-chat\\" title=\\"Link to learn more about Push Stream API\\">Learn about Push Stream API</ABlock>\\n\\n## Note on Addresses\\n\\nIn any of the specified methods (unless explicitly stated otherwise), you can use either CAIP format (specifically CAIP-10) or the ETH address format.\\n\\nRecall that CAIP, or Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal, is a way to describe standards for blockchain projects that are not specific to a single chain. It was developed by the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process and is used to identify and encode information about Ethereum addresses, contract addresses, and other crypto-assets. For example, an ETH mainnet address would be in the form:\\n\\n<b>eip155:1:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb</b><br/><br/>\\n\\n<blockquote>The sockets API uses CAIP-10 (but defaults to the Ethereum address format), which is a specific proposal within the CAIP specification that focuses on the identification of blockchain addresses. It defines a format for representing addresses in a way that is both chain-agnostic and human-readable.</blockquote>\\n\\nThe ETH address format is supported for backwards compatibility. For example, an ETH mainnet address would be in the form <b>0xab16a96d359ec26a11e</b>\\n\\n## Creating a Socket Connection\\n\\nTo create a socket connection, you\u2019ll need to create a socket connection object.\\n\\n```js\\ncreateSocketConnection(options: SocketConnectionOptions): SocketConnection\\n```\\n\\nYou can use the <b>createSocketConnection</b> method to create a socket connection object. This method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\\n\\n- <b>user</b> (<b>string</b>, required): The user account address, in <a href=\\"https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md#test-cases\\">CAIP</a> format.\\n- <b>env</b> (<b>string</b>, optional, default: <b>\'prod\'</b>): The API environment to connect to. Can be <b>\'prod\'</b>, <b>\'staging\'</b>, or <b>\'dev\'</b>.\\n- <b>socketOptions</b> (<b>object</b>, optional): Options to pass to <a href=\\"https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-options/\\">SocketIO</a>.\\n\\nThis method returns a <b>SocketConnection</b> object that you can use to connect, disconnect, and subscribe to events.\\n\\n## For Notifications\\n\\nTo create a socket connection for notifications, you\u2019ll need to create a socket connection object.\\n\\n```js\\nconst pushSDKSocket = createSocketConnection({\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb\', // CAIP-10 format\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n  socketOptions: { autoConnect: false },\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## For Push Chat\\n\\nTo create a socket connection for chat, you should define the socket type as \u201cchat\u201d when instantiating the socket client. The user address can be in any format, including non-CAIP-10 formats.\\n\\n```js\\nconst pushSDKSocket = createSocketConnection({\\n  user: \'0xFd6C2fE69bE13d8bE379CCB6c9306e74193EC1A9\',\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n  apiKey:\\n    \'jVPMCRom1B.iDRMswdehJG7NpHDiECIHwYMMv6k2KzkPJscFIDyW8TtSnk4blYnGa8DIkfuacU0\',\\n  socketType: \'chat\',\\n  socketOptions: { autoConnect: true, reconnectionAttempts: 3 },\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThis method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\\n\\n- <b>user</b> (<b>string</b>, required): The user account address.\\n- <b>env</b> (<b>string</b>, optional, default: <b>\'prod\'</b>): The API environment to connect to. Can be <b>\'prod\'</b>, <b>\'staging\'</b>, or <b>\'dev\'</b>.\\n- <b>apiKey</b> (<b>string</b>, optional): The API key to use for authentication.\\n- <b>socketType</b> (<b>string</b>, optional, default: <b>\'notification\'</b>): The type of socket connection to create. Can be <b>\'notification\'</b> or <b>\'chat\'</b>.\\n- <b>socketOptions</b> (<b>object</b>, optional): Options to pass to <a href=\\"https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-options/\\">SocketIO</a>.\\n\\nThis method returns a <b>SocketConnection</b> object that you can use to connect, disconnect, and subscribe to events.\\n\\n## Connecting and Disconnecting\\n\\nOnce you have a <b>SocketConnection</b> object, you can use the <b>connect</b> and <b>disconnect</b> methods to establish or close the connection:\\n\\n```js\\nSocketConnection.connect(): void\\n```\\n\\nUse the <b>connect</b> method to establish a connection to the backend.\\n\\n```js\\nSocketConnection.disconnect(): void\\n```\\n\\nUse the <b>disconnect</b> method to close the connection to the backend.\\n\\n## Subscribing to Events\\n\\nOnce you have a connection, you can subscribe to events to receive updates in real-time.\\n\\n```js\\nSocketConnection.on(event: SocketEvent, callback: (data: any) => void):\\n```\\n\\nUse the <b>on</b> method to subscribe to a socket event. This method takes an event name and a callback function as arguments. The callback function will be called whenever the specified event is triggered.\\n\\nThe following events are supported:\\n\\n- <b>EVENTS.CONNECT:</b> Triggered when the socket connection is established.\\n- <b>EVENTS.DISCONNECT:</b> Triggered when the socket connection is closed.\\n- <b>EVENTS.USER_FEEDS:</b> Triggered when a new notification is received by the user after the last socket connection.\\n- <b>EVENTS.USER_SPAM_FEEDS:</b> Triggered when a new spam notification is received by the user after the last socket connection.\\n- <b>EVENTS.CHAT_RECEIVED_MESSAGE:</b> Triggered when a new chat message is received.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```js\\nconst pushSDKSocket = createSocketConnection({\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb\',\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n  socketOptions: { autoConnect: false },\\n});\\npushSDKSocket.connect();\\npushSDKSocket.on(EVENTS.CONNECT, () => {\\n  console.log(\'Connected to socket!\');\\n});\\npushSDKSocket.on(EVENTS.DISCONNECT, () => {\\n  console.log(\'Disconnected from socket!\');\\n});\\npushSDKSocket.on(EVENTS.USER_FEEDS, (feedItem) => {\\n  console.log(`Received notification: ${feedItem.title}`);\\n});\\npushSDKSocket.on(EVENTS.USER_SPAM_FEEDS, (feedItem) => {\\n  console.log(`Received spam notification: ${feedItem.title}`);\\n});\\npushSDKSocket.on(EVENTS.CHAT_RECEIVED_MESSAGE, (message) => {\\n  console.log(`Received chat message: ${message.text}`);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\\n\\nThat\u2019s it!

Our mission has always been to empower the user experience on web3, and we\u2019re excited to see Push Chat and Push Group Chat take us one step closer to achieving this goal.\\n\\nCome check out Push Chat for yourself!\ud83d\udc49 https://app.push.org/#/chat\\n\\n## How Does Push Chat Work?\\n\\nWith Push Chat now available to the public, web3 users can enjoy a seamless, secure, and truly private messaging experience. Using advanced technologies such as IPFS, encryption, and message pinning on Push Nodes, Push Chat ensures a no-message drop experience for the users. Additionally, each message and notification carries a unique [verification proof](https://github.com/push-protocol/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification) that allows the front-end to confirm the authenticity of the sender and message content.\\n\\nPush Protocol first announced Push Chat at Devcon in October 2022. The alpha was released to select members of the Push community. We\u2019re excited now to make Push Chat available to anyone in the Push ecosystem.\\n\\nYou can learn more details about Push Nodes, sending and receiving messages on Push Chat, storage, and security of messages [here](https://medium.com/push-protocol/were-still-pushing-a-deeper-look-into-push-chat-90fdea8d9e8e).\\n\\n## Push Chat: Paving the Way for Decentralized Communication\\n\\nAs the web becomes more decentralized, it\u2019s crucial for applications to protect user data and prevent censorship. The Push Protocol team is taking on this fundamental problem in web3 with a two-step strategy that ensures [immutability of content](https://github.com/push-protocol/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification) and elimination of censorship.\\n\\n## What makes Push Chat an ideal messaging solution for web3 dapps and their users?\\n\\nFirst, it is a permissionless protocol, meaning that any address on any platform can use their account to chat with any other account across web3, without the need to sign up with personal information. Second, Push Chat is forward-compatible, allowing it to adapt to any changes made to existing or new platforms. This ensures Push Chat remains a reliable and adaptable solution. Third, the user-friendly interface of Push Chat provides a familiar user experience that users can quickly learn. Finally, our Push Chat SDK allows developers to easily integrate the messaging layer into their application or service, improving their CI/CD processes.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re looking to provide robust communication for your dapp and users, Push Chat is the solution you need!\\n\\n## Introducing Push Group Chat \u2014 A New Way to Collaborate on Push Chat\ud83e\udd1d\\n\\nSay hello to the newest addition to Push\u2019s communication solutions: Push Group Chat. Group Chat, inherent in its name, allows web3 users to create group chats, online communities, come together and share experiences natively on web3.\\n\\nWith the introduction of Group Chat, the potential use cases for Push Chat expand to include applications for DAOs, NFT communities, gaming, and more.\\n\\n![GroupChat](./image-1.png)\\n\\nAdditionally, since Push Chat is built on top of Push Nodes, if you choose to, every chat message sent or received can have notifications natively! All web2 communications start with a notification, so why should web3 be any different?\\n\\n## What are the Group Chat features?\\n\\nGroup Chat comes with several functionalities to enhance the chat experience on your dapp including:\\n\\n- Token gate your group: Choose to allow only addresses that hold an ERC20 or a certain NFT to be part of your group.\\n- Public or Private groups: Create transparent groups where the community can read the message content or private groups where only the group members can read the chat messages.\\n- Group Meta: Have fun with it! Select a funny group name, add a group description, and select your best group picture.\\n- Add/remove admins and members: Add and remove wallet addresses to the group or promote them to become group admins so they can change group information.\\n- Share Files: Not only can you chat with your web3 friends, but you can also share hilarious GIFs, awesome images, and even important files.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s more?

It takes the following props:\\n\\n- <b>notificationTitle</b> (string): The title of the notification.\\n- <b>notificationBody</b> (string): The body of the notification.\\n- <b>app</b> (string): The name of the app that sent the notification.\\n- <b>icon</b> (string): The URL of an icon to display next to the notification title.\\n- <b>image</b> (string): The URL of an image to display in the notification.\\n- <b>url</b> (string): The URL to open when the notification is clicked.\\n- <b>theme</b> (string): The theme to use for the notification. Possible values are \'light\' and \'dark\'.\\n- <b>chainName</b> (string): The name of the blockchain the notification was sent on. Possible values are \\"ETH_TEST_GOERLI\\", \\"POLYGON_TEST_MUMBAI\u201d.\\n- <b>isSpam</b> (boolean, optional): Set to true if the notification is spam.\\n- <b>subscribeFn</b> (function, optional): A function to call when the user clicks the \\"Opt-in\\" button on a spam notification.\\n- <b>isSubscribedFN</b> (function, optional): A function that returns a boolean indicating whether the user is subscribed to the spam notification\'s channel.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```js\\nimport { NotificationItem } from \'@pushprotocol/uiweb\';\\n\\nfunction MydApp() {\\n  const notifications = [\\n    {\\n      title: \'Notification 1\',\\n      message: \'This is the first notification\',\\n      app: \'My App\',\\n      icon: \'https://my-app.com/icon.png\',\\n      image: \'https://my-app.com/image.png\',\\n      url: \'https://my-app.com/notification-1\',\\n      blockchain: \'ETH_TEST_GOERLI\',\\n    },\\n    {\\n      title: \'Notification 2\',\\n      message: \'This is the second notification\',\\n      app: \'My App\',\\n      icon: \'https://my-app.com/icon.png\',\\n      image: \'https://my-app.com/image.png\',\\n      url: \'https://my-app.com/notification-2\',\\n      blockchain: \'ETH_TEST_GOERLI\',\\n    },\\n  ];\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      {notifications.map((notification, i) => (\\n        <NotificationItem\\n          key={i}\\n          notificationTitle={notification.title}\\n          notificationBody={notification.message}\\n          app={notification.app}\\n          icon={notification.icon}\\n          image={notification.image}\\n          url={notification.url}\\n          theme={{ background: \'blue\', color: \'white\' }}\\n          chainName={notification.blockchain}\\n        />\\n      ))}\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe <b>Notification Item</b> component can also be used to render spam notifications. To get the spam data, you can use the <b>PushAPI.user.getFeeds() </b> method with the <b>spam</b> parameter set to <b>true</b>.\\n\\nThe <b>NotificationItem</b> component is a general-purpose component that can be used to render any type of notification item, including spam notifications. It accepts props such as <b>notificationTitle, notificationBody, cta, app, icon, image,</b> and <b>url</b> to customize the appearance and behavior of the component.\\n\\nThe <b>Spam</b> component is a specialized variant of the <b>NotificationItem</b> component that is specifically designed for rendering spam notifications. It includes additional props such as <b>isSpam, subscribeFn,</b> and <b>isSubscribedFn</b> that allow the user to interact with the spam notification channel. It also includes an unsubscribe form that is displayed if the user is subscribed to the spam notification channel.\\n\\nYou can use the <b>PushAPI.user.getFeeds()</b> method with the <b>spam</b> parameter set to <b>true</b> to get the spam data. Here\'s an example of how you can use it:\\n\\n```js\\nconst spams = await PushAPI.user.getFeeds({\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  spam: true,\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nTo render the <b>Notification Item</b> component for each spam notification, you\'ll need to pass in the additional props <b>isSpam, subscribeFn,</b> and <b>isSubscribedFn</b>\\n\\n- isSpam: A boolean value indicating whether the notification is a spam notification\\n- subscribeFn: A function that opts the user in to the spam notification\'s channel\\n- isSubscribedFn: A function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the user is subscribed to the spam notification\'s channel\\n  Here\u2019s an example of how you can render the Notification Item component for each spam notification:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n  spams.map((oneNotification, i) => {\\n    const {\\n      cta,\\n      title,\\n      message,\\n      app,\\n      icon,\\n      image,\\n      url,\\n      blockchain,\\n      secret,\\n      notification,\\n    } = oneNotification;\\n\\n    return (\\n      <NotificationItem\\n        key={`spam-${i}`}\\n        notificationTitle={title}\\n        notificationBody={message}\\n        cta={cta}\\n        app={app}\\n        icon={icon}\\n        image={image}\\n        url={url}\\n        theme={theme}\\n        chainName={blockchain}\\n        isSpam={true}\\n        subscribeFn={subscribeFn}\\n        isSubscribedFn={isSubscribedFn}\\n      />\\n    );\\n  });\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo implement the <b>subscribeFn</b> and <b>isSubscribedFn</b> functions, you can use the <b>PushAPI.channel.subscribe()</b> and <b>PushAPI.channel.subscribe()</b> methods from @pushprotocol/restapi package, respectively.\\n\\nFor examples on how you can implement these functions, check out [PUSH-SDK Rest API blog post](https://medium.com/push-protocol/getting-started-with-push-sdk-rest-api-%EF%B8%8F-821e5b8389cc) we recently published.\\n\\nHere\u2019s an example of how you can implement these functions:\\n\\n```js\\nawait PushAPI.channels.subscribe({\\n  signer: _signer,\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  channel: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n\\nconst subscriptions = await PushAPI.user.getSubscriptions({\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Putting it all together\\n\\nHere is an example using <b>subscribeFn</b> that demonstrates the <b>uiweb</b> components used together.\\n\\n```js\\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \\"react\\";\\nimport { NotificationItem, chainNameType } from \\"@pushprotocol/uiweb\\";\\n\\nfunction MydApp() {\\n  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([]);\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n    const fetchNotifications = async () => {\\n      // fetch user notifications using the PushAPI\\n      const notifications = await PushAPI.user.getFeeds({\\n        user: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\', // user address in CAIP\\n        env: \'staging\'\\n      });\\n      setNotifications(notifications);\\n    };\\n    fetchNotifications();\\n  }, []);\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <h1>MydApp</h1>\\n      <h2>Notifications</h2>\\n      {notifications.map((notification, i) => {\\n        const {\\n          title,\\n          message,\\n          app,\\n          icon,\\n          image,\\n          url,\\n          blockchain\\n        } = notification;\\n        return (\\n          <NotificationItem\\n            key={i}\\n            notificationTitle={title}\\n            notificationBody={message}\\n            app={app}\\n            icon={icon}\\n            image={image}\\n            url={url}\\n            theme={theme}\\n            chainName={blockchain as chainNameType}\\n          />\\n        );\\n      })}\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<b>MydApp</b> is a component that renders a list of notifications and spam notifications, as well as a form for subscribing to or unsubscribing from spam notifications. It uses the following components from the <b>@pushprotocol/uiweb</b> package:\\n\\n- <b>NotificationItem:</b> A React component for rendering a single notification item.\\n- <b>Spam:</b> A React component for rendering a single spam notification item, with options for subscribing or unsubscribing to the spam notification channel.\\n- <b>Subscribe:</b> A React component for rendering a form for subscribing to a spam notification channel.\\n- <b>Unsubscribe:</b> A React component for rendering a form for unsubscribing from a spam notification channel.\\n\\n<b>MydApp</b> uses the <b>useState</b> and <b>useEffect</b> Hooks to fetch and display the user\'s notifications and spam notifications using the <b>PushAPI</b>. It also defines event handlers for subscribing to and unsubscribing from spam notifications.\\n\\n<b>MydApp</b> returns a JSX element that contains the following elements:\\n\\n- A <b>div</b> element with a <b>h1</b> element for the title of the application and a <b>h2</b> element for the section heading for the notifications.\\n- A loop that renders a <b>NotificationItem</b> component for each notification in the <b>notifications</b> array.\\n- A <b>h2</b> element for the section heading for the spam notifications.\\n- A loop that renders a <b>Spam</b> component for each spam notification in the <b>spamNotifications</b> array.\\n- A <b>h2</b> element for the section heading for the subscription form.\\n- An <b>Unsubscribe</b> component if the user is subscribed to spam notifications, or a <b>Subscribe</b> component if the user is not subscribed to spam notifications.\\n\\nThere are of course other React components that you can to compliment the uiweb API. For instance: the <b>Feed </b>component is a container for displaying a list of notifications in a UI. It takes the following props:\\n\\n- notifications (array of Notification objects): An array of notifications to be displayed in the feed. Each Notification object should have the following shape:\\n- <b>cta</b> (string): The call-to-action text for the notification.\\n- <b>title</b> (string): The title of the notification.\\n- <b>message</b> (string): The body of the notification.\\n- <b>app</b> (string): The name of the app that sent the notification.\\n- <b>icon</b> (string): The URL of an icon to be displayed with the notification.\\n- <b>image</b> (string): The URL of an image to be displayed with the notification.\\n- <b>url</b> (string): The URL to be opened when the notification is clicked.\\n- <b>blockchain</b> (string): The name of the blockchain on which the notification was sent.\\n- <b>theme</b>(Theme object): An object defining the colors and styles to be used in the feed. The Theme object should have the following shape:\\n- <b>background</b> (string): The background color of the feed.\\n- <b>color</b> (string): The text color of the feed.\\n- <b>chainName</b> (string): The name of the blockchain to be displayed in the feed.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```js\\nimport NotificationItem from \'@pushprotocol/uiweb/NotificationItem\';\\nimport Feed from \'./Feed\'; // User-implemented component\\n\\nconst notifications = [\\n  {\\n    cta: \'Learn More\',\\n    title: \'Notification 1\',\\n    message: \'This is the first notification\',\\n    app: \'My App\',\\n    icon: \'<https://my-app.com/icon.png>\',\\n    image: \'<https://my-app.com/image.png>\',\\n    url: \'<https://my-app.com/notification-1>\',\\n    blockchain: \'Ethereum\',\\n  },\\n  {\\n    cta: \'Get Started\',\\n    title: \'Notification 2\',\\n    message: \'This is the second notification\',\\n    app: \'My App\',\\n    icon: \'<https://my-app.com/icon.png>\',\\n    image: \'<https://my-app.com/image.png>\',\\n    url: \'<https://my-app.com/notification-2>\',\\n    blockchain: \'Ethereum\',\\n  },\\n];\\nfunction MydApp() {\\n  return (\\n    <Feed\\n      notifications={notifications}\\n      theme={{ background: \'blue\', color: \'white\' }}\\n      chainName=\'Ethereum\'\\n    />\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThat\u2019s it! You now know how to use the components of the <b>@pushprotocol/uiweb</b> API to add push notification functionality to your application.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll cover the other parts of the SDK in the coming posts.

They allow any centralized or decentralized platform to receive communications from Push Storage Nodes, which validate and index all communications and link them to a user\u2019s wallet address and multi-chain identity.\\n\\nDevelopers can run these nodes on their backend to connect their web2 infrastructure to web3 communication, allowing for extended communication beyond web3 wallet addresses to web2 platform users. Push Delivery Nodes enable mapping any web2 device token or platform username to a specific web3 wallet address, which can then send alerts to web2 or web2.5 platforms.\\n\\nExamples of platforms that can be reached include crypto wallet apps, mobile apps, browser extensions, Telegram and Discord bots, email alerts, and more.\\n\\nFor a pure web3 experience, listening to Push Storage Nodes or utilizing their RPC endpoints/SDK is the best option. However, if you\u2019re a developer looking to extend these communication experiences to centralized platforms, you need to use Push Delivery Nodes.\\n\\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.png)\\n\\n## 7 Steps for Getting Started With the Delivery Node Module\ud83c\udf31\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\n- MYSQL (Version >= 5.7)\\n- Redis (Version >= 6.0)\\n- Docker (For local setup)\\n- Google FCM Account Setup\\n\\n### Step 1: Clone Push delivery node repo\\n\\nGit clone can be found here: https://github.com/push-protocol/push-delivery-node.git\\n\\n### Step 2: Environment configuration\\n\\nRefer env sample file.

With our new launch, the door is wide open for the Push ecosystem to grow dramatically and bring on new exciting use cases for our communication solutions.\\n\\nWith this announcement, we\u2019re excited to introduce our BNB launch Collaborators who are collaborating with Push on various use cases to bring web3 native notification and messaging to users across the BNB ecosystem.\\n\\n### Push and BNB: Decentralized communication to power web3 UX\\n\\nUsing Push, BNB dapp developers can begin adding notification services to their dapps, building custom communication channels, and enabling wallet-to-wallet communication for users (check out [this guide](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/tutorials/enabling-channel-on-other-chains/) for getting started). For end-users, this means enhanced capacity to stay updated on critical information relevant to their favorite dapps.\\n\\nThe BNB notification ecosystem will be available through the primary Push Protocol app: [app.push.org](http://app.push.org/). For users, you can follow this [user guide](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/s) to begin opting-in to channels.\\n\\nThis integration is a major step forward in Push\u2019s mission to provide seamless and decentralized web3 communication and we are thrilled to have eight new frens from BNB joining our mission.\\n\\nLet\u2019s explore some interesting use cases these frens are deploying with Push.\\n\\n### Staying updated about critical events with Push notifications\\n\\nFor a powerful DEX aggregator like 1inch [Network](https://1inch.io/), rapid changes in token prices among various DEXes create the need for quick notifications. Thanks to Push, 1inch is now updating users on exchange rates, limit order executions, and expiry statuses eliminating the need for continuous monitoring of token exchange rates. Additionally, 1inch DAO can now send new governance proposal notifications directly to members\u2019 wallet addresses using Push. 1inchers can [opt-in](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x1a9dDEf485674fC60a269cf97FAbc6b8728A3497) to the channel now, and start receiving notifications.\\n\\nCEX and DEX liquidity aggregator, [Orion Protocol](https://www.orionprotocol.io/), is the single point of access to the crypto market, combining the top crypto exchanges into [one order book](https://trade.orionprotocol.io/). Through Push\u2019s seamless wallet-to-wallet technology, the Orion team can now keep users informed of their [developments](https://blog.orionprotocol.io/terminalupdates) via Push notifications.\\n\\nWith an ever-growing DeFi ecosystem and an increasing amount of on-chain activity, constant innovation is required to accommodate the growing needs of DeFi users. For one, users need to be updated about their positions and market conditions. Having to stay on top of market conditions and portfolio statutes 24/7 is exhausting. This is where notifications and real-time alerts prove useful.\\n\\nDeFi apps that require active management of positions can often lead to forgotten collateral and live loan positions. By sending real-time insights and liquidation alerts to users, liquidation can be avoided. For other critical events like price swings and changes in vault strategies, users can be notified to prompt timely action on their portfolios.\\n\\n### Improving access to DeFi tools\\n\\nUse cases are being established with [Apeswap](https://apeswap.finance/) to enhance access to DeFi tools like staking and farming. By alerting users when a new pool launches or new bonds are issued, users are given all the information they need to participate in the latest pool on time. Users can [opt-in](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x0e255B1900b8cE23f8E818C7Ee08cfd5b41df748) to the channel now, and start receiving notifications.\\n\\n[ZeroSwap](https://zeroswap.io/) is another protocol taking advantage of Push notifications to assist users with their trading strategies by updating them with the latest price information.\\n\\n### Enhanced governance and community participation\\n\\nAlmost every protocol that\u2019s integrated Push is utilizing notifications to also enhance governance on their platform. For DAOs and decentralized exchanges like Sushi, community participation is key to the growth of their network.\\n\\nTo enable this trust and distributed decision-making, users need to stay on top of what\u2019s happening. For [Sushi](https://www.sushi.com/), Push notifications are being used to update users about upcoming governance proposals within the forum as well as a medium for connecting with the community. Sushi channel is now live on Push, [opt-in here](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x458E4E1877F2F0D6752bD6f6DFd2e9048C2A56b3).\\n\\nDeFi apps like [Thena](https://thena.fi/) are implementing Push notifications to notify users to timely vote on their staking rewards program. Users can opt-in to [Thena channel](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xC59c69342eb0bF2635dac683e44cEB2A18a5C38d) now.\\n\\nGovernance is better with Push!\\n\\n### Increasing player retention and enhancing the Metaverse experience\\n\\nMetaverse and NFT gaming have been all the rage recently. But while the Metaverse space garners a lot of attention, lacking native web3 communication remains a major challenge. NFT-gaming platform, [Wombat](https://www.wombat.app/), is solving this problem by integrating Push into their platform. For an ecosystem that relies heavily on player-to-player interactions, native communication tools can go a long way in enhancing the overall UX of Wombat.\\n\\n[SecondLive](https://secondlive.world/), a create-to-earn open Metaverse, is also committed to providing the best user experience and is working with Push to enable native web3 communication within their Metaverse. By enabling Push notifications and Chat, SecondLive is able to create a decentralized and transparent communication channel between its platform and users.\\n\\n### Pushing for success together with Frens\\n\\nWhile a lot of interesting use cases have already been established with our new frens, this is only the start of an exciting journey on BNB Chain. There are a ton of applications for communication tools yet to be explored and we cannot wait to get started.\\n\\nStay updated on BNB Chain: [Website](https://www.bnbchain.org/en), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN), [Telegram](https://t.me/bnbchain), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BNBChainOfficial), [Discord](https://discord.gg/bnbchain), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bnbchaininnovation/), [Build N\u2019 Build Forum](https://www.buildnbuild.dev/), [Dev Community](https://bnbdev.community/)"},{"id":"push-protocol-launches-on-bnb-chain","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-protocol-launches-on-bnb-chain","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-15-push-protocol-launches-on-bnb-chain/index.md","title":"Push Protocol Launches on BNB Chain!\ud83d\udc9b","description":"Cover image of Push Protocol Launches on BNB Chain!\ud83d\udc9b","date":"2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 15, 2023","tags":[{"label":"BNB","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/bnb"},{"label":"BNBChain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/bnb-chain"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"}],"readingTime":1.8733333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-protocol-launches-on-bnb-chain","title":"Push Protocol Launches on BNB Chain!\ud83d\udc9b","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.gif","text":"Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that Push Protocol is launching on the BNB Chain mainnets!

This means the largest web3 communication platform is now available to BNB\u2019s ecosystem of thousands of dapps and hundreds of thousands of daily users.\\n\\nBack in September 2022, Push launched on Polygon\u2019s mainnet, signaling our first step into becoming <i>the</i> multi-chain communication protocol for all of web3. Staying true to our commitment of an interoperable future, the next chain to support Push Protocol is BNB Chain.\\n\\nThe launch of Push Protocol on BNB Chain will enable <i>Push Notifications</i> and <i>Push Chat</i>. Read on to learn more.\\n\\n### Push Notifications on BNB Chain\\n\\nTo date, Push Protocol has powered over 25 million notifications to +70,000 subscribers across the Ethereum and Polygon networks. The BNB Chain launch will allow existing BNB dapps and developers to launch and create their own channels and offer customized notifications in response to on- and off-chain events.\\n\\nAny application or individual can launch a notification channel starting today. At launch, 1inch, Sushi, Thena, and Apeswap channels will be live for mainnet notifications.\\n\\nBNB Chain will be implementing Push Smart Contracts v1.5, the newest upgrade to the Push Protocol. Push v1.5 upgrades provide imperative features including <i>channel creation with PUSH token, enabling notifications using Subgraph, inclusion of EIP-1271, etc.</i> Additionally, it also enables extra customization, including time-bound channels and editable channel details. The Protocol Fee Pool in v1.5 will deduct 10 PUSH from the original staked amount (minimum 50 PUSH to create a channel) for any critical transaction (like creation, reactivation, or detail modification). As part of the upcoming v2 release, the Protocol Fee Pool will have more functionality \u2014 including allowing protocol users to claim rewards and distributing funds to wallets that integrate Push Protocol. [Learn more about Push v1.5!](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-push-protocol-v1-5-80eb39b55424)\\n\\nAll of these features will be enabled for BNB Chain notifications starting today. The BNB notification ecosystem will be available through the primary Push Protocol app: [app.push.org](http://app.push.org/). In order to create and enable your channel for the BNB Chain, you can follow [this guide](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/tutorials/create-your-channel/) to ensure the complete setup is done adequately.\\n\\n### Push Chat on BNB Chain\\n\\nIn October, Push Protocol announced our alpha for Push Chat \u2014 p2p web3 native chat between on-chain addresses. Push Chat is enabled for Ethereum and Polygon addresses, and with the BNB Chain launch, whitelisted addresses can now chat through BNB Chain as well. We\u2019ll have more information about the continued rollout of Push Chat, so stay tuned on the [Push Protocol Twitter.](https://x.com/PushChain)\\n\\n### Existing Push Ethereum & Polygon Users\\n\\nTo existing Push Protocol users on Ethereum and Polygon \u2014 say hello to the BNB Chain communities! And get ready for more mainnet announcements down the road. With today\u2019s BNB announcement, no action is needed by Ethereum and Polygon users. All notifications and channels will remain functional, as will PUSH staking and rewards.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBack in September with the Push Protocol rebrand, we made a promise to build out the multi-chain communication protocol for all of web3. With the Polygon and Push Chat launches, we started our journey. With today\u2019s BNB Chain launch, we\u2019re continuing that promise to the Push community and to web3 at large.\\n\\nLet\u2019s #PUSH for web3 communication!\\n\\n#PoweredbyPush"},{"id":"push-and-phuture-finance-team-up-to-enhance-user-engagement","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-and-phuture-finance-team-up-to-enhance-user-engagement","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-09-push-and-phuture-finance-team/index.md","title":"Push and Phuture Finance Team Up to Enhance User Engagement\ud83d\udc0b","description":"Cover image of Push and Phuture Finance Team Up to Enhance User Engagement\ud83d\udc0b","date":"2023-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 9, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Frensofpush","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/frensofpush"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Blockchain Technology","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain-technology"}],"readingTime":2.44,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-and-phuture-finance-team-up-to-enhance-user-engagement","title":"Push and Phuture Finance Team Up to Enhance User Engagement\ud83d\udc0b","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"This week, we are glad to feature our fren and the leading crypto index platform \u2014 Phuture Finance.

Communication plays a significant role in this regard and Push is glad to be the solutions provider! By collaborating with Push, Phuture delivers investment updates directly to its users, thereby enabling a culture of transparency on the platform.\\n\\nFor this episode of \u201cFrens of Push\u201d, we sat down with Oliver Mehr, co-founder of\\nPhuture Finance to talk about Phuture\u2019s mission of enabling transparency in the DeFi realm and how Push is helping further this mission.\\n\\n### Hi Oliver, how did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What\u2019s your story?\\n\\nI became involved in crypto in late 2016 when the family office that I was working for at the time started to invest in crypto. It started off with just Bitcoin and Ethereum but grew from there, participating in the ICO boom and ultimately culminating in the creation of a venture fund, SVK Crypto, to invest in early-stage blockchain-based businesses. After fully deploying the capital for that fund and realizing the potential that decentralized finance had to offer, we began building Phuture.\\n\\n### Tell us about Phuture \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem does Phuture solve?\\n\\nPhuture is a decentralized protocol that gives users passive exposure to crypto assets. Phuture creates on-chain index funds and structured products so anyone can get exposure to crypto without the complexity of managing each asset individually. Phuture\u2019s products are built with best-in-class methodologies and audited to the highest standards.\\n\\nHere\u2019s how it looks:\\n\\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.png)\\n\\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-2.png)\\n\\n### What\u2019s your 2023 plan for Phuture?\\n\\nIn 2023, we plan to take on-chain index funds and structured products to the next level with the launch of Phuture V2 a next-generation non-custodial asset management protocol. We will be releasing more details about Phuture V2 as we get closer to the launch so make sure to stay updated through our socials.\\n\\n### How is Phuture using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\nPhuture is leveraging the Push protocol to create a communication channel with our users that relies solely on their wallet address and no other personal information. Through our channel, we send our users weekly updates on the performance of their portfolio as well as notify them when we rebalance our index products.\\n\\n<blockquote><i>Engaging with your users in web3 has been an ongoing problem and we believe that through Push we can provide our users with both general updates on our products as well as notifications tailored to their Phuture portfolio. Ultimately, we believe the integration of web3 notifications into Phuture will drastically improve the user experience over time.</i></blockquote>\\n\\n### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\nPush provides ample flexibility for us to utilize our subgraph data within our notifications to deliver accurate, account-tailored information the moment an on-chain event occurs, the timestamp is met or the transaction is triggered.\\n\\n### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\nWe are most excited about seeing Push get integrated directly into consumer wallets so that notifications can be sent straight to a person\u2019s wallet.

Whether it\u2019s employee payroll, web3 subscriptions, or real-time investing, the need for ongoing money transfers has become more important than ever. Superfluid solves this exact problem by enabling continuous money streaming, thereby helping users, developers, and projects simplify recurring value transfer in web3.\\n\\nWith a single on-chain transaction, Superfluid allows users to send ongoing money streams that transfer value second by second in a constant flow. In effect, crypto-native organizations can now ensure a smooth and efficient flow of money to multiple employees or contributors on a recurring basis or receive on-chain subscription revenue.\\n\\n## Push X Superfluid\\n\\nAs a money-streaming platform, Superfluid empowers individuals and organizations to handle payments and subscriptions in a trustless, decentralized manner. The creation of such an ecosystem calls for a transparent communication model between Superfluid and its users. This is precisely where Push comes in!\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<i>\\n\'We\u2019re incredibly excited to integrate with Push. Although our ecosystem has seen tremendous growth to date, it\u2019s difficult to build engaging web3 apps without having a direct communication channel with users. This is especially challenging when users are primarily identified by their wallet addresses.\\n\\nWith Push, we can now provide users with time-sensitive notifications in a secure, decentralized, and personalized way.\' \u2014 Francesco Renzi, CEO and Co-Founder of Superfluid\\n</i>\\n\\n</blockquote>\\n\\nWith this collaboration, Superfluid users can opt-in to notifications through the Push apps for when:\\n\\n- Super Token balances are low for outgoing streams\\n- A Super Token balance hit zero and outgoing streams were liquidated\\n  As a result of this integration, Superfluid will have a verified channel on Push that users or developers can try out to subscribe to alerts and updates about their streams directly on their devices.\\n\\nIn the near future, Push will feature as part of Superfluid Dashboard notifications, and we hope that many others in the Superfluid ecosystem make use of these capabilities too.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<i>\\n\'We\u2019re thrilled to announce our partnership with Superfluid, a pioneer in web3 money streaming. By combining Push\u2019s web3-native communication tools with Superfluid\u2019s innovative payment primitive, we\u2019re enabling a truly seamless and connected web3 experience for Superfluid users.\\n\\nHowever, this is just the first stage of our integration with Superfluid and we can\u2019t wait to provide more enhancements in the near future!\' \u2014 Harsh Rajat, CEO of Push Protocol\\n</i>\\n\\n</blockquote>\\n\\nPush is excited to be encouraging financial flexibility with Superfluid, and looks forward to individuals and businesses having greater awareness around their streams!\\n\\nBeyond that, we are looking forward to delivering more decentralized notifications to Superfluid users in the coming months enabling deeper notification integration for future versions of Superfluid.\\n\\nThe user experience enhancements for Superfluid users is only just beginning!\\n\\n<b>#PoweredbyPush</b>\\n\\nIf you need help subscribing to the Superfluid channel, you can check out [this helpful walkthrough document here](https://help.superfluid.finance/en/articles/6974092-superfluid-push-channel).\\n\\n## About Superfluid\\n\\n[Superfluid](http://superfluid.finance/) is the leading asset streaming protocol that enables web3 native subscriptions, salaries, and rewards for DAOs and crypto-native businesses. Superfluid streams transfer value in a constant flow over time between wallets in a non-custodial and permissionless manner. Superfluid Protocol can be used to describe cash flows and execute them automatically on-chain, over time, and in a non-interactive way.\\n\\nMoney streams are programmable, composable, and modular, allowing developers to build custom applications on top of the protocol. No capital is locked up, and all inflows and outflows are netted in real-time at every block without consuming any gas. Ongoing streams can be forwarded as they are received to both wallets and applications, eliminating delays and drastically increasing capital efficiency.\\n\\n[Website](https://www.superfluid.finance/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/superfluid_HQ), [Github](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JrnpZWymeU), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/superfluid/)"},{"id":"january-monthly-recap","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/january-monthly-recap","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-02-january-monthly-recap/index.md","title":"January Monthly Recap\u2744\ufe0f","description":"Cover image of January Monthly Recap\u2744\ufe0f","date":"2023-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 2, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Devtools","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/devtools"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Push Notification","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-notification"}],"readingTime":2.3966666666666665,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"january-monthly-recap","title":"January Monthly Recap\u2744\ufe0f","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.png","text":"Welcome to our monthly update!

That\u2019s Wherever for you. The platform enables web3 dapps to communicate with wallets directly, no matter where they are. Communication wherever, literally!\\n\\nBy way of this collaboration, Push provides Wherever the infrastructure to facilitate wallet communication with an emphasis on personalization, automation, and user experience. Wherever relies on Push\u2019s communication layer to deliver in-app notifications while ensuring a decentralized relay and storage.\\n\\nIn this episode of \u201cFrens of Push\u201d, Amos joins us to talk about how the pilot collaboration between Push and Wherever has the potential to disrupt web3 communication.\\n\\n## Hi Amos, how did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What\u2019s your story?\\n\\n<b>Amos:</b> Before I started working on Wherever, I founded an airline communication startup, helping the biggest airlines in the world communicate with their passengers during flight disruptions. Working with web2 communication infrastructure at a large scale really showed me how fragmented and antiquated it is. Dominated by either siloed walled gardens or out-of-date messaging protocols, the digital communication space was broken. In search of other alternatives, I came across the potential of web3 to disrupt this huge space and decided that I have to join this revolution. And so together with my two amazing friends and co-founders, Niv Oppenhaim and Ido Goldberg, we started Wherever on a mission to help create an internet where users can communicate with anyone from wherever.\\n\\n### Tell us about Wherever \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem does Wherever solve?\\n\\n<b>Amos:</b> Wherever is a wallet-first communication platform. We help web3 projects communicate directly with wallets, wherever they are. Today, dapps and communities struggle to rise above the noise on Twitter and Discord, lacking a more personalized channel with their users. On top of the clutter, the web3 identity gap forces projects to \u201cspray and pray\u201d in these web2 platforms, engaging users without understanding their on-chain activity and ownership.\\n\\nWherever provides product and community managers with the tools to grow a direct web3 communication channel with their users, and leverage web3 messaging protocols to send messages directly to their wallets. Our platform is comprised of three main components \u2014 Subscriber Growth tools, Broadcasting Studio, and Web3 Inbox.\\n\\nGrowth tools are basically APIs, widgets, and Discord bots that help collect web3 subscribers and enable them to connect web2 channels, such as email and Telegram, without compromising their privacy. In the Studio, marketers can broadcast personalized campaigns directly to their users\u2019 wallets based on their digital ownership, and PMs can use our no-code builder to create automated notifications based on the users on-chain activity. Lastly, we enable dapps and Wallet Apps to embed a web3 inbox and empower their users to tap into decentralized and secure messaging.\\n\\n### What\u2019s your 2023 plan for Wherever?\\n\\n<b>Amos:</b> First, we believe that 2023 will be the year of wallet-to-wallet communication! Every project in the space will add web3 native messaging channels to build trust with their users, drive engagement, and foster stronger relationships.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll be focusing this year on helping dapps onboard their users to this next-gen digital communication, and leverage the messaging protocols to send the right message, at the right time, to the right wallet. Furthermore, we will be introducing cool new ways to create wallet-first loyalty & ambassador programs, user research surveys, customer support, airdrops, and more!\\n\\n### How is Wherever using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\n<b>Amos:</b> Wherever leverages Push\u2019s communication layer to send messages directly to users\u2019 wallets. Push enables us to focus on personalization, automation, and UX while they provide the infrastructure to manage the relay and storage of the messages. Together, we are able to offer any web3 project a communication experience that is on par with web2 but completely decentralized and interoperable. This unlocks a completely new and radically different experience \u2014 your inbox, wherever you go!\\n\\n### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\n<b>Amos:</b> Interactive Messages! Besides interoperability and this notion of \u201cyour inbox, wherever\u201d, interactive messaging could be web3\u2019s killer feature. As Gabby Goldberg coined it, \u201ctalking to the protocol\u201d, means that the recipient of the message is the protocol itself. Interactive Messages would enable users to do almost everything through the chat interface \u2014 send money to a friend, submit an NFT offer, or vote on a new DAO proposal. This will take web3 from \u201cbeing on par with web2\u201d, to \u201ckicking web2 in the a\\\\*\\\\*\u201d!\\n\\n### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\n<b>Amos:</b> The experience so far has been great! We look forward to collaborating and helping more web3 projects leverage the Push protocol to engage their users in more delightful ways. Shoutout to Madeline and Richa for being such great partners to us!\\n\\n---\\n\\nThanks Amos for the awesome conversation.

Using the SDK, developers can:\\n\\n- Build PUSH features into their dapps\\n- Get access to Push Nodes APIs\\n- Render Push Notifications UI\\n\\nIt is written in Typescript and supports React, React Native, Plain JS, and Node JS-based platforms. (We are adding support for more!) It is also built on top of standard Web3 packages like <b>ethers, @web3-react</b>.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re looking for our full documentation on [Push-SDK REST API, you can find that here](https://comms.push.org/docs).\\n\\nBut for now, let\u2019s walk you through the main features of the Push-SDK REST API and how to use them in your code.\\n\\n## Fetching user notifications\\n\\nYou can use the <b>getFeeds</b> method to fetch a user\'s notifications. This method takes an options object as an argument, which allows you to specify the following parameters:\\n\\n- <b>user</b> (mandatory, string): The user\u2019s address in CAIP format.\\n- <b>page</b> (optional, number): The page index of the results. Default is 1.\\n- <b>limit</b> (optional, number): The number of items per page. Default is 10.\\n- <b>spam</b> (optional, boolean): Whether to fetch spam notifications. Default is false.\\n- <b>env</b> (optional, string): The API environment to use. Possible values are \u2018prod\u2019 and \u2018staging\u2019. Default is \u2018prod\u2019.\\n- <b>raw</b> (optional, boolean): Whether to return the raw, unformatted API response. Default is <b>false</b>.\\n\\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might use the <b>getFeeds</b> method in your code:\\n\\n```js\\nconst notifications = await PushAPI.user.getFeeds({\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we define a user address using the CAIP format. CAIP, or Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal, is a way to describe standards for blockchain projects that are not specific to a single chain. It was developed by the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process and is used to identify and encode information about Ethereum addresses, contract addresses, and other crypto-assets.\\n\\nIt is important to note that CAIP is not a standardized way of identifying and encoding information about crypto-assets; it is under development by the Ethereum community and is not yet widely adopted in the ecosystem.\\n\\nCAIP addresses are composed of three parts:\\n\\n- <b>The namespace:</b> This is a string designed to uniquely identify a blockchain ecosystem or set of ecosystems as a namespace.\\n- <b>The network ID:</b> This is an integer that identifies the Ethereum network the asset belongs to. For example, 1 is the main network, 3 is the Ropsten test network, 5 is the Goerli test network, and 11155111 is Sepolia test network.\\n- <b>The address:</b> This is the actual address of the asset, encoded as a hexadecimal string.\\n\\nFor instance:\\n\\n```js\\neip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the namespace is eip155 which identifies EVM chains, the network ID is 5 (Goerli test network) and the address is <b>0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681</b>.\\n\\nCAIP is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for the inclusion of additional information as needed. It is used by the Push Protocol and other Ethereum-based projects as a standardized way of identifying and encoding information about crypto-assets, and distinguishing information from different chains.\\n\\nContinuing with <b>getFeeds</b>, to fetch spam notifications, set the <b>spam</b> parameter to <b>true</b>:\\n\\n```js\\nconst spams = await PushAPI.user.getFeeds({\\n  user: \'eip155:11155111:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681\',\\n  spam: true,\\n  env: \'staging\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe <b>getFeeds</b> method returns a list of notifications for the specified user.\\n\\n## Fetching user subscriptions\\n\\nYou can use the <b>getSubscriptions</b> method to fetch a user\'s subscriptions.

If you want to be featured, reach out to us and you could be our next Fren in the series.\\n</i>\\n\\nThis week, we\u2019re delighted to have on a leading decentralized stablecoin protocol and our fren, QiDao, to talk about their journey with Push.\\n\\nA bit about [QiDao](https://www.mai.finance/). How do you keep your crypto assets while still being able to spend their value? QiDao stablecoin protocol allows you to lock your tokens out of circulation and be used as collateral to borrow stablecoins. As a borrowing and lending protocol, QiDao is self-sustained, community-run, and completely decentralized.\\n\\nFor a borrowing protocol, updating its users about their debt positions is immensely important to keep their positions from liquidating. This is where Push steps in. By sending Push notifications directly to users, QiDao is able to update users about the health of their debt positions, thereby preventing potential losses.\\n\\nIn this episode of \u2018Frens of Push\u2019, we sat down with [Benjamin](https://twitter.com/Benjamin918_) from QiDao to talk about the problem QiDao is trying to solve, their vision, and their journey with Push.\\n\\n### Hi Benjamin, how did you first get involved in building in the blockchain space? What\u2019s your story?\\n\\n<b>Benjamin:</b> I\u2019ve been in crypto for a few years now. Started launching some infrastructure projects in early blockchains. When the DeFi movement really started, that became more of my focus.\\n\\n### Tell us about QiDao \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem does QiDAO solve?\\n\\n<b>Benjamin:</b> QiDao is a stablecoin protocol that allows you to mint MAI against the value of your tokens. What makes MAI special is that you can mint it natively against your favorite collaterals on your favorite chains. As a result, you don\u2019t have to trust bridges to access stablecoins. You can create them on your chain.\\n\\nAdditionally, MAI loans are 0% interest, so your debt amount does not change. QiDao only charges a 0.5% repayment fee, which stays constant in value no matter when you repay.\\n\\n### What\u2019s your 2023 plan for QiDao?\\n\\n<b>Benjamin:</b> We have a ton planned for 2023. Here are the 3 I\u2019m most excited about.\\n\\nA stability pool to liquidate debt positions at QiDao will soon be rolled out. This will offer MAI holders a new yield opportunity that won\u2019t rely on inflationary tokenomics. It will also have a component for arbitrageurs to buy collateral assets with MAI at a fixed MAI price of $1.\\n\\nLiquidation-protected vaults. Our team is working on vaults that will protect users from being liquidated. What\u2019s interesting about this product is that it will be fully onchain, unlike alternative liquidation protection products.\\n\\nWe\u2019re one of a handful of protocols alpha-testing Chainlink\u2019s brand new CCIP \u2014 a cross-chain messaging system. QiDao will likely use this for cross-chain governance and improved bridging.\\n\\n### How is QiDao using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\n<b>Benjamin:</b> When users take loans in crypto, they have to be very careful to maintain the collateralization of their debt position. Otherwise, those debt positions can be liquidated.\\n\\nAt QiDao, we use Push so that users can stay up to date with the health of their debt positions. This can help prevent unnecessary user losses. In general, users trust Push given their OG status in crypto and their amazing track record.\\n\\n### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\n<b>Benjamin:</b> It\u2019s amazing! We had people tell us for months that they wanted this integration so it\u2019s great to have this utility. What\u2019s best is that it\u2019s simple to use. And that\u2019s what has brought so many of our users to the platform.\\n\\n### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\n<b>Benjamin:</b> What Push is really good for is keeping people\u2019s attention. Because normally you exit a dapp and that\u2019s it- no more engagement. Take a look at sites like Twitter, which are always trying to get you back. Push can be a powerful tool for user engagement.\\n\\nThank you, Benjamin, for taking the time to speak with us. We look forward to accelerating your growth and helping bring value to your users.\\n\\n## About QiDao\\n\\nQiDao is Polygon\u2019s first native stablecoin protocol (and is now supported by multiple chains) that functions on an over-collateralized debt position model. The protocol allows its users to borrow $MAI or miMatic stablecoin against their decentralized token collaterals.\\n\\nFind out more about QiDao: [Website](https://app.mai.finance/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/QiDaoProtocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mQq55j65xJ), [Docs](https://docs.mai.finance/introduction-1)\\n\\n<i>\\n    \u201cPush frens\u201d is our weekly content series to spotlight outstanding projects building with Push.

Instead, it depends on a distributed network of nodes to handle and route data between users. This ensures communication is resistant to censorship, tampering, and other forms of interference, as well as be able to function even if some nodes go offline.\\n\\nIn this way, a universal communication layer is accessible to all users regardless of their device or platform. This is essential in the web3 space, as users will often have a variety of different devices and platforms that they need to interact with to access and use a dApp.\\n\\n## What does it take to build a web3 communication layer?\\n\\nIn general, to build a decentralized and universal communication layer, several vital components are required, including:\\n\\n- <b>Robust Network Architecture:</b> The network architecture of a decentralized communication layer must be designed to ensure that data can be reliably and efficiently routed between nodes, even in the event of node failures or network congestion.\\n- <b>Data storage:</b> Decentralized communication systems typically rely on distributed data storage to ensure that data is stored redundantly across multiple nodes, making it less vulnerable to data loss or corruption.\\n- <b>Consensus:</b> A consensus mechanism ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the system\u2019s state. This is particularly important in decentralized systems, as there is no central authority to ensure that all nodes are in sync. Network maintainers must verify and finalize message data for a communication layer to function.\\n- <b>Security:</b> Securing a decentralized communication system is a significant concern, as there are a variety of potential attack vectors that could be used to compromise the security of the system. A communication layer must consider encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure the safety of the users\u2019 data.\\n- <b>Interoperability:</b> A universal communication layer must interact seamlessly with various devices and platforms, so a communication protocol needs to ensure that the system can handle different data formats and protocols.\\n- <b>Composable:</b> A communication layer must be able to adapt to a variety of conditions and improve as required. This includes the incorporation of new technologies and web-based systems.\\n\\nWith these components, a web3 communication layer can offer censorship-resistant, privacy-preserving, and spam-protected communication while being chain-agnostic, gasless, and scalable\\n\\n## Are we still Pushing? We\u2019re always Pushing.\\n\\nBuilding a decentralized communication layer is a process, not a product, meaning it\u2019s not something that can be fully achieved but rather something that requires consistent development.\\n\\nThe team at [Push Protocol](https://push.org/) is continuously working on improving its architecture by crafting and refining the key components for building a communication layer. With a strong focus on security and performance, Push is working to bring the best decentralized communication tools possible to the web3 space.\\n\\nAs a result, the Push Protocol community continues to rapidly evolve and is getting closer to reaching its goal of enabling millions of users and devices to communicate simultaneously across web3.

If you want to be featured, reach out to us and you could be our next Fren in the series.\\n</i>\\n\\nSince its conception, the goal of [Developer DAO](https://www.developerdao.com/) has been to onboard, educate, and support web3 developers with all the tools they need to successfully build the next generation of web3 projects. With over 5,000+ members from around the world, it\u2019s safe to say the Developer DAO mission to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders has been widely accepted.\\n\\nFor a DAO that relies on the participation of its members to operate effectively, communication remains an integral component. By [integrating Push Notifications](https://medium.com/push-protocol/developer-dao-x-push-enhancing-ux-through-web3-communication-tools-7538b5656d43), the D_D community can now enhance its communication capacities and hence UX, by enabling members to better stay updated on the latest governance proposals, forum topics, and other important updates.\\n\\nIn this episode of \u201cFrens of Push\u201d, we are in conversation with [Krinza](https://twitter.com/kayprasla) from Developer DAO to talk about how Push\u2019s communication layer is powering the D_D community.\\n\\n### Hi Krinza, how did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What\u2019s your story?\\n\\nKrinza: Before joining web3 full-time, I was working in my capacity as a data scientist building AI products. My first year working in that role was all fun and games until the work started to feel redundant. It was no longer about the thrill of solving a problem anymore, but the drudgery of making the exact pipelines run in similar ways or applying them to different problems.\\n\\nThis made me start exploring blockchain in my spare time. I was already enveloped in crypto and had explored the NFT space to its fullest. Yet, it was really when I joined the Developer DAO earlier in March 2022 that things started to pull me down the rabbit hole and I became hooked to web3.\\n\\nNow I work for this project called\\nAnkr, where we are building a decentralized multichain web3 infrastructure and dev tools for developers and enterprises to experience the potential of blockchain without doing any heavy lifting themselves.\\n\\n### Tell us about Developer DAO \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem does D_D solve?\\n\\nKrinza: Developer DAO is a tokenized community of web3 builders and developers. We\u2019re all about creating public goods, offering educational opportunities, and helping developers level up their careers.\\n\\n<blockquote><i>One of the main problems that Developer DAO solves is the lack of resources and support for new web3 developers to explore and build in this space. DevDAO has been a soft ground for most of us in kickstarting our careers in web3.</i></blockquote>\\n\\n### What\u2019s your 2023 plan for D_D?\\n\\nKrinza: 2023 plan for Developer DAO is to keep on contributing to the organization\u2019s growth and development while ensuring we engage with members outside of the community and give them a platform to learn and grow with us. This will happen through a couple of initiatives we are launching this quarter that will get builders to attend their first hackathons (Build Scholarships), get the right kind of resources and mentorship (DevRel Incubation), and eventually full-time jobs in web3 (DevDao Jobs).\\n\\n### How is D_D using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\nKrinza: We have recently plugged Push Protocol to add another layer of notification, and we\u2019re super excited to see all the awesome ways we can use it. Right now, we\u2019re thinking about sending notifications for things like new proposals on Snapshot and new topic creations on our forum. But we can also think about reminder pings for when proposal voting is about to end and notifications for our newsletter and new blog posts on DevDAO Hashnode. The possibilities are endless, and we can\u2019t wait to see what we come up with!\\n\\n### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\nKrinza: The experience with Push has been smooth, which has allowed us to make the community members informed of the on-chain activities. It is easy to integrate and offers many benefits to bring the community together in a much more secure manner.\\n\\nSpecial shout-out to Harsh, Fabio, and Jun for always being available to engage with the DevDAO community.\\n\\n### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\nKrinza: Supporting more chains, and eventually onboarding more ecosystems!\\n\\n### What do you usually do (for fun) besides web3? :)\\n\\nKrinza: Ah \u2014 lots of random things. I\u2019ve recently started to skip rope and of course more traveling.\\n\\nThank you so much Krinza. You\u2019re truly awesome! We can\u2019t wait to see how this journey goes for D_D and Push.\\n\\nAbout Developer DAO\\nDevDAO is a community of web3 builders working towards creating a better internet.

As our ambitions grew beyond just notifications, we felt we needed a brand refresh that would better accommodate our vision of becoming web3\u2019s most widely used communication protocol.\\n\\nAnd so far, people seem to love it.\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\", aspectRatio: \'56.25%\' }} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiC-nbg9Iuk\\" title=\\"EPNS Rebrands into Push Protocol \u2014 the Communication Protocol for Web3\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\nA fantastic rebrand however needs similarly fantastic project developments behind it. This started included:\\n\\n- Push going live on [Ethereum](https://medium.com/push-protocol/the-epns-mainnet-is-here-470faec0c01) mainnet in January.\\n- Completed our Series A round and honored to have some amazing [investors](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1514632659514798081) help us realize our vision.\\n- Many exciting product developments followed including the launch of the [SNS](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-sns-for-push-delivery-nodes-quickest-way-to-bootstrap-your-wallet-app-or-any-c88017595e09) module for Push Delivery Nodes and the release of [SDK monorepo](https://medium.com/push-protocol/here-comes-the-all-new-epns-sdk-monorepo-framework-8447b486a801) structure. Both these developments were aimed at creating a seamless experience for developers.\\n- We launched on [Polygon](https://blockworks.co/news/polygon-onboards-new-web3-native-communication-network), adding it to our expanding list of supported chains.\\n- Our most awaited product, [Push Chat](https://medium.com/push-protocol/were-still-pushing-a-deeper-look-into-push-chat-90fdea8d9e8e) went live in alpha and with it, we took a huge step in facilitating wallet-to-wallet communication in web3.\\n\\nSince going live with all these features, we\u2019ve seen increased adoption and utility of the Push protocol.\\n\\n## Push by the Numbers\ud83d\udcc8\\n\\n2022 saw more notifications, live channels, and channel subscribers than we\u2019ve ever had before.\\n\\nAs we\u2019ve continued to refine, improve, and develop our communication tools, more protocols are harnessing the power of notifications than ever before \u2014 and we\u2019re happy to be leading the way. In fact, in Q1 and Q3 Push saw more than 20%+ QoQ growth.\\n\\nWe went [live on Polygon in September](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-protocol-launches-on-polygon-enabling-communication-for-thousands-of-dapps-1c49d7c996f8) and [live on Lens in October](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-and-lens-powering-ux-with-notifications-and-aaves-lens-85828638e691), giving Push a huge boost in the way of reach and utility.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a look at the numbers:\\n\\n![Push Growth](./image-1.png)\\n<ImageText>Push Growth Overview</ImageText>\\n\\n![Notifications](./image-2.png)\\n<ImageText>Number of Push Notifications \u2014 Powered by </ImageText>\\n\\n## The Push Fam Continues to Expand \ud83c\udf31\\n\\n2022 was a fantastic year for making new frens and building new partnerships.

To all the devs who built using Push, all $PUSH token holders, and users who subscribe to channels \u2014 we thank you for being a part of our community!\\n\\nTo foster our community\u2019s growth, we started the [Push Grants Program](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-grants-program-its-here-f2bfba29388f) earlier this year with the goal of funding builders in the web3 space. With feedback and learnings from the first iteration of the program, [PGP v2.0](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1604867953190739973) went live later this year and we\u2019ve seen tons of projects begin to apply.\\n\\n![PGP V2](./image-9.webp)\\n\\nBeyond just community growth, we also wanted to better involve the community in the improvement of Push. To streamline feature requests, we launched [Push Improvement Proposal](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-push-improvement-proposal-pip-702c44fc24f6) to create an open forum to discuss proposals for standardized, community-driven improvements in the Push ecosystem.\\n\\n![PIP](./image-10.webp)\\n\\nPush now has new initiatives for fostering Push notifications and chat integration, community-led improvements to the protocol, and community growth.\\n\\nWe have no doubt setting these initiatives up in 2022 is going to lead to a massive year for us in 2023!\\n\\n## You\u2019re the Real Rockstars\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfa4\\n\\nWe launched the second version of Push Rockstars this year: Rockstars Of Push Vol. 2 and had 24 winners to date, 100+ submissions, and over 20M+ of $PUSH token voting!\\n\\nFrom educational threads to YouTube demos, the Push community never failed to surprise us with fantastic Push-related content.\\n\\nThanks to all the Rockstars of Push for your love and ongoing support.\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next for Us?\ud83d\ude80\\n\\nAs always, we continue to build.\\n\\nEverything we\u2019ve done this year has been a stepping stone to prepare us for a massive 2023. We\u2019ll be looking to set new records for Push integrations, utility, and partnerships, all while bringing exciting new developments that best serve the communication needs of web3.\\n\\nHappy Holidays from the Push team, and we look forward to building with you in 2023.\\n\\n![Offsite](./image-11.jpg)"},{"id":"push-helps-mover-the-first-crypto-debit-card-to-power-communication-on-the-platform","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-helps-mover-the-first-crypto-debit-card-to-power-communication-on-the-platform","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-22-mover-push/index.md","title":"Push Helps Mover \u2014 the First Crypto Debit Card, to Power Communication on the Platform","description":"Cover image of Push Helps Mover \u2014 the First Crypto Debit Card, to Power Communication on the Platform","date":"2022-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 22, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Frensofpush","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/frensofpush"},{"label":"Push Notification","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-notification"},{"label":"Push Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-protocol"},{"label":"Defi","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/defi"},{"label":"Debitcard","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/debitcard"}],"readingTime":2.5966666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-helps-mover-the-first-crypto-debit-card-to-power-communication-on-the-platform","title":"Push Helps Mover \u2014 the First Crypto Debit Card, to Power Communication on the Platform","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"In the fifth episode of \u201cFrens of Push,\u201d we are in conversation with Anton Mozgovoy, CEO and Co-Founder of Mover, to talk about how Push is fostering decentralized communication on the platform.","tags":["Web3","Frensofpush","Push Notification","Push Protocol","Defi","Debitcard"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Push 2022 Year in Review\ud83c\udf89","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-2022-year-in-review"},"nextItem":{"title":"We\u2019re Still Pushing: A Deeper Look Into Push Chat","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/were-still-pushing-a-deeper-look-into-push-chat"}},"content":"![Cover image of Push Helps Mover \u2014 the First Crypto Debit Card, to Power Communication on the Platform](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\x3c!--customheaderpoint--\x3e\\n\\n# Frens of Push #5<br/>\\n\\n<i><a href=\\"https://medium.com/push-protocol/tagged/frensofpush\\">\u201cFrens of Push\u201d</a> is our weekly content series to spotlight outstanding projects that are building with Push.

What are you working on now?\\n\\n<b>Anton:</b> I\u2019ve been in the space since 2016, and I think that everyone would agree that there are human years, and there are crypto years. Down the rabbit hole, time feels different. I love this space, and I live it. What do I do here? I\u2019m a builder. I love experimenting, I love building the tech. My passion is building simple products that solve complex problems. Mover is just that.\\n\\n## Tell us about Mover \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem do you guys solve?\\n\\n<b>Anton:</b> <a href=\\"https://viamover.com/\\">Mover</a> is a web3 primitives platform. We created the first crypto debit card that supports web3 primitives. What\u2019s that? Well, Push Protocol is a primitive. It is a communication layer primitive. Lending, savings, options, derivatives, NFTs \u2014 all of them are primitives. So in other words, <b>Mover allows you to use your favorite crypto network or protocol in your day-to-day finance</b>.\\n\\n## What is Mover\u2019s plan for 2023?\\n\\n<b>Anton:</b> A new card, more networks, more primitives, and instant cash out! That is to name a few upcoming things.\\n\\n<blockquote><i>Our goal is very simple, we want to offer one debit card for all web3. One card for all crypto natives: those who contribute to a DAO, those who trade on DEXs, those who trade decentralized options, those who collect NFTs, those who mint NFTs, those who create NFTs, and many more. We are here to create THE web3 card.</i></blockquote>\\n\\n## How is Mover using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\n<b>Anton:</b> Currently, there are over 786 notifications sent to subscribers on our vault contracts. The notifications help users get real-time updates on when they receive their yield.\\n\\nYou can opt-in to the Mover channel here:\\n\\n[Push App (Previously EPNS)](https://app.push.org/?source=post_page-----d1c05c90f736--------------------------------#/channels?channel=0xb754601d2C8C1389E6633b1449B84CcE57788566)\\n\\n## How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\n<b>Anton:</b> We have been a customer and user of Push since the very beginning! Our mission has always been to push the boundaries of decentralized and permissionless system, while making everyday finance easier. <b>Push Protocol is an important part of making our mission easier.</b> Our experience has always been smooth. Only in web3 you can meet up and say \u201chow about this?\u201d and the other protocol is \u201csounds good, let\u2019s push it\u201d, and later that day it\u2019s already running on-chain.<br/><br/>\\n\\nMover is built by engineers and active web3 users.

If you want to skip the line and become one of the first builders to try out Push Chat \u2014 keep reading \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n## What Is Push Chat?\\n\\n[Push Chat](https://app.push.org/#/chat) is a secure messaging protocol built by Push Protocol. Messages are encrypted, signed, and stored on IPFS and they are sent through Push Nodes.\\n\\n<i>Note: The team is continuing to develop the Push Protocol including notification and chat for wallets regardless of any chain in web3 in a multichain, platform-agnostic, and gasless way. Push Chat is the next offering of the protocol after push notifications and is currently available on Ethereum and Polygon with other chain support to follow soon.</i>\\n\\n## Why Push Chat now?\\n\\nPush Chat and video were imagined by us in 2020 but we knew that before notifications become a reality, doing chat or video will just become a novelty as everything we do in our virtual lives starts out with a notification.\\n\\nFor example, you don\u2019t chat on WhatsApp as much as you chat via notifications on WhatsApp, the same is the case with Facetime. Owing to this, Push created notifications for web3 first which paved the way for real-time communication mediums to become a possibility.\\n\\nPush Protocol\u2019s vision has remained to be the de-facto layer of communication for the entire web3 and Push Chat (with native push notification support) helps in wrapping another milestone to bring the UX of web3 on par with web2.\\n\\n## How Push Chat works?\\n\\nPush Chat uses IPFS, encryption, and pinning of the messages on Push Nodes to enable a seamless, no-message drop experience for the user. Each message (and notification) carries a verification proof which the front-end can use to determine that the message content and sender are actually the ones that sent these messages out. You can read about notification verification proofs and the various supported formats here:\\n\\n[PIPs/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification at main \xb7 ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs](https://github.com/push-protocol/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification?source=post_page-----90fdea8d9e8e--------------------------------)\\n\\n## What are Push Nodes?\\n\\n<i><b>Push Nodes</b></i> are a network of nodes, where each node can have a different role in the network that is responsible for validating and dispatching each notification and chat message between addresses.\\n\\nTheir main task is to validate that:\\n\\n- the payload is following the corresponding payload standard,\\n- the sender can actually send the message, and signature validation,\\n- if the payload is valid, the Push Nodes will store the message on IPFS and then send a notification to the receiver of the message.\\n  <i>Note: Push Nodes are in alpha right now and are currently run by the Push Chain team with an alpha version of these nodes scheduled to come out around Q1 / Q2 of 2023.</i>\\n\\n## Who is currently running Push Nodes?\\n\\nThe Push team currently runs the Push Nodes for Push Chat. The team is working towards decentralizing the network every day by making progress in establishing the underlying primitives for the Push Protocol. This is only until the team fully bootstraps the Push Protocol and the protocol and Push Chat are production ready.\\n\\nOnce the network becomes fully decentralized, Push Nodes will be incentivized to maintain the network, be readily addressable, and provide message content through $PUSH tokens which are native tokens of the protocol.\\n\\n<i>Read about Push Economics here:</i><br/><br/>\\n\\n[Push Token Economics](https://comms.push.org/docs/tokenomics/deepdive/$push/)\\n\\n## How Does a User Send a Message Using Their Account Address?\\n\\nA user of Push Chat has two sections: <i><b>Chats and Requests.</b></i>\\n\\nUsers sending a message to another address for the first time will be the first subject to the Request type until the receiving address accepts the message. Then, messages and notifications from that address will appear in the receiving addresses chats section. Eventually, users will be able to block addresses. Receiving addresses aren\u2019t notified about messages in the Request box. This prevents users from receiving messages from any random address that sends them a message and general spam.\\n\\nIf a message is sent to an address that hasn\u2019t been authenticated yet on the Push Protocol, those messages will be in plain text until the receiving address authenticates itself.\\n\\n![Push Chat](./image-1.webp)\\n<ImageText>Push Chat: <a href=\\"https://app.push.org/#/chat\\">https://app.push.org/#/chat</a></ImageText>\\n\\n## Where are messages stored?\\n\\nPush Nodes store all messages sent over the network. Any Push Node can expose locally stored messages to the network, which other Push Nodes can connect to and fetch. The nodes can then push these messages to a user\u2019s public address. Each message is stored on IPFS along with its verification proof which allows the frontends to verify that the content of the message indeed originated from the sender and not from anyone else.\\n\\n## Are messages safe, and is the network secure?\\n\\nPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is an encryption method that provides privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP encryption keys are generated for every address on the network. Learn more about P2P encryption here.\\n\\nThe PGP public key is used to encrypt the content sent using asymmetric encryption. This ensures that the encrypted message payload can only be decrypted by the receiver and no other third party can decrypt or see the content of the message.\\n\\nNote: The encryption method used here is future-proof, as other methods can encrypt the keys and adapt to newer cryptography.\\n\\n## Does this apply to notifications? How do notifications fit into all this?\\n\\nChat while an integral part of any application works best when notifications are integrated into it natively. Most of the time, whenever we are chatting either on Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, or anywhere else, we usually don\u2019t have the application open. Instead, we reply to a message and then go on doing other activities until the other person replies which we receive as a notification.\\n\\nPush Chat uses this exact web2 UX to ensure that the web3 user finally gets the same experience as that of a web2 user by utilizing the native push notifications capabilities of Push Protocol to send a notification out to the wallet address if the wallet address has approved the request of the sender wallet.\\n\\n## Push Working Towards Decentralization\\n\\nApplications need to protect users and their data and remove censorship. The Push team is privileged to tackle a fundamental problem in the new web (such as the poor user experience and a subliminal communication layer).\\n\\nTo achieve decentralization, the Push team has broken that into two phases, one is content can\u2019t be changed and the other one is content can\u2019t be censored.\\n\\n### 1) Content can\u2019t be changed\\n\\nWith verification proof, the immutability of the content is always ensured (1), read more here:\\n\\n[PIPs/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification at main \xb7 ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs](https://github.com/push-protocol/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification?source=post_page-----90fdea8d9e8e--------------------------------)\\n\\n### 2) Content can\u2019t be censored\\n\\nThis is achieved by developing Push Nodes that enables anyone to run the node in a permissionless way with PoS to incentivize and penalize behavior. Alpha Push Nodes are scheduled to happen somewhere between Q1 / Q2 of 2023.\\n\\n## Push-ing Real Solutions for Web3\\n\\nYes, the user experience in web3 needs much work, and to be frank, it is likely years out from where it should be. That is why the Push team is focusing on a protocol that tackles the problem from the ground up, a grassroots solution, and a primary reason why web3 is the next iteration of the web \u2014 improving how we interact.\\n\\nWhen a sufficient number of dapps and services in web3 implement Push chat, it enables a new wave of use cases and scales coordination because now messaging and notifications are web-wide and not in isolation to dapps and their users.\\n\\nDapps can use event-driven computation to communicate off-chain or on-chain with one another and enable fully-scaled coordination. Dapps also don\u2019t have to worry about maintaining the underlying infrastructure to push messages which takes the load off developers, and the network guarantees message integrity.\\n\\n### We mean it \u2014 let\u2019s scale communication\\n\\nWe previously described how you could use Push Protocol for various use cases in web3, such as in [governance](https://medium.com/push-protocol/an-introduction-to-push-notification-part-2-2-governance-use-cases-1ea1e0a58ce1). While Push allows for these great capabilities, the truth is that many web3 governance systems lack participation. Many DAOs depend on a few contributors and have a central source of truth, and there is still a disconnect between DeFi and the user. User coordination generates high-value sources of truth. We can see this with the effectiveness of crowdfunding, the pooling of knowledge, funds, and resources, novel voting methods, petitions, and even zero-knowledge primitives. An easily adaptable communication stack and an ambitious outlook are a step in the right direction.\\n\\nImagine a web-wide poll about a major topic that anyone around the world can participate in. The poll is guaranteed to be censorship-resistant and verifiable, all while properly incentivizing those who participated and curated the poll with their resources. This scratches the surface of the coordination capabilities of a web3-native messaging protocol.\\n\\n### Push your dapp\\n\\nYour application and the users of web3 deserve robust communication. Push Chat can help. Here is a summary of its key features:\\n\\n- <b>Push Chat is permissionless:</b> the production-ready version will allow any address on any platform to use their account (address) to chat with any other account across web3. Users aren\u2019t required to sign up anywhere.\\n- <b>Push Chat is forward-compatible:</b> Push Chat can adapt to any changes made to existing platforms or new ones that arise, as the messaging functionality will not rely on the underlying platform the messages are sent and received from.\\n- <b>Push Chat is user-friendly:</b> Push Chat is a friendly and familiar-facing user experience that current users appreciate.\\n- <b>Push Chat is developer-friendly:</b> Using the Push chat SDK, developers can add a messaging layer to their application or service. The message type is JSON, making it easy for developers to consume and interpret. Developers can integrate push chat into the development workflow and improve their CI/CD processes. Test and deployment results can be pushed as messages to user wallets.\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\nPssssssst \ud83e\udd2b\\n\\nThanks for making it this far.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re interested in exploring how Push Chat can boost user engagement and benefit your project, please:\\n\\n- Share this article\\n- Join our Discord [#push-chat-alpha channel](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol), and tell us what you\u2019re building, we\u2019ve got devs who can help give consultation and we\u2019ll be sharing exclusive Push Chat access to Discord members soon!\\n- To get started building right away, head over to the [Push Chat developer docs](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat).\\n\\nSee you soon on Push Chat!"},{"id":"push-and-tollan-worlds-partner-to-level-up-communication-with-gamers","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-and-tollan-worlds-partner-to-level-up-communication-with-gamers","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-15-tollan-worlds-push/index.md","title":"Push and Tollan Worlds Partner to Level Up Communication With Gamers","description":"Cover image of Push and Tollan Worlds Partner to Level Up Communication With Gamers","date":"2022-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 15, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Frensofpush","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/frensofpush"},{"label":"Push Notification","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-notification"},{"label":"Gaming","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/gaming"},{"label":"Web3 Game","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3-game"},{"label":"Mmorpg","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/mmorpg"}],"readingTime":3.506666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-and-tollan-worlds-partner-to-level-up-communication-with-gamers","title":"Push and Tollan Worlds Partner to Level Up Communication With Gamers","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"In the fourth segment of \u2018Frens of Push,\u2019 we are in conversation with Michael Kuvshynov, co-founder and CEO of Tollan Worlds, to talk about how Push is enabling communication on the gaming platform.","tags":["Frensofpush","Push Notification","Gaming","Web3 Game","Mmorpg"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"We\u2019re Still Pushing: A Deeper Look Into Push Chat","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/were-still-pushing-a-deeper-look-into-push-chat"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing Push Protocol v1.5 \ud83c\udf8a","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/introducing-push-protocol-v1-5"}},"content":"import { ImageText, VideoContainer } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of Push and Tollan Worlds Partner to Level Up Communication With Gamers](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\x3c!--customheaderpoint--\x3e\\n\\n# Frens of Push #4 a little holiday giveaway brought to you by the Tollan Worlds team\\n\\n<i><a href=\\"https://medium.com/push-protocol/tagged/frensofpush\\">\u201cFrens of Push\u201d</a> is our weekly content series to spotlight outstanding projects that are building with Push.

What are you working on now?\\n\\n<b>Michael:</b> My blockchain journey started a few years ago. Coming from computer science and game design backgrounds as well as creating various content as a hobby, I saw the tremendous potential Web3 can bring to each of these directions. Kernel from Gitcoin has been my gateway into the decentralized world and taught me a lot about the values of the new web, most importantly about the sense of community and the power of decentralization on an ethical level. I believe whoever wants to start building in Web3 should stop asking what Web3 could do for them and instead ask what they could do for Web3.<br/><br/>\\n\\n<blockquote>Gaming was always my passion, and I\u2019ve seen it as one of the biggest use cases for blockchain and especially NFT technologies.

Here\u2019s what to expect from the update.<br/>\\n\\nPush Protocol is elated to announce the successful completion of the [security audit of our smart contracts v1.5](https://github.com/ChainSafe/audits/blob/main/EPNS/epns-protocol-11-2022.pdf) with Chainsafe.\\n\\nThe completion of this audit was one of the most significant roadmap items for this year. We couldn\u2019t be happier to share with you all that our version 1.5 of Core and Communicator smart contracts have been successfully audited by Chainsafe.\\n\\nOur [initial plan](https://medium.com/push-protocol/epns-contract-v2-features-e7887fac72a6) was to release Push v2 all at once in 2022. However, we decided to split up the upgrade into v1.5 and v2 in order to ensure adequate time for development, testing, and auditing. The decision allowed us to drive forward with this launch of v1.5 while continuing to build v2\\n\\nVersion 1.5 of Push smart contracts includes imperative functionalities that will provide better features to users and also improve the overall utility of the PUSH token. Below, we recap six of the most critical new functionalities of the Push Core and Communicator smart contracts in v1.5.\\n\\nLet\u2019s dive in!\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n## 1) Enhancing the PUSH token utility through channel creation\\n\\nOne of the most significant modifications in v1.5 of the Push smart contract can be found in the channel creation procedure. In v1 of the core contract design, channel creators were required to deposit DAI to launch a channel. In v1.5, the protocol removes the need to deposit DAI. <b>Instead, all channels will now be created using PUSH</b>.\\n\\nAdditionally, v1.5 of Push smart contracts will also deprecate the use of AAVE, which was previously used to deposit DAI tokens and earn interests.\\n\\nAll crucial transactions of core smart contracts like <i>channel creations, channel reactivation or deactivation, and channel details modifications</i> will require PUSH with the launch of v1.5.\\n\\n## 2) Incentivizing the network with the PUSH Protocol Fee Pool\\n\\nVersion 1.5 of Push smart contracts will introduce the concept of <b>Protocol Fee Pool</b>. So, what exactly is a Protocol Fee Pool?\\n\\nThe protocol fee is a small fee amount deducted by the core smart contract for any imperative transaction like channel creation, channel reactivation, channel detail modification, and others.\\n\\nAs of now, the protocol fee is set to be equal to <b>10 PUSH tokens</b>. This value, however, can be changed by the community later using on-chain governance.\\n\\n<b>Note for Channel Creators:</b>\\n\\nIt must be noted that this is not an additional fee that is charged on top of channel creation fees. Instead, the protocol fee is simply deducted from the same amount that a channel creator chooses to stake in the protocol. For example, if you chose to stake 50 PUSH during channel creation, 10 of those 50 PUSH tokens go into Protocol Fee Pool, while the remaining goes into Channel Pool Funds that are claimable by channel owners anytime they choose to deactivate their channel.\\n\\nThe Protocol Fee Pool is going to play an imperative role in the incentivization mechanism of the core smart contracts, which will allow PUSH holders and users of the protocol to also earn incentives from the protocol in the form of PUSH.\\n\\nSince the incentives will be directly tied to the protocol\u2019s fee pool, this would mean that the more the protocol expands its boundaries, the better the incentives for users that they can claim from the contracts.\\n\\n## 3) Enabling more flexibility and customization with time-bound channels\\n\\nWith this new version of smart contracts, v1.5 will introduce another amazing feature that allows users to create time-bound channels.<b>Time-bound channels</b> are the ones that can be created for a specific duration of time and can easily be removed once the duration is over.\\n\\nDiving a bit deeper into this function: while the underlying channel creation procedure is similar, this feature allows users to pass an additional parameter \u2014 the date of expiry of the channel \u2014 to the already existing channel creation function. This is what indicates that a time-bound channel with a predefined expiration date is to be created. Once the channel\u2019s duration is over, the channel creator can destroy the channel and get the staked tokens back.\\n\\nFinally, the original creator can recreate the channel using the same address after destroying the previous time-bound channel. This was not possible till now with permanent channels.\\n\\n## 4) Allowing for upgrades and adjustments with channel edit features\\n\\nV1.5 brings with it a much-awaited feature: the ability to modify your channel details! Descriptions, logo, information, etc.\\n\\nWhile editing channels is a simple feature, there were a specific set of reasons why this wasn\u2019t made available until v1.5.\\n\\nIdeally, modifying channel details repeatedly is not a behaviour that is encouraged. Editing and modifying channel details could allow a malicious channel owner to update details and confuse subscribers, impersonating important DeFi or governance channels, for example.\\n\\nHowever, since this feature was an important one for the community and users, we included this feature in v1.5 of the smart contracts along with the crucial steps to avoid the above-mentioned scenario.\\n\\n<b>\ud83d\udcb0 Channel Edit Fees \ud83d\udcb0:</b>\\n\\nEditing channel details requires fees to be deposited. This fee shall keep increasing if the channel owner repeatedly updates their channel name, logo, description, etc.\\n\\n<b>\u26a0\ufe0f Warning Sign \u26a0\ufe0f:</b>\\n\\nWhenever a channel owner modifies any specific detail about their channel on the protocol, the channel shall appear with an additional note/warning in the dApp UI. This note will inform the rest of the users as well as subscribers about the channel\u2019s old name or description.\\n\\n## 5) Enabling notifications using The Graph subgraph\\n\\nPush has developed an in-house helper function specifically for The Graph protocol that allows you to read events from the subgraph and define notifications accordingly. Once defined, they will be stored on the Subgraph in a \u201clong string\u201d format.\\n\\nThis function shall simply allow users to pass subGraph data, in the form of bytes, which is basically a combination of the Subgraph ID and Poll Interval. It emits out the event with the msg.sender and the bytes value.\\n\\nThe function shall only be accessible by the activated channels in the protocol.\\n\\n## 6) Including of EIP-1271 in the Push Communicator contract\\n\\nAlright, now that we have talked about quite a few new features in the Push Core smart contracts, it\u2019s time to discuss the Push Communicator smart contract.\\n\\nAlthough the communicator contract doesn\u2019t have a lot of new features in this version, it has one major feature worth discussing. The v1.5 of Push Communicator smart contract implements <b>EIP-1271</b>.\\n\\n<b>What is EIP-1271?</b>\\n\\nIn very simpler terms, EIP 1271 provides a standard to verify signatures that come from the account which is a smart contract address instead of an EOA address.\\n\\nWhile externally-owned accounts (EOA) can easily sign messages with their associated private keys, smart contracts can\u2019t do the same (since they don\u2019t have any private keys). However, with the help of the EIP-1271 standard, we have an effective mechanism by which a contract can indicate whether a given signature is valid or not on its behalf. Read more about EIP-1271 [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271).\\n\\nSome of the crucial features of the Push Protocol communicator contract are now carried out off-chain. For example, opting in or opting out of a channel or sending notifications are now fairly easy procedures as all you need to do is sign a message using your EOA.\\n\\nHowever, now with EIP-1271 implementation in the communicator contract, it shall be fairly simple for wallets like Argent wallet, multi-sigs like Gnosis safe, or smart contracts to validate signatures on their behalf and use these features as well.\\n\\n<b>Preparing for the future with Push v1.5</b>\\n\\nA lot of development has gone into reaching this moment with Push v1.5. We\u2019re thrilled by all the support from the community. V1.5 is one of the most important upgrades the protocol has undergone. Updates to channel creation and fees create more nuanced utility for the PUSH token and ecosystem. Time-bound and editable channels deliver much-requested customization to users. The integration with The Graph and EIP-1271 demonstrate Push\u2019s commitment to best-in-class technology standards and partners. We\u2019re thrilled for the Push community to welcome v1.5 soon, while we continue to build out Push v2 and deliver that to the community in the near future!\\n\\n<b>Note:</b>\\n\\nThe Push Core and Communicator smart contracts will be upgraded to version 1.5 by January 2023. All the above-mentioned modifications and new features will come into effect post the upgrade."},{"id":"developer-dao-x-push-enhancing-ux-through-web3-communication-tools","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/developer-dao-x-push-enhancing-ux-through-web3-communication-tools","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-08-developer-dao-push/index.md","title":"Developer DAO x Push \u2014 Enhancing UX Through Web3 Communication Tools","description":"Cover image of Developer DAO x Push \u2014 Enhancing UX Through Web3 Communication Tools","date":"2022-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 8, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Push Notification","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-notification"},{"label":"Giveaway","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/giveaway"},{"label":"Workshop","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/workshop"},{"label":"Developer","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/developer"}],"readingTime":1.9733333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"developer-dao-x-push-enhancing-ux-through-web3-communication-tools","title":"Developer DAO x Push \u2014 Enhancing UX Through Web3 Communication Tools","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We are excited to have Developer DAO as a part of the Push ecosystem and look forward to enhancing the community experience via decentralized communication.

With over 5000 members from around the world, D_D continues to accelerate its mission of empowering a new wave of Web3 builders through constant innovations and educational efforts.\\n\\nWe are excited to have Developer DAO as a part of the Push ecosystem and look forward to enhancing the community experience via decentralized communication. This is only the start of an amazing journey with D_D!\\n\\n## Developer DAO X Push: What to expect\\n\\nFacilitating a culture of \u201clearning and growing together\u201d is a cornerstone mission of D_D. With this in mind, the importance of streamlined community participation and governance is critical to the community\u2019s success. This is where Push comes in.\\n\\nPush Protocol addresses this user experience problem by providing a communication layer for wallets and dapps. Push allows any dapp, smart contract, backend, protocol, or, in principle, any distributed technology to send communication directly to user wallet addresses in an open and decentralized way. Being an open and permissionless protocol, anyone can create dedicated channels to distribute information directly to user wallets without needing to rely on centralized service providers.\\n\\n### Push x D_D channel soon!\\n\\nBy creating a communication channel for D_D members, Push aims to encourage maximum participation by DAO members. Push will notify:\\n\\n- When there is a new proposal on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth)\\n- 24 hrs before the proposal voting ends\\n- When there is a new Proposal topic created on the [D_D forum](https://forum.developerdao.com/c/proposals/5)\\n- When a Substack newsletter or blog post is live\\n\\nD_D official channel will be live on [Push](https://app.push.org/) on Dec 13th. Members can simply opt-in and stay up-to-date with all the latest updates from Developer DAO.\\n\\nKeep an eye out for all the surprises and exclusive events we have for the D_D community.\\n\\n### Push workshop: Power your Web3 app with Push\\n\\nWe\u2019re pulling together an awesome <b>1-hour workshop</b> for the D_D community with our founder [Harsh](https://twitter.com/harshrajat) and core dev [Fabio](https://twitter.com/learn4life6).\\n\\nWhether you are just entering the space, an experienced developer, or an indie hacker, we will help you understand our tech and learn how to use Push Protocol to power your web3 app through a hands-on workshop.

If you want to be featured, reach out to us and you could be our next Fren in the series.</i><br/><br/>\\n\\n<a href=\\"https://indexcoop.com/\\"><b>Index Coop</b></a>, the leading on-chain index products provider, has integrated Push to enable a seamless communication channel with its community.\\n\\nThe adoption of DeFi has come a long way in the past few years and led to an influx of people who want uninterrupted access to digital assets. Index Coop is working to improve access to these digital assets via index products that democratize the way web3 users access complex crypto strategies. Index Coop works towards this mission by operating as a cooperative community of crypto natives, finance professionals, engineers, and other expert methodologists.\\n\\nBy collaborating with Push, Index Coop has created a direct communication channel to notify their community about important product announcements and updates.\\n\\nIn the third episode of \u201cFrens of Push\u201d, we sat down with [Brad Morris](https://twitter.com/bradwmorris) to talk about the possibilities created by on-chain communication with token holders.\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n## Tell us about Indexcoop \u2014 what problem does Index Coop solve?\\n\\n<b>Brad:</b> Accessing DeFi is difficult. At the Coop, we tokenize sophisticated DeFi strategies while maintaining decentralization and empowering individuals to enter the world of DeFi. Traditionally, we might be recognized as a provider of Index products, enabling diversification across multiple crypto assets.\\n\\n<a href=\\"https://indexcoop.com/blog/index-coop-the-next-chapter?source=post_page-----a72fc7be86e8--------------------------------\\"><b>Meet Our Upcoming Products</b></a>\\n\\n## How do people use Index Coop?\\n\\n<b>Brad:</b> Pending compliance with all local jurisdictions and regulations, people can access Index Coop products directly through popular dApps and exchanges like Uniswap and Sushi. We\u2019re also listed through Coinbase and the amazing Argent wallet.\\n\\nOr directly through our own website app: https://app.indexcoop.com/\\n\\nIf anyone has more questions, they can jump into our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/indexcoop) and meet with our community and community managers.\\n\\n## What\u2019s your future plan for Index Coop?\\n\\n<b>Brad:</b> Directly from: https://indexcoop.com/blog/index-coop-the-next-chapter\\n\\nSince launching over two years ago, the Index Coop has established itself as the leader in on-chain structured products. With over 80% of the market share of on-chain index products, we\u2019ve experienced first-hand the many trends and cycles of DeFi. <b>During this period, our thesis has remained the same: on-chain products are the future and it\u2019s up to us to make sure it includes everyone</b>. To that end, we\u2019ve remained committed to building products that are accessible, secure, and simple to use.\\n\\nAs this industry has grown, the definitions of \u201csimple\u201d and \u201csecure\u201d have become ambiguous. Is DeFi simple when it takes ten steps to complete a transaction or must be monitored daily? Is it secure when promised yields disappear or when pegs falter? The next wave of DeFi will not look like the days of old. Traditional retail buyers and institutional capital will not behave like the degens of the past. Crypto must be held to a higher standard in order to onboard the next wave of users. Veteran DeFi users and traditional buyers alike expect performance. So, we must build for both performances and for sustainability.\\n\\nThe question then becomes: how does our industry deliver on the advancements and efficiencies of the on-chain world while still being simple and safe enough for the average user? Index Coop bridges this gap, allowing anyone to access sophisticated strategies. Our upcoming roadmap of products and enhancements captures the best advantages of DeFi while being secure and easy to use.\\n\\n## How is Index Coop using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\n<b>Brad:</b> We plan to leverage the Push communication layer to provide a more seamless communication channel with our community and customer base.\\n\\nFirst, by providing high-level insights, notifications, and updates to our customers on the community on major product and new product updates.\\n\\nWe then intend to evolve our use of Push to provide more nuanced communication to our audience around specific product updates, rebalancing, etc.\\n\\n## How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\n<b>Brad:</b> We\u2019re only new to the Push ecosystem! But we\u2019ve already received positive feedback from customers who are grateful for the exploration of additional on-chain communication channels.\\n\\n## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\n<b>Brad:</b> Endless! <b>We see these on-chain, wallet-integrated communication channels as playing a huge role in the future of DeFi</b>. For an organization like ours, aggressively product-focused and always looking for ways to innovate and create infrastructure to improve DeFi access for a wider audience, on-chain communication and notifications will be extremely important and helpful.\\n\\n## What haven\u2019t we asked you about that you wish we had?\\n\\n<b>Brad:</b> I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll catch up again soon with some additional updates!\\n\\nWe want to thank [Brad](https://twitter.com/bradwmorris) for speaking with us! We look forward to building with Index and cultivating better communication with their awesome coop.

Many of these projects are expanding rapidly and looking to hire new talent. This is where Cryptocurrency Jobs enters the picture. By connecting Web3 professionals with leading blockchain-based companies from around the world, Cryptocurrency Jobs is helping bridge the hiring gap in Web3.\\n\\nThrough the collaboration with Push, the platform is bringing new job opportunities and updates to Web3 professionals directly. All this is made possible through decentralized Push notifications that users can opt-in to receive on their devices.\\n\\nIn the second episode of \u201cFrens of Push\u201d, we are in conversation with Daniel \u2014 the founder of Cryptocurrency Jobs, to talk about how Push is enabling a people-centric approach to hiring.\\n\\n## How did you become involved in building the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\\n\\n<b>Daniel:</b> Hi, I\u2019m Daniel, the founder of Cryptocurrency Jobs. I began my journey in this space through the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies course on Coursera. Fun fact: it\u2019s taught by the founders of Arbitrum. Falling down the rabbit hole, I wanted to get involved and contribute to the community so I launched Cryptocurrency Jobs in October 2017. <b>Since then, I\u2019ve featured over 10,000 jobs at 1,000+ companies and startups and published 406 newsletter issues</b>. All for free and accessible to all. Since then Cryptocurrency Jobs has become the leading job board for blockchain and cryptocurrency jobs \u2014 entirely independent, bootstrapped, and run by me.\\n\\n## What\u2019s your future plan for Cryptocurrency Jobs?\\n\\n<b>Daniel:</b> Cryptocurrency Jobs recently <a href=\\"https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/blog/five-years-of-cryptocurrency-jobs-and-a-new-partnership/\\">turned five</a>. As part of the milestone, I announced the newest partner to Cryptocurrency Jobs: Pantera Capital. Since 2013, Pantera Capital has invested in digital assets and blockchain companies. I\u2019m excited to work with the team, support their portfolio companies, and help you find more opportunities to grow in this space. As I continue to build Cryptocurrency Jobs, I remain committed to making this a friendly place for people everywhere. That\u2019s why all content will remain open and accessible to all. There will be no gatekeeping. Everyone is welcome, and you all have a place in crypto.\\n\\n## How is Cryptocurrency Jobs using Push\u2019s Web3 communication layer?\\n\\n<b>Daniel:</b> Since 2021, I have been working with Push Protocol to help them find talented humans for their team. I recently started using Push\u2019s Web3 communication layer to create a decentralized communication channel that allows direct interaction with the Cryptocurrency Jobs community. The <a href=\\"https://medium.com/push-protocol/app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xde3e447E125FA2391DC9BCbfA0B821424422FEAF\\">Cryptocurrency Jobs channel</a> is live on the Push Protocol platform, and you can subscribe to receive decentralized notifications about new job opportunities, the weekly newsletter, and more.\\n\\n## How would you describe your experience using Push Protocol? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\n<b>Daniel:</b> The onboarding and setup process has been seamless. The Push Protocol team are true rock stars. Special shout-out to Jaf and Muktanshu for their help guiding me through the process.<br/><br/>\\n\\n<blockquote>Using Push Protocol has opened up a new communication channel with my community and helped onboard new users to the crypto space.</blockquote><br/>\\n\\nWe want to thank Daniel for taking the time to speak with us!

In this series, we highlight outstanding projects who are building using Push and give them the spotlight. If you\u2019re interested in being featured, reach out to us!</i><br/><br/>\\n\\nEarnifi, an airdrop aggregator platform designed to find unclaimed airdrops, has integrated Push to make airdrops more accessible to everyone!\\n\\nEver since the advent of DeFi, airdrops have become a popular marketing tool for protocols to incentivize early users. What started as a way to generate awareness about DeFi projects quickly resulted in providing momentum to the overall adoption of DeFi. The space, however, is now flooded with thousands of projects, leading to missed opportunities for claiming these airdrops. This is where Earnifi comes in.\\n\\nBy aggregating all available airdrops and bringing them to a single platform, Earnifi ensures you never miss out on an airdrop again.\\n\\nIn the first segment of \u201cFrens of Push,\u201d we sat down with Earnifi founder <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/DawsonBotsford\\"><b>Dawson Botsford</b></a> to talk about how Push is furthering Earnifi\u2019s \u201cmission to find millions.\u201d\\n\\n## How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\\n\\n<b>Dawson:</b> I first got into Bitcoin back in 2014, trying to make arbitrage bots. I quickly learned that finance was not enough for me and that smart contracts were the long-term answer to decentralized finance. After working in web2 for the next 5 years, I returned to Ethereum and got obsessed with web 2.5 applications during DeFi Summer.\\n\\nNowadays I run Earnifi, The Airdrop Platform. Earnifi has notified over $1 billion USD since it began in February 2021. Since I\u2019m an indie hacker, I run this alone without other employees.\\n\\nIn addition to my work as the CEO of Earnifi I also hack in TONS of [ETHGlobal](https://medium.com/u/3d1733b8e86a?source=post_page-----9ee5805730f9--------------------------------) hackathons, run the developer podcast [dev3.fm](https://reflect.fm/anchor/dev-3), and publish open-source projects. I am most proud of Essential Eth, a replacement for Ethers.js that is 20x smaller.\\n\\n## How is Earnifi using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\n<b>Dawson:</b> Earnifi uses Push daily as a part of the notification engine. Some people want email notifications, but others want mobile notifications, which is where Push comes in. <b>Earnifi has pushed over 100,000 messages via Push!</b>\\n\\n## How to use Earnifi?\\n\\n<b>Dawson:</b> If you arrive at Earnifi you can easily paste in any Ethereum or Cosmos address. Earnifi will quickly search you for 2,000 different assets, all within just a few seconds. Many of these assets are worth hundreds of dollars and are airdropped to you because you\u2019re an early adopter. Even Push had a big airdrop when they first launched!\\n\\n## How would you describe your experience using Push Protocol? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\n<b>Dawson:</b> Push has been a blast to work with because it enables decentralized notifications. With just a few lines of JavaScript, I\u2019m sending out hundreds of thousands of notifications without ever needing to store information about users.\\n\\n## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\nDawson: Push enables decentralized communication, so seeing the recent announcement of [Push Chat](https://app.push.org/#/chat) gets me super excited! Allowing more decentralized communication means that we can be better informed without needing to trust centralized parties.\\n\\n## What haven\u2019t we asked you about that you wish we had? How is Earnifi giving back?\\n\\n<b>Dawson:</b> One thing Earnifi focuses heavily on is contributing to open-source code. You can see on <a href=\\"https://earni.fi/oss\\">https://earni.fi/oss</a> that Earnifi supports not just revoke.cash but many other projects to bring safety and speed to web3. The world deserves a fast web3, which is why there are several open-source projects Earnifi supports and grows through both code contributions and grants.<br/><br/>\\n\\nOnce again, we thank Dawson for taking the time to speak with us! We look forward to growing alongside Earnifi and helping your protocol deliver meaningful value to the Web3 community.\\n\\nStay tuned for more exciting developments from both Push and Earnifi!\\n\\nIf you\u2019re looking to be featured by Push in one of our upcoming Frens of Push series, reach out to us and let us know!\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n### About Earnifi\\n\\nEarnifi is a solution for discovering and receiving notifications for unclaimed airdrops \u2014 this includes tokens, NFTs, and other claimable assets.

But, to service such a large ecosystem, there needs to be a streamlined process for improving and developing the ecosystem to meet every actor\u2019s needs. Introducing \u2014 Push Improvement Proposals (PIP).\\n\\nPIP is a new standard for proposing improvements, specs, and standards to the Push ecosystem. The goal of PIPs is to provide a standardized, community-driven improvements, specs, and standards for improving the Push ecosystem. In this way, PIPs is going to become an integral part of how the Push ecosystem grows and evolves to best serve the needs of its users.\\n\\nCurious to know more about what PIPs are, how they\u2019re processed, and why they matter? Read on to find out.\\n\\n## What is a PIP?\\n\\nPIP stands for Push Improvement Proposal. It is a standardized process that enables developers and community members alike to collaborate and make changes to the Push ecosystem. Inspired by the [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1) (Ethereum Improvement Proposal), PIP is a step towards broadening the scope of community participation in innovating the Push ecosystem.\\n\\nThere are three types of PIPs:\\n\\n1. <b>Standard</b> PIP describes any change that affects most or all Push ecosystem implementations, such as changes in core, interface, networking, or application level standards.\\n2. <b>Meta</b> PIP describes a process surrounding Push or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process PIPs are like Standards Track PIPs but apply to areas other than the Push protocol itself. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Push development. Any <b>meta-PIP</b> is also considered a Process PIP.\\n3. <b>Informational</b> PIP provides general guidelines or information to the Push community but does not propose a new feature. Informational PIPs do not necessarily represent a Push community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational PIPs or follow their advice.\\n\\n## Why do PIPs matter?\\n\\nPIPs play a central role in how changes happen and are documented in the Push ecosystem. They are the way for people to propose, debate, and adopt changes. There are [different types of PIPs](https://github.com/push-protocol/PIPs/tree/main/definitions#type) including core PIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and improvements in API/RPC as well as PRCs for application standards. For example, [Verification Proof](https://github.com/push-protocol/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification/Verification) or [Identity](https://github.com/push-protocol/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification/Identity) for Notifications is described in PRC to create a standard.\\n\\n## What is the lifecycle of a PIP?\\n\\nJust like passing a new law, the approval process of a PIP involves various stages of discussion, editing, and review. Variations in this process are based on the type of proposal we have at hand and the timeline for discussion which might be set by the editor. In broad terms, all PIPs follow a standard process that includes the following steps:\\n\\n![Lifecycle](./image-1.png)\\n\\n1. <b>Ideation:</b> Any ideas for new changes or development of the Push ecosystem are presented and discussed over the <a href=\\"https://gov.push.org/c/pip/29\\">Push\u2019s governance forum</a> or discord. If members find this idea worth pursuing, it is presented as a documented PIP to the larger community of Push developers.\\n2. <b>Drafting:</b> This is the first formal step in proposal development where the authors of a new idea create a technical draft of their vision. To submit a draft, authors should submit a Pull Request (PR) against an issue in the PIPs repository.\\n3. <b>Reviewing:</b> After the preliminary vetting process, a new draft is open for feedback from editors, reviewers, and any interested parties. This stage involves a large-scale audit of a given proposal where authors invite insights on their development plan from the Web3 community.\\n4. <b>Last call:</b> This is the final window for the reviewing stage after which the PIP gets finalized. The editor provides a deadline (typically two weeks), after which a given proposal will not accept any new suggestions. In case any significant changes are needed, the proposal goes back to the reviewing stage.\\n5. <b>Final:</b> After passing the last call stage, a proposal is accepted as a final or implementable standard. The only modifications at this point can be made to correct errata or add non-normative clarifications.\\n\\nIn certain cases, the lifecycle of a PIP can undergo special stages such as:\\n\\n<b>Stagnant:</b> Any proposal which remains inactive for a period of 4 months or more in the Draft/Review/Last Call state is considered stale. Such a proposal may be resurrected from this state by Authors or Editors who can move it back to an earlier status. If not resurrected, the proposal stays stagnant forever.\\n\\n<b>Withdrawn:</b> If the authors of a proposal withdraw their submission, it is considered a finality that cannot be retracted. If the same idea is to be pursued at a later stage, it is launched as a new proposal.\\n\\n<b>Living:</b> This is a special status designated to PIPs which are expected to undergo continued updates. Such proposals never reach a state of finality and remain in an editing loop for their whole lifecycle. An example of such a proposal is PIP-1.\\n\\n## How can builders contribute towards improving Push?\\n\\nThe Push ecosystem is addressing a gap in critical blockchain infrastructure by enabling native communication between protocols, dapps, and wallets.

As such, users of Boba Network can receive decentralized push notifications pertaining to asset bridging.\\n\\n## Boba Network: Ethereum Layer2 for the Masses\\n\\nBoba Network is touted to be the people\u2019s layer-2 for Ethereum that prioritizes developers and users. At its core, it is an L2 Ethereum scaling and augmenting solution. It features extensible smart contracts that allow developers to build the next generation of DApps that invoke the web-scale infrastructure. Boba offers community-driven liquidity pools while facilitating fast exits and giving LPs incentivized yield farming opportunities.\\n\\nMoreover, the Boba Network allows faster transactions, hybrid computing, lower gas fees, and Ethereum-level security for users. Users can also seamlessly move digital assets, including NFTs from Ethereum L1 to L2. As such, this novel network can benefit from a decentralized communication channel that allows direct communication with its users to keep them updated about the various activities on the network. This is where the collaboration with Push Protocol comes into play.\\n\\n## What Does the Integration Entail?\\n\\nThrough our integration with Boba Network, we envision the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to directly interact with its users. This channel will be housed on the Push platform and users of Boba Network can subscribe to it to receive decentralized push notifications on their devices. They can expect to receive notifications whenever:\\n\\n- Their assets are bridged into the Boba Chain\\n- Governance proposals are up for voting\\n- The results of the voting are declared\\n\\nThis allows users to grab the governance and investment opportunities on Boba Network at the right time. Push has a Chrome extension, a dapp, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe\u2019re pleased to collaborate with Boba Network on their journey and Stay tuned for more announcements in the coming week!\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n## About Boba Network\\n\\nBoba is a \u201cMultichain \u201c L2 Ethereum scaling & augmenting solution built by the Enya team as core contributors to the OMG Foundation. It leverages Optimistic roll-up technology and allows developers to build the next generation of DApps and DeFi protocols.\\n\\nStay in touch: [Website](https://boba.network/) and [docs](https://docs.boba.network/)."},{"id":"push-monthly-blocks-october","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-monthly-blocks-october","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-03-push-monthly-blocks-october/index.md","title":"Push Monthly Blocks","description":"Cover image of Push Monthly Blocks","date":"2022-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 3, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Pushprotocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/pushprotocol"}],"readingTime":2.84,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-monthly-blocks-october","title":"Push Monthly Blocks","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Hello Push fam \ud83c\udf8e.

These opportunities, though profitable, are highly risky. So, average investors looking for steady growth of income with minimum risks, are left out of the DeFi revolution. This is where financial products like index funds could make a huge difference. By bringing together a portfolio of top stocks or bonds in a market, index funds let users benefit from the growth of the market without risk exposure.\\n\\nAs such, Phuture Finance is a DeFi protocol that is bringing index funds to the DeFi realm to cater to every day, risk-averse investors. And we at Push are thrilled to announce our strategic partnership with Phuture Finance.\\n\\n## How Phuture Integrates Push\\n\\nAs a crypto index platform, Phuture is designed to simplify investments through themed index funds. For instance, with its product Phuture DeFi Index (PDI), the platform brings together top DeFi assets (by market cap) on Ethereum. This allows users to capitalize on the overall growth of DeFi while minimizing the risks that come with each of these products individually. Along with PDI, the platform plans to build a whole host of other indexes that let users capitalize on various DeFi trends.\\n\\nNow, on a platform like Phuture where users invest in a financial product, they regularly check for updates on their investment. But Phuture Finance through its partnership with Push aims to directly deliver these updates to users. This not only improves the user experience on the platform but also allows users to take the required action on time.\\n\\nTo receive these updates, users of Phuture can simply subscribe to its channel on the Push platform. By doing so, they receive notifications whenever:\\n\\n- An index they\u2019ve invested in has been rebalanced\\n- An index they\u2019ve invested in does +x% in a week\\n  In the near future, we expect to integrate more use cases, bringing updates on all events to the Phuture platform. The best part is that users can receive these notifications on any device of their choosing. And these decentralized push notifications allow users to stay on top of their investments at all times.\\n\\nAs Phuture works towards making DeFi more accessible with index funds, we\u2019re enthralled to partner with them and hope to continue this alliance into the future.\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n### About Phuture Finance\\n\\n[Phuture](https://www.phuture.finance/) (PHTR) is a decentralized crypto index platform that simplifies investments through automated, themed index funds on Ethereum.

Users are disconnected when connecting to digital assets and worlds; Push Protocol aims to change that. With the current web3 experience, it is not practical to expect meaningful and valuable interactions without a robust communication method.\\n\\n## Recalling the Metaverse: A Participatory Digital Society\\n\\nThe metaverse is an ambiguous idea and does not necessarily have to depend on a blockchain to exist. However, metaverse-based projects that use blockchain as their underlying infrastructure lack a means for communication. This necessary component is needed to deliver the intended socio-economic potential of the metaverse.\\n\\nThe metaverse can be interpreted in many ways and analyzed through different disciplines. Still, in general, the metaverse attempts to redefine how we interact and transact with one another through a participatory digital society. The metaverse requires a novel communication method that allows us to become active participants in the said digital society.\\n\\nThe two key things we mentioned here:\\n\\n- The socio-economic potential of the metaverse requires a means of communication.\\n- Communication within the metaverse allows us to become participants in a digital society.\\n\\n## Meta-communication in the Metaverse\\n\\nPush Protocol is ready for meta-communication. As a universal and chain-agnostic protocol, Push can be used as the communication mechanism to send messages and real-time updates about activity in the metaverse. Digital entities within the metaverse can cross-communicate with one another. Creators can benefit from the frictionless experience of Push by forming direct communication channels with their audiences. Users can schedule actions in the metaverse based on automatic updates fostered through Push. Becoming the native communication layer means that Push protocol taps into multiple platforms, implementing meta-communication across the metaverse and web3.\\n\\nA project that recently integrated Push into their metaverse tech stack was [Decentraland](https://medium.com/u/98348dd48afe?source=post_page-----7efbda6d9b80--------------------------------), a virtual destination for digital assets. Decentraland contains a DAO that drives the direction of the virtual land. Users can propose all sorts of additions and improvements through the DAO. For instance, a user may want to add an example of the Eiffel tower at a specific location on the virtual land. The challenge is that other users must constantly check the latest proposals and continuously engage with the platform to raise their opinion and vote. With Push Protocol, the DAO can trigger a notification that broadcasts to all subscribed users through a dedicated Decentraland DAO communication channel about the Eiffel tower proposal. The image below illustrates this scenario:\\n\\n![Decentraland](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nConsider another example, this time based on managing your digital assets. You\u2019ve listed an NFT for trade in a metaverse marketplace and aren\u2019t aware of the offers being made. Nor are you aware of the general market or anything beyond what you already know about your potential trade. With push notifications, the marketplace can send you a message each time certain activities occur on-chain, such as another user bidding on your NFT.\\n\\n## How Can We Push NFTs?\\n\\nMany of us have been to web3-based events and received an NFT for attending or participating. Imagine you have just attended a speculator workshop about one of your favorite crypto projects and received an NFT for being a participant. You\u2019re excited to look back at the NFT the next time you open your wallet as a way to connect with your cool experience.\\n\\n## Engage with Users\\n\\nBut, it usually stops there. The NFT is lonely and picking up digital dust, staying static at your address. Imagine the NFTs could talk to each other. Based on specific data queries on addresses that hold NFTs as part of the same collection, users can push messages to each other\u2019s wallets. NFTs can also notify users about how other NFTs are being used.\\n\\nAnd we can consider the other perspective with the NFT provider(s): wouldn\u2019t it be great to have a method of communication to keep in touch with participants, community members, and contributors instead of closing the doors on each other after they\u2019ve left your event? Your team just ran an excellent crypto event and managed to give out more than 200 NFTs to participants. While you\u2019re stoked about the successful event you ran, you know that after the participants mint their NFTs, they will sit in their wallets, gathering dust, and the interactions between you and them likely won\u2019t exist. The diagram below shows an example of how Push protocol can communicate with NFT holders and establish a connection as long as they\u2019d like to subscribe.\\n\\n![Engage With Users](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n<i>The metaverse and the digital assets within the blockchain space have proclaimed a message without being able to message: we need decentralized communication middleware, and Push Protocol offers just that.</i><br/><br/>\\n\\nWhile we named a few use cases in this article that relate to the metaverse and NFTs, there are plenty more, and we encourage you to start building yourself!\\n\\n<i>By Danny Salman</i>"},{"id":"beincrypto-collaborates-with-push-to-bring-industry-news-and-high-quality-content-directly-to","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/beincrypto-collaborates-with-push-to-bring-industry-news-and-high-quality-content-directly-to","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-13-beincrypto-push/index.md","title":"BeInCrypto Collaborates With Push to Bring Industry News and High-Quality Content Directly to Readers\u2019 Wallets","description":"Cover image of BeInCrypto Collaborates With Push to Bring Industry News and High-Quality Content Directly to Readers\u2019 Wallets","date":"2022-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 13, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Announcements","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/announcements"},{"label":"Push Notification","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-notification"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Polygon","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/polygon"}],"readingTime":1.4066666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"beincrypto-collaborates-with-push-to-bring-industry-news-and-high-quality-content-directly-to","title":"BeInCrypto Collaborates With Push to Bring Industry News and High-Quality Content Directly to Readers\u2019 Wallets","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"BeInCrypto, one of the most popular cryptocurrency news websites, strikes a strategic alliance with Push to deliver the daily dose of news directly to readers\u2019 wallets.

Powered by Push Protocol.<br/>\\n\\nToday, we\u2019re excited to announce the next evolution in Push Protocol: Push Chat!\\n\\nPush Chat is a wallet-to-wallet communication protocol that will accelerate the growth and value of web3 applications and communities alike. We are launching the Push Chat alpha and opening up access to select users across the Push community. To learn how to get access to the alpha, see \u201cPush Chat Alpha Access\u201d below.\\n\\n## The TL;DR about Push Chat\\n\\nThe Push Chat alpha allows anyone with a wallet or an ENS to chat with others directly through the Push Chat application ([app.push.org](http://app.push.org/)). Text, GIFs, and images are supported in the alpha. With a couple of web3 steps added in, Push Chat operates just like a typical messaging application \u2014 just web3-native. Features to be added down the road include video, group chat, payments, transfers, live chat, and more.\\n\\nPolygon Wallet is a launch partner for Push Chat, setting the stage for the intra-wallet chat that allows users to stay entirely within their wallets to communicate instead of jumping in between applications.\\n\\n## Push Chat Alpha Access\\n\\nStarting today, October 10, access to the Push Chat alpha is available to the following individuals. (If you\u2019re not part of these groups, don\u2019t sweat! We\u2019ll be rolling out more alpha access to the communities in the weeks to come, and the full public launch isn\u2019t too far behind \ud83d\ude42).\\n\\n- <b>ETH Bogota Hackers</b>. If you were a developer who hacked with Push Protocol during ETH Bogota this year, come try out the alpha! More information is in the <a href=\\"https://discord.gg/pushprotocol\\">Push Discord</a>.\\n- <b>Alpha POAP Holders</b>. If you have a POAP from the Push team handed out in Bogota, you can access the alpha. <i>Come find the Push team at Devcon (Push has a booth on Day 3 & 4 of Devcon!) and other events in Bogota and ask for a POAP</i>.\\n\\nIf you are part of the Push Chat alpha, your feedback will be important to the success of the app when it goes public. [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) and leave your thoughts and feedback in the #push-chat-alpha channel.\\n\\nIf you don\u2019t join the Push Chat alpha \u2014 no worries! The public app will be available soon \u2014 stay tuned.\\n\\n## From Notifications to Chat (and Beyond): The Push Journey\\n\\nIn 2020, we launched as Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) to bring to market a clear and valuable product: push notifications on Ethereum. Push notifications are a core component of the daily user experience in web2. Much of our daily interaction with apps, services, and one another is prompted with push notifications. Since launching on mainnet in early 2022, Push Protocol has powered over 18 million notifications across 100 channels to nearly 60k subscribers.\\n\\nThe next frontier, we knew, was another core component of the daily user experience in web2: messaging. Even more than push notifications, global peer-to-peer digital communication has become a cornerstone of our society. Our reliance on web2 chat applications, however, has a long history of privacy concerns, data exploitation, censorship, human rights concerns, and poor user experience.\\n\\nWe knew that messaging would eventually find its home in web3 not as a feature, but as a fundamental building block for decentralized infrastructure. We started working to bring the lessons and the success from building push notifications into the next primitive of blockchain applications: chat.\\n\\n## Push Protocol: A Rebrand for the Future\\n\\nBefore we could launch Push Chat, we had to deal with the fact that much of our market branding to date has focused on push notifications. Not just that, but push notifications on Ethereum. If we wished to move beyond push notifications to include chat, we also knew that chat would need to be available to any web3 user, no matter which blockchain their app operated on.\\n\\nSo, in September 2022, EPNS [announced its rebrand](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1574771582790406144) to Push Protocol! Push is the multi-chain communication platform of web3. It powers any type of communication on any decentralized network, helping to better connect apps, services, developers, and users. And our rebrand wasn\u2019t just for kicks. Two days after the rebrand, we announced that Push Protocol was [live on Polygon\u2019s mainnet](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1575485566065381377), capable of powering notifications for the thousands of apps and hundreds of thousands of active users.\\n\\nWith new branding that nods to our roots, we are <i>pushing forward the future of web3 with robust, decentralized, and user-friendly communication for all</i>.\\n\\n## The Vision for Push Chat\\n\\nCrypto has been on \u201csingle player mode.\u201d By that, we mean that interaction has largely been single-direction. Apps communicate through monolithic communication methods. When communities do come together to talk to one another, they are forced to do so outside of the technology stack they are so passionate about.\\n\\nAnd yet\u2026the crypto market has seen unparalleled growth, driven by the sheer devotion that users have to the technology and their willingness to put up with an imperfect user experience. What if we unlock \u201cmultiplayer\u201d mode in web3, and enable all the players of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s ecosystem to communicate with each other directly with the technology they\u2019re building? The growth that will spark is parabolic.\\n\\nExpressive, \u201cmulti-player,\u201d web3-native experiences have been missing. When we bring chat and communication into the web3 stack, we begin to unlock composability and capabilities that have been impossible today unless web2 chat platforms have elected to build web3-compatible features.\\n\\nThe opportunity of Push Chat for developers will be to build better communication systems embedded into users\u2019 everyday applications. Chatbots to automate communication and customer support. DAO communications to members and amongst members; including governance discussions. Wallet developers in particular have blank space to start integrating communication directly into user wallets, unlocking an entirely new paradigm for the way in which we use our wallets on a daily basis.\\n\\nBut, we don\u2019t believe chat is just a feature. It is a core piece of the infrastructure of the decentralized internet, enabling any person, service, or app to communicate with others without barriers or borders. Our vision is for Push Chat to power every form of communication that occurs on the new internet that is being built. It\u2019s a lofty vision, but one we\u2019re excited to build with our community.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nPush Chat is the next evolution in web3-native communication. Push Protocol has spent 2 years building the most widely-adopted push notification service in web3. With Push Chat, we are delivering on our promise to create the most useful, adopted, and user-friendly communication protocol for web3.

Today, we are excited to announce, some old, and some new friends are combining forces with Push to grow and strengthen their presence in the Polygon ecosystem.\\n\\nIn today\u2019s post, we are going to explore some of the use cases of these frens supported by Push.\\n\\n## Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Provides Transactional Updates with Push Notifications\\n\\nDeFi has proven itself to be a key pillar of web3 since the start of DeFi Summer. Every day, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people are executing transactions, buying & selling, borrowing & lending, yield farming, and doing all kinds of activities on various dapps. Even though there have been major developments and upgrades on the application level and the smart contract level, UX still remains one of the main friction points. Users need to keep themselves informed about the projects they are trading on via Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. If users forget to check updates for some time, god forbid their loan might be liquidated or their position might be closed out because of some unexpected events that happened when they weren\u2019t checking.\\n\\nThis is where notifications come in handy and why Push is very proud to announce it is bringing the critical notification solution to DeFi dapps on Polygon. Use cases we have established with our partners, such as [QiDao](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x994909594Ef6c80cE8d9C85Ad30AeC696E10f73E) and [Mean Finance](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x2f5ccA6f594118ef54f4157927A323BaA982Fd78) are to remind their users when their loan or collateral is approaching liquidation and other key stats which are critical for users to take urgent actions upon. For educational and fun DeFi projects such as [GoodGhosting](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xe8381F84a32A4C2B08c328BfF68c0E889a34F255), Push is keeping its users updated on the latest pool and round start dates so users can participate in those pools on time to enjoy the full benefits. For those gamblers in web3 (aren\u2019t we all), Push is alerting users of [Pool Together](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xdc0964aaacE97CF4E7476B4EEbC924730E524ade) on changes in the prize pool and if they win in any of the four governance-managed prize pools.\\n\\n## Governance Teams Increase Voting Turnout, Powered by Push\\n\\nGovernance is one of the most common use cases for Push notifications. DAOs and the governance team in web3 know the pain of having to constantly remind communities to vote on important issues all too well, only to be blamed afterward if some members did not see any notification in the first place and missed out. To use [MahaDAO](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x64A971F0D01b3555Ac60B9Bd151d5B7A75cf12Fd) as an example, MahaDAO is using push notifications to inform its community when a new governance proposal is made and is ready for voting, so the governance manager never has to worry about turnout again.\\n\\n## Push Notifications Help NFT and Gaming Projects Keep Players on the Hook\\n\\nMuch hope and excitement have been put into web3 gaming and NFT space. Despite the huge influx of funding flowing into the space, UX and the sophistication of gaming design are still very much a work in progress. Smooth onboarding of users, In-depth understanding of players and players\u2019 community will help to accelerate the mass adoption of blockchain-based gaming. Push is working together with leading gaming teams such as [Polychain Monster](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x27F68B2C092DB48928D70EA781F7dE8B844ad07B) to enable direct communications between players and platforms. Players will receive notifications regarding their rewards, game updates, or airdrop of any rare NFTs, keeping them well-informed of the progress they\u2019ve made in the game and players are more likely to stay.\\n\\n## Tooling Offers Smooth User Journey with Push\\n\\nWeb3 is eating up web2, starting with the metamorphosis of various web2 tooling. ETH Sign is a perfect example of evolving from an established web2 tech solution, taking it on-chain to facilitate immutable and verifiable document signing. With Push, [ETH Sign](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x77f319B1d9c43a8B729399f81515166632100744) is able to notify signees at each step of the signing process while making sure comments are seen and checked.\\n\\n## In the Web3 World, We Push Together\\n\\nWhile the use cases listed above provide a good first view of the extensive capabilities of Push notifications, it\u2019s important to remember that new use cases are emerging every day. Using notifications to increase UX, product stickiness, and community engagement is a feat many developers strive for and this trend will continue to drive more demand toward notification services that offer the most smooth, customized, and reliable solutions that stand out in comparison to legacy alternatives.\\n\\nIf you are a developer and want to quickly get your application integrated with Push, don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) or reach us via our social media channels below."},{"id":"push-and-lens-powering-ux-with-notifications-and-aaves-lens","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-and-lens-powering-ux-with-notifications-and-aaves-lens","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-03-powering-ux-with-notifications-and-lens/index.md","title":"Push and Lens: Powering UX with Notifications and Aave\u2019s Lens","description":"Cover image of Push and Lens: Powering UX with Notifications and Aave\u2019s Lens","date":"2022-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 3, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Social Media","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/social-media"},{"label":"Infrastructure","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/infrastructure"},{"label":"Announcements","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/announcements"}],"readingTime":2.6633333333333336,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-and-lens-powering-ux-with-notifications-and-aaves-lens","title":"Push and Lens: Powering UX with Notifications and Aave\u2019s Lens","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We\u2019re excited to announce the first protocol to use Push on the Polygon mainnet: Lens Protocol!

Our recent announcement of support for the Polygon network marks a new phase for Push and the world of multi-chain communication. We could not be more thrilled for the incredible team at Lens to be the first to integrate Push and power push notifications for their users.\\n\\n## Lens and Push: Communication for Web3 Social Media\\n\\nCensorship-resistant dapps are steadily replacing centralized social platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. Every day, we see an increased demand for social apps that allow content ownership and free speech.\\n\\n[Lens Protocol](https://lens.xyz/) is the building block of web3 social. It enables the development of decentralized social applications that can be used to create, own, and monetize their content without the risk of censorship. Launched in May 2022 by Aave Companies, Lens Protocol\u2019s tech stack for building decentralized social apps is live on Polygon and is already powering over 100 decentralized social media dapps. Those include: [Lenster](https://lenster.xyz/), a decentralized Twitter; [Lenstube](https://lenstube.xyz/), a decentralized video-sharing, think TikTok and YouTube; [Refract](https://refract.withlens.app/), a decentralized link forum think [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and others. Since its mainnet launch, the Lens API has had almost [3 million](https://twitter.com/lensprotocol/status/1565062620310372353?s=21) transactions, and over 70 thousand Lens profiles have been created.\\n\\nIn the world of social media, apps use notifications to keep us connected to our friends, work, and more. Today, Push is happy to work with Lens Protocol to let you stay on top of what is most important to you in your digital life!\\n\\nWith this collaboration, Push will power web3 notifications in the Lens ecosystem and create the best and most user-centric social experience. In version 1 of the Push integration, Lens can enable notifications to be sent to Lens profiles to better ensure communication and engagement around an event occurring with their profile, such as comments. Users can [opt-in](http://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xef6426D522CfE5B7Ae5dB05623aB0Ef78023dBe0) to the channel now, and start receiving notifications soon.\\n\\n## Building the Best Web3 Experience Layer With Lens\\n\\nWe are excited to be working with the Lens team to build out the best web3 native \u201cExperience Layer.\u201d Among those possible notifications, we anticipate building customizable notifications (likes, follow, etc) for Lens profile holders in future versions of this integration. Users have the ability to opt-in and out of the types of notifications they would like to receive and create customized notifications on top of Push that are tailored towards their own needs.\\n\\n\u201cThe Aave Companies is excited to be at the forefront of innovation having Lens Protocol be the first integration on to the Push Protocol,\u201d said <b>Stani Kulechov, Founder of Lens and CEO of the Aave Companies</b>. \u201cCommunication is crucial to social networking and bringing easy-to-use tools for engagement as well as allowing for further notification customization capabilities will make the Web3 experience on Polygon more accessible and user-friendly.\u201d\\n\\nLens is quickly becoming the go-to solution for building web3 social media. By using Push, dapps building on top of Lens are able to target the right users, increase user retention, boost adoption, and increase dapp engagement. All these benefits also translate to better UX. Such a key piece of infrastructure has been lacking in web3, and Push is proud to solve that piece of the puzzle and help better the user experience for the crypto community.\\n\\n\u201cWhile Lens allows users to create their own social graph and get complete control of their data, content, and community, Push Protocol provides a decentralized and chain-agnostic communication bridge for the entire web3 world,\u201d said <b>Harsh Rajat, Founder of Push Protocol</b>.\\n\\nAave\u2019s team built one of the leading DeFi dapps with over [$6.6 billion in TVL](https://defillama.com/protocol/aave). Now, the future of social media is here, and it is decentralized. We\u2019re excited to grow with Lens Protocol innovating web3 social, and looking forward to working with Lens to innovate web3 social and improve the way that blockchain technology can serve society.\\n\\nIn web3 social media, we Push together.\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n### About Lens Protocol\\n\\nThe Lens Protocol is a Web3 social graph on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake blockchain designed to empower creators to own the links between themselves and their community, forming a fully composable, user-owned social graph.

Soon, Push Protocol will announce launch partners to allow users to begin subscribing to live channels, opting to receive notifications when certain on- or off-chain conditions are met.\\n\\n## Polygon & Push\\n\\nPolygon, previously Matic Network, is a suite of layer 2 protocols backed by an ecosystem of next-generation apps. Polygon has a range of products that aim to solve the underlying challenges with traditional blockchain architectures, all while improving the user experience for end-users to support the mass adoption of web3 products and services. Push Protocol\u2019s launch on Polygon will address the lack of communication between apps and users to support the Polygon ecosystem in improving the web3 user experience.\\n\\nMore than 37,000 apps are built on Polygon, offering a tremendous opportunity to create custom communication channels and user-based messages that users, developers, and stakeholders will benefit from. As with other apps, developers can easily add a notification service to their Polygon-based app and enable app-to-wallet communication. Users on Polygon can use wallet-to-wallet communication for just about anything.\\n\\nLately, Polygon has become the go-to platform for web2-based institutions to onboard into web3, such as Meta, Adobe, Stripe, and Starbucks. The new dapps built by these institutions can benefit from the flexible communication offered by Push Protocol, which gives them the ability to have direct control over messages, all while preventing spam. Users expect applications in web3 to provide a similar standard of user experience as they do with the applications they currently use daily. Users interacting with apps on Polygon will have the same user experience they do today when on these platforms by using Push Protocol.\\n\\nSmart contracts on Polygon powered by Push Protocol can include notifications that can reach any wallet, app, mobile app, and plugin. Push\u2019s mainnet launch was in January 2022. Since then, the protocol has powered 17 million notifications on over 100 channels to close to 60,000 subscribers, making it the largest decentralized communication platform in web3.\\n\\n<i>\u201cPush Protocol represents a fundamental communication layer for web3 that is sorely missing. By unlocking instant, direct notifications within the Polygon ecosystem and beyond, Push evolves the services many of us take for granted \u2014 bringing us one step closer to a truly composable and decentralized web.\u201d</i> said Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon.<br/><br/>\\n\\n<i>\u201cOur launch on the Polygon mainnet, immediately following our rebrand from EPNS to Push Protocol, is a pivotal moment for our ecosystem. Communication is a critical component for the future of the internet, and Push is rapidly expanding beyond the Ethereum network and beyond push notifications by building the missing piece of web3,\u201d</i> said Harsh Rajat, co-founder of Push Protocol.<br/><br/>\\n\\nThe recent rebrand from EPNS to Push signals two evolutions from the service: the move beyond Ethereum and the move beyond push notifications to all forms of communication. Today\u2019s announcement about Polygon\u2019s integration of Push Protocol is the service\u2019s first move into multi-chain, with more announcements about networks and communication types on the horizon. Let\u2019s push for web3 communication!\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n### About Polygon\\n\\n[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) is the leading blockchain development platform, offering scalable, affordable, secure, and sustainable blockchains for Web3. Its growing suite of products offers developers easy access to major scaling solutions including L2 (ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups), sidechains, hybrid, stand-alone, and enterprise chains, and data availability.

The rebrand signifies the network\u2019s move beyond Ethereum to other blockchains and beyond push notifications to all forms of communication. The existing channels, notifications, $PUSH token, and app all remain unchanged. Learn more at [push.org](http://www.push.org/).\\n\\nDear EPNS family,\\n\\nToday, we are announcing a significant milestone for the protocol and community: EPNS is rebranding to <b>Push Protocol!</b> The rebranding of EPNS will take effect today. All existing EPNS implementations will remain the same, but the rebranding marks the beginning of the next phase of decentralized communication in web3.\\n\\nThe groundwork for the rebrand from EPNS to Push Protocol was laid a long time ago. This next step marks the beginning of two fundamental evolutions in EPNS\\n\\n1. <b>Moving beyond Ethereum to other L1s and L2s</b>\\n2. <b>Moving beyond push notifications to all forms of communication</b>\\n\\nPush Protocol will continue to evolve by enabling flexible and decentralized middleware that serves as a public good to solve the decentralized communication problem.\\n\\nA communication protocol must be able to adapt to changing environments, constantly meet user needs and communication methods, and facilitate easy upgrades to be considered future-proof. The web3 communication layer of today should not look the same in twenty years, as we will likely change how we communicate and notify each other. Push Protocol is ready for this.\\n\\n## What is (was) EPNS Anyway?\\n\\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is a push notification protocol for web3. It enables any dapp or user to send out notifications to an audience that has subscribed to a specific channel (anyone who sends a notification is considered a channel in EPNS). Since the mainnet launch in January 2022, EPNS has powered over 17 million notifications across 100 channels to nearly 60k subscribers.\\n\\nThere are two actors in the original EPNS architecture: <b>publisher</b> and <b>subscriber</b>. As a publisher, you can rely on a transparent, secure, decentralized network of nodes that facilitate peer-to-peer notifications to channels. The network includes an incentivization scheme that rewards those maintaining the network while ensuring notifications are delivered correctly and messages are untampered with. EPNS (now Push Protocol) can also send out messages automatically triggered based on certain on-chain events.\\n\\nAs a subscriber, you should control what channels you subscribe to and know what to expect. The service is user-centric and stands by a user-first philosophy: an easy opt-in mechanism to subscribe to notifications that meet user needs. Not to mention, the protocol scores all messages to protect against spamming.\\n\\n## What is Push Protocol? A Generalizable Communication Solution\\n\\nPush Protocol is the next evolution in communication, built on top of nearly a year of proven mainnet adoption by EPNS. Push Protocol retains all the push notification capability of EPNS, and also lays the groundwork for multi-chain, general-purpose communication.\\n\\nCommunication is everywhere, and Push Protocol can fill the communication gap to get information across the web. To truly meet the original vision of EPNS, that is, being a platform agnostic and flexible protocol, this is a crucial next step to scale the protocol and make it as compatible as possible with all types of technology stacks and solutions.\\n\\nPush Protocol is already integrated with dozens of dapps across the web3 space, each with their own approach to deliver wallet-to-wallet and wallet-to-dapp messaging. As Push is an open communication solution, the protocol will progress with contributors from all platforms.\\n\\n## The Future of Communication: Web3 UX starts with Messaging\\n\\nPush Protocol keeps web3 users and web3 developers engaged with each other, all in real-time. Whether you only use a wallet to manage a few assets, are an active community member for one of your favorite projects, or building a state-of-the-art dapp, you should be able to feel like you are part of a flourishing web3 ecosystem; being able to reach all platforms and not be subject to interact with the new web in isolation.\\n\\nWe are super excited to take on this journey with you and can\u2019t wait for what the future holds!

As such, users of Commonwealth are poised to receive decentralized push notifications pertaining to the governance process. These notifications increase user participation and keep users updated about every step in the governance lifecycle.\\n\\n## Commonwealth: On-chain Governance Simplified\\n\\nCommonwealth is all-in-one governance and community management protocol. On this platform, anyone can create a community, link their governance contracts, and manage their communities with ease. The core functionalities of Discourse, Snapshot, on-chain voting, synchronous chat tools, and network analytics are all available on one platform for users\\n\\nWhether it is community discussions, treasury management, crowdfunding, or decentralized governance, crypto projects can rely on one go-to platform, making the process easy and accessible.\\n\\nAs such, the platform can benefit from a communication medium that keeps users updated about all the steps in the governance and discussion processes, encouraging user participation. This is where EPNS plays a key role.\\n\\n## What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our collaboration with Commonwealth, we envision the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to interact directly with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and users of Commonwealth can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications at every step of the governance process like whenever\\n\\n- New proposals are up for voting\\n- The voting process is about to end\\n- The results of the voting are declared\\n\\nThis allows users to grab the governance opportunities on Commonwealth at the right time. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a dapp, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe\u2019re pleased to collaborate with Commonwealth on their journey towards bringing communities together for on-chain events and hope to continue the alliance into the future.\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n### About Commonwealth\\n\\nCommonwealth is a governance and community management protocol. The protocol enables users to claim and govern their communities. Anyone can create a community, link their governance methodology, and discuss the future of their specific community.\\n\\nStay in touch!

Many on-chain governance systems have low voter turnout, which is a result of many things, one being poor user experience.\\n\\nWhat if you\u2019re a core contributor to the DAO, trusted by the DAO to uphold specific responsibilities and keep the community informed? Updates to the DAO can be transmitted over a communication channel to tell community members about the latest updates and what to look out for directly on their accounts.\\n\\nWeb3 communities must start to limit their dependence on platforms like Discord for their communication and use [EPNS\u2019 communication channels](https://app.epns.io/) to serve information to the community directly.\\n\\nAs a core contributor to a DAO, who the members trust to uphold specific responsibilities, you can keep members informed in real time. Some fallbacks can be implemented, as dapps can immediately notify users of potentially malicious behavior of a core contributor or representative of the DAO based on that individual\u2019s on-chain events. Imagine how many incidents EPNS can prevent with a simple communication channel integration.\\n\\n## A Communication Layer Empowers Decentralized Creativity\\n\\nWe\u2019ve heard it a few times \u2014 web3 needs push notifications; end users and developers need communication and a way to create awareness about important information: EPNS? We hope EPNS can serve as a public good for messaging, but a communication layer for web3 sparks more innovation and solves a significant user experience problem.\\n\\nA creator economy with poor user experience is unsustainable, and creators should not operate in isolation; they should be able to communicate with other creators and build an ecosystem where everyone can push important information directly to the creator\u2019s interface.\\n\\nGovernance in web3 is not meant to operate on Discord, Telegram, Slack, or depend on social channels outside. In many ways, this seems counter-intuitive. Imagine if a project runs an ambassador program but only depends on Discord. The project can integrate EPNS and create program-specific channels for program members to push messages over, like an ambassador communication channel that allows ambassadors to curate communication efforts to end-users and other ambassadors. DAO updates can also benefit, as the EPNS communication layer addresses many coordination issues in generating awareness and supporting end-users.\\n\\n## What Happened Around Me Today?\\n\\nMost of us may be surprised to learn about the amount of new policies (including policy changes) introduced in our governance systems. Beyond news outlets (including journalist activities), the reality of governance systems in the real world is that there isn\u2019t a standard or format for notifying the general public about changes directly from the information source unless citizens manually look for them.\\n\\nStill, governance workers (like politicians) may keep their constituents up-to-date with push notifications via email, SMS, or even social media channels, but this depends on the politician and the medium they choose for communication. The news tends to focus on significant changes, but the risk is that they could be censoring information and likely have a bias. We are establishing a piece of software that addresses these pitfalls.\\n\\nWhat happened in web3? Well, DeFi solutions across web3 continue to integrate with EPNS to alleviate the friction with their end-users and fill the communication gap. An example of this is\\n[Bancor](https://medium.com/u/2bd55d9e5fb5?source=post_page-----1ea1e0a58ce1--------------------------------), which we mentioned in [Part 2.1](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/loan-update-high-utilization-or-low-liquidity-please-check-your-position-fe917fe7c193?postPublishedType=repub). DeFi proposals to the Bancor protocol can be game-changing, and users should have a mechanism to know about them!\\n\\n![Communication Channel](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nAnother earlier integration with EPNS was done by [MakerDAO](https://medium.com/u/743224aba00c?source=post_page-----1ea1e0a58ce1--------------------------------), which has an active governance process maintained by a set of smart contracts and a vibrant community. However, users need to constantly watch the MakerDAO governance portal or depend on social channels to know about new polls and the state of current ones. Imagine there were communication channels to send notifications about polling information directly to users.\\n\\n<i>With EPNS, MakerDAO generates awareness, encourages participation, and brings the community together.</i>\\n\\nFor example, if the DS-Chief contract in Maker elects a new rule across the protocol, users should know as soon as a rule takes effect. Suppose the rule is up for review and available to vote on. In that case, it only hurts the overall progression and strength of the protocol when users are unaware or need to check for changes, creating a constant overhead of missed updates.\\n\\n![EPNS Channels](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nWhile we named a few use cases in this article that relate to governance, there are plenty more, and we encourage you to start building yourself!\\n\\nStay up-to-date with EPNS through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/epnsproject), [Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject), [Discord](https://discord.gg/epns), [Forum](https://gov.epns.io/), [Docs](https://docs.epns.io/), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumPushNotificationService).\\n\\nAnd stay tuned for the subsequent use case article on NFTs and the Metaverse!\\n\\n<i>By Danny Salman</i>"},{"id":"loan-update-high-utilization-or-low-liquidity-please-check-your-position","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/loan-update-high-utilization-or-low-liquidity-please-check-your-position","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-12-load-update-high-utilization-low-liquidity/index.md","title":"Loan Update: High Utilization or Low Liquidity, Please Check Your Position","description":"Cover image of \'Loan Update: High Utilization or Low Liquidity, Please Check Your Position\'","date":"2022-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 12, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Pn101","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/pn-101"},{"label":"Push Notification","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-notification"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Developer","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/developer"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"}],"readingTime":2.5033333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"loan-update-high-utilization-or-low-liquidity-please-check-your-position","title":"Loan Update: High Utilization or Low Liquidity, Please Check Your Position","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Part 2 of the - An Introduction to Push Notification series will focus on use cases for push notifications in web3, and demonstrate how the web3 communication layer is the missing piece for the next iteration of the web.

In this post, we will focus on decentralized finance (DeFi).\\n\\nWhile there are trade-offs to be made, DeFi should not be a step back in financial processes or user experience. The web3 communication layer enables solutions to increase the DeFi experience significantly. Let\u2019s take some time to consider some of the current pitfalls in DeFi.\\n\\nAll financial products come with a degree of uncertainty. In centralized finance, uncertainties exist around safety, security, privacy, data integrity, and trust. However, centralized financial products work well for what they are supposed to do, with the caveat that the financial service provider controls the product and its usage. These products usually have sufficient user experiences with appropriate measures to inform users about essential information.\\n\\nAn example:\\n\\nModern financial systems use server pushes to send different information based on account activity. For instance, if you conduct a transaction from a foreign IP address, your bank\u2019s server may push a notification to you through one (or many) information channels you are subscribed to, informing you about the transaction as a security precaution.\\n\\n![Design](./image-1.png)\\n\\nBy design, decentralized financial products aim to alleviate many uncertainties in centralized finance; users can safely and securely participate in financial services without permission, control their financial data, and don\u2019t have to trust a financial service provider. DeFi products and services are still yet to reach this optimal vision. Yet, even in a world of optimal DeFi applications, the current user experience is uninformative, limits authentic engagement, and is not practical for the average user.\\n\\nToday, DeFi applications and services come with a high degree of uncertainty. DeFi users shouldn\u2019t have to manually check activity constantly or depend on individuals\u2019 efforts to release updates and findings on social channels. As unfortunate as hacks and exploits are, there should also be time-sensitive alerts about suspicious or unusual DeFi events, especially with the emergent nature of DeFi. In general, using EPNS as a communication layer enables:\\n\\n- Wallet-to-wallet and wallet-to-dapp messaging: user-centric messaging, regardless of platform or device, to communicate about the activity that matters most. Users also shouldn\u2019t experience the limitations of account-based communication that exist in the financial world today.\\n- Real-time updates about a range of DeFi primitives, such as price volatility, liquidity supply, state of liquidity pools, LP positions, loan positions, and Epoch farming.\\n\\nAnd more.\\n\\nAn example:\\n\\nTake, for instance, a DeFi asset management tool that manages LP positions in liquidity pools across different dapps. The tool\u2019s purpose is to provide and deploy dynamic LP strategies for various LP pools. The tool monitors specific statistics and transaction data to achieve this. Despite the tool\u2019s helpful service in managing assets and minimizing risk, how does the user know:\\n\\n- which pool their liquidity is in without checking?\\n- the state of the liquidity pools?\\n- if the strategies of the tool change?\\n- how to avoid a certain threshold of risk without constantly engaging with the tool?\\n\\nand so on.\\n\\nAdding EPNS as the messaging protocol to the DeFi asset management tool, wallets can opt-in notifications they find most valuable and cater those notifications to metrics they are most comfortable with, all in a gasless manner.\\n\\n![Structure](./image-2.png)\\n\\nDeFi solutions across web3 continue to integrate with EPNS to alleviate the friction with their end-users and fill the communication gap. An example of this is [Bancor](https://medium.com/u/2bd55d9e5fb5?source=post_page-----fe917fe7c193--------------------------------), a growing EVM-based AMM (automated market maker), recently integrated EPNS and has an EPNS- based communication channel where a variety of messages are pushed to Bancor users, such as updates on liquidity mining, fee changes, and new token listings, to name a few.\\n\\nPush services through push or alert nodes aren\u2019t new, but a chain agnostic solution that is robust, modular, and interoperable is yet to be established. The web3 communication layer allows for universal notifications, no matter the use case or the platform. EPNS encourages universal messaging, so dapps and wallets can talk to each other and notify their users.

It is designed to power the next generation of DeFi, NFT, GameFi, and metaverse projects.\\n\\nThe high scalability, instantaneous transactions, and low gas fees are enabled by the novel nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus that evades wasteful mining. Reef Chain is EVM-compatible and allows developers to easily integrate their existing dapps and protocols without changing the base code.\\n\\nThis novel blockchain network also supports wrapped ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to transfer liquidity and take advantage of its speed, affordability, and efficiency. The chain is self-upgradable and completely evades the need for hard forks.\\n\\nAs such, this next-generation blockchain can benefit from a decentralized communication mechanism that allows the network to directly communicate with its users. And, we at EPNS are proud to announce our strategic collaboration with [Reef](https://medium.com/u/4f1649b3658b?source=post_page-----f5e80bb632ff--------------------------------).\\n\\n## How Reef Chain Integrates EPNS\\n\\nThis collaboration between EPNS and Reef Chain will allow the network to directly communicate and deliver platform updates to users through decentralized push notifications. These timely push notifications will allow users to take required action and grab various opportunities on the network with ease. It also reduces their dependency on centralized communication platforms and saves them the hassle of manually checking for updates. The best part is that users can receive these push notifications on any device of their choice.\\n\\nIn the first stage of this integration, users are poised to receive notifications whenever their assets are successfully bridged from the mainnet. Later on, we expect to deliver push notifications for various other activities on the chain including governance updates, and loan liquidation alerts.\\n\\nWe are enthralled by the possibilities of this association with Reef Chain and hope to continue the alliance into the future.\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n### About Reef\\n\\nReef is an EVM-first blockchain designed to make Web3 accessible for the next billion users. Reef offers high scalability, and affordable transactions, and utilizes Nominated Proof of Stake, extensible EVM, and on-chain upgradability. Reef is the future blockchain for NFTs, DeFi, and gaming.

Middleware also provides services that are not present in the operating system. The push notification service provider is an example of this, known as an operating system push notification service (OSPNS). For instance, the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) lives on iPhone devices as an OSPNS middleware software.\\n\\n## Taking the Push Notification Provider Away From the Notifications\\n\\nWeb3 moves away from the traditional client-server model and alleviates today\u2019s power concentration over the control and truth of information and data. Web3 attempts to take service providers away from services, where middleware becomes trustless software (but can still be trustful) that offers security guarantees and robust communication through decentralization. Web3 also attempts to reconfigure how we monetize things in society and redirect incentives to where they should go, users, participants, communities, and those generating value.\\n\\nAddressing the limitations of push technology while utilizing its features in the next iteration of the web requires an OSPNS-like piece of middleware. There needs to be a similar layer of abstraction and push technology primitives that allow notifications to create a web3-based OSPNS.\\n\\n## Enter Web3 Push Notifications\\n\\n[The Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)](https://epns.io/): a decentralized OSPNS for push notifications; the open communication layer for web3.\\n\\n![Project Stacks](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nEPNS addresses the user experience problem in web3 by providing push notifications for wallets and dapps. EPNS allows any dapp, smart contract, backend, protocol, or, in principle, any distributed technology to send communication directly to user wallet addresses in an open, feeless, and platform-agnostic way. Being an open and permissionless protocol, anyone can create dedicated channels to distribute information directly to user wallets without needing to rely on centralized service providers. The protocol serves many communication primitives beyond simple push notifications, such as peer-to-peer chatting, communication channel creation, and on-chain governance. In addition, EPNS addresses information and content censorship as the protocol allows users and applications to control the content they\u2019d like to push.\\n\\nWeb3 users:\\n\\n- don\u2019t need to trust or rely on a centralized OSPNS for information.\\n- don\u2019t need to interact with applications unnecessarily and manually stay on stand-by for any activities they would like.\\n- can opt-in to information and alerts they find useful.\\n- can communicate with other accounts instead of operating in isolation.\\n- can automate messages that users and dapps care about.\\n- can expect a much better onboarding experience.\\n\\nEPNS enables open and direct peer-to-peer communication through an incentivization scheme without compromising communication or anonymity. Instead of app-to-client messaging, EPNS allows for wallet-to-wallet or service-to-wallet messaging both for on and off-chain events. As a result, end users have end-to-end visibility of transactions and on-chain events to generate awareness while increasing trust.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nGovernance mechanisms in web3 often lack good user experience as users must constantly check on and off-chain activity for recent updates and proposals. Or, users depend on the news efforts from individuals on the latest governance activity.\\n\\nIf, for instance, a user wants to keep informed and engaged with Uniswap\u2019s governance proposals, they have the overhead of constant engagement to not miss out on any activity.\\n\\n<i>With EPNS, that changes.</i><br/><br/>\\n\\nIntegrating EPNS with Uniswap allows users to receive notifications directly to their wallets whenever a new governance proposal is submitted, such as the recent governance proposal to [create the Uniswap Foundation](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/24?chain=mainnet), allowing users to stay up-to-date and never miss a vote.\\n\\n![Project](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nThis is what EPNS had the pleasure of doing in early 2021 \u2014 integrating with Uniswap to accelerate DeFi and the web3 experience. Learn more about the collaboration in [this blog post](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/accelerating-defi-with-epns-f2cbfaa33c91).\\n\\nThe information required to notify users about different web3 events is complex and requires massive infrastructure efforts, which is another reason EPNS started. EPNS is also a demonstration of how to scale services and implement solutions in a modular way, as developers can easily build dapps with EPNS. Before diving into the communication layer itself, including how communication channels and messaging work with EPNS, how the publish/subscribe model fits into web3, and understanding EPNS under the hood, we will attempt to make the case by using web3 push notifications for different use cases and the need for a web3 communication layer in Part 2.\\n\\n<i>By Danny Salman</i>"},{"id":"epns-monthly-blocks-august","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-monthly-blocks-august","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-05-epns-monthly-blocks-august/index.md","title":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","description":"Cover image of EPNS Monthly Blocks","date":"2022-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 5, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"}],"readingTime":2.6233333333333335,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-monthly-blocks-august","title":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"This August was definitely a wild ride and we couldn\u2019t have had more fun.\ud83c\udfa2 Let\u2019s take a look at all the happenings this month!","tags":["Newsletter","Epnsproject","Blockchain","Ethereum"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"\u2018My Dapp\u2019 Would Like to Send You Push Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/my-dapp-would-like-to-send-you-push-notifications"},"nextItem":{"title":"\u2018My App\u2019 Would Like to Send You Push Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/my-app-would-like-to-send-you-push-notifications"}},"content":"![Cover image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\x3c!--customheaderpoint--\x3e\\n\\n# August 2022<br/>\\n\\nThis August was definitely a wild ride and we couldn\u2019t have had more fun.\ud83c\udfa2 Let\u2019s take a look at all the happenings this month!\\n\\n![What\'s New](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n## Development \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\\n\\nThe Development team had a very busy and successful month.

The first push service was launched by Apple in June 2009, the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs). After that, Google followed with a service of their own, Google Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM). Both companies have led efforts to enhance the push notification technology to where it is today.\\n\\nPush notifications are a type of message that can be presented in an alert-based format, such as message alerts, pop-ups, and banners. They serve as a mechanism that informs users about all kinds of information. Today, push notifications have dynamic traits with app components directly built into the notification delivery scheme.\\n\\nBefore the implementation of push notifications, different methods were used to send messages to apps, like maintaining a permanent open TCP/IP connection to a web server to receive real-time notifications (isn\u2019t efficient and not practical for modern devices) and polling, which requires a real-time request to prompt a notification (polling follows the request/response model).\\n\\n## An Overview of Push Notifications\\n\\nMessages allow for the transferability of information over the internet and are integral to communication among networks. In traditional client-server models, there are two types of messages: requests and responses. Push notifications are a type of response message from the server side, known as a server push. The server push requires a network request and is often event-driven, as in, if event \u201cn\u201d happens, trigger a response that pushes message \u201cm\u201d to the client.\\n\\nThe majority of applications provide responses to the user based on the actions they take on the application. For instance, if a user tries to log into a social media account but enters the wrong credentials, the server may prompt a message \u201cser, wrong password, account locked forever.\u201d A notification example that shows asynchronous messaging is a user who has a sports app on their device and receives real-time game updates about professional sports games being played simultaneously.\\n\\n![Notification](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n### An example with Discord\\n\\nTake the case of using Discord to keep up with all of your favorite crypto projects. Assuming you have allowed for notifications (1,2) if someone from the [EPNS Discord](https://discord.gg/YVPB99F9W5) server sends a message to a channel (3), the Discord server informs the push server of the availability of the new message (4). The server uses a unique ID associated with your device to push the new message as a notification (5). The push mechanism is not used when the Discord app is open on your device, as messages are sent directly from Discord\u2019s server to your account. The way your device receives the notification in real-time is by retaining a single connection (like a WLAN connection) whenever you close Discord. This method is used as opposed to each app on your device having its own connection. Note: this is a simplified version of how notifications [can] work on Discord.\\n\\n![Architecture](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nTo receive server pushes, a client must first subscribe to information channels provided by the server. This requires permission on the client side. When subscribed to push notifications, a publisher can push information. This is known as the publish/subscriber model. In general, the publish/subscribe mechanism includes peers who congregate around a topic they are interested in which lives on a central server, and these peers are said to be subscribed to that topic. Whenever new content is available on one of the information channels, the server pushes that information out to the client. Typically, push notifications are pushed to a client app that a user is using from an application server. Server pushes work because of a continuously open connection between a client device or interface, and the push service. A server provided by the operating system developer acts as middleware between the service and the client device by curating the communication with the device. The device registers on the push server with a unique ID to send the right messages to the right device. Thus, push technology can be considered a type of communication protocol with a centralized service provider.\\n\\n## Push Notification Providers\\n\\nPush notification providers allow apps to send notifications to their users. This is where APNs and C2DM would fall under. As an app publisher, the app can easily send messages, and these messages take different forms. A push notification provider gives you a platform on which you can create, schedule, and deliver messages to users and allow apps to compose, target, and execute message campaigns. Today, push notifications are not only a way to provide information, but have become a standard for communication.\\n\\n## Using Push Notifications\\n\\nBeyond the examples we gave, push notifications have a ton of use cases and can certainly enhance application experience, engagement, and general communication. The obvious is that users can obtain information in real-time about [almost] anything. In general, apps can establish direct communication channels that operate in an asynchronous format, engage users with curated content, and drive application traffic, all while ensuring users are up-to-date and informed of future events/changes.\\n\\nOutside of messaging notifications, push notifications are often unfavorable based on their usage for marketing and advertising. The frequency of notifications is also challenging to figure out. In addition, knowledge resources and assets are completely controlled by service providers who have the ability to generate narratives; they are the source of truth for the messages that are pushed.\\n\\n## Next-generation Push Notifications\\n\\nHow do we take push technology to the next level? By taking the service away from the service provider; from client/server to peers. Peers can facilitate messages as they wish. There is more data integrity within the resources that are pushed to peers as the peers are able to control the data.\\n\\nMany networks are already building the next generation of the internet, aka web3. However, the user experience in web3 is still mediocre and lacks the characteristics of seamless interactions and communication as found in the current web model. Along with many yet-to-be components, there is a critical piece missing: notifications. Users using web3 applications are forced to manually keep up-to-date with everything they are interacting with, manually conduct activities on their account, and operate in isolation. Bringing push notifications to web3 not only addresses some of the current pitfalls of push notifications but fundamentally improves the web3 user experience to a level capable of bringing on mass adoption.\\n\\nIn the coming articles, we\u2019ll explore how push notifications fit in web3 and dive into the key concepts mentioned earlier.\\n\\n<i>By Danny Salman</i>"},{"id":"buid-ling-the-future-of-web3-communication-with-epns-at-eth-online-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/buid-ling-the-future-of-web3-communication-with-epns-at-eth-online-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-26-buid-ling-the-future-of-web3-communication/index.md","title":"BUIDLing the Future of Web3 Communication With EPNS at ETHOnline 2022","description":"Cover image of BUIDLing the Future of Web3 Communication With EPNS at ETHOnline 2022","date":"2022-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 26, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Hackathons","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/hackathons"},{"label":"Developer","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/developer"},{"label":"Push Notification","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-notification"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"}],"readingTime":2.41,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"buid-ling-the-future-of-web3-communication-with-epns-at-eth-online-2022","title":"BUIDLing the Future of Web3 Communication With EPNS at ETHOnline 2022","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.png","text":"One of the best things about web3 and hackathons is how unique ideas transform into something tangible and solve web3 challenges and problems.","tags":["Web3","Hackathons","Developer","Push Notification","Blockchain"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"\u2018My App\u2019 Would Like to Send You Push Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/my-app-would-like-to-send-you-push-notifications"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing SNS for Push Delivery Nodes \u2014 Quickest Way to Bootstrap Your Wallet, App, or Any Platform to Power Web3 Notifications, Chats & More","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/introducing-sns-for-push-nodes"}},"content":"import { ImageText, VideoContainer } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of BUIDLing the Future of Web3 Communication With EPNS at ETHOnline 2022](./cover-image.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\x3c!--customheaderpoint--\x3e\\n\\n# Get your creative juices flowing and create something new with EPNS at ETHGlobal\u2019s ETHOnline 2022 hackathon.\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfd7 BUILD with EPNS \u2014 Make Web3 Communication Seamless\\n\\nOne of the best things about web3 and hackathons is how unique ideas transform into something tangible and solve web3 challenges and problems.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve had this experience in our previous hackathons, and we take pride in being involved with builders who take some time out and build and code with some intensity to make great products in the web3 ecosystem.\\n\\n![Docusaurus Image](./image-1.jpeg)\\n<ImageText>Builders at ETHAmsterdam hackathon</ImageText>\\n\\nThe last hackathon at ETHNYC was <b>38 hours</b> of intense hacking and <b>22 builders</b> building some amazing web3 protocols on top of EPNS!

They allow any platform (whether centralized or decentralized) to receive communication from Push storage nodes, i.e., the nodes validating and indexing all communications and tying them to your wallet address (and multi-chain identity).\\n\\nAs a developer, you run them on your backend, and they ensure that you can connect your web2 infra to web3 communication, for example, when you want to extend communication a step further to web2 platform users apart from web3 wallet addresses. In essence, they enable:\\n\\n1. Mapping any device token or platform username of web2 that you want to relay to a specific web3 wallet address.\\n2. Utilize those mapping to send alerts to web2 or web2.5 platforms, extending push nodes\' communication outreach to any service running on any solution, whether centralized or decentralized.\\n\\nHere\u2019s an example, crypto wallet mobile apps, crypto wallet browser extensions, Telegram and Discord bots, email alerts, or anything in between.\\n\\n<blockquote><i>Listening to Push storage nodes or using their RPC endpoints / SDK is still the best solution for a pure web3 experience. But if you are a developer and want to extend these communications experience and bring it to a centralized platform, then Push delivery nodes are the way to go.</i></blockquote>\\n\\nThe delivery node solution is ideal for building the web3 stack (like running your own node). While delivering a node solution on our platform, we realized that there is another mid-solution, albeit a hosted one, that might eliminate most of the developers\u2019 effort and still give them the ability to achieve the desired result, aka Hosted SNS Module.\\n\\n#### Introducing Hosted SNS Module\\n\\n![First image of Introducing SNS for Push Delivery Nodes \u2014 Quickest Way to Bootstrap Your Wallet, App, or Any Platform to Power Web3 Notifications, Chats & More](./image-1.png)\\n<ImageText>Hosted SNS Module architecture</ImageText>\\n\\nHosted SNS Module is a mid-level solution that eliminates all the heavy load of running a node or syncing information and gives you webhooks that you implement to start receiving notifications, chats, or any other web3 communication in your software.\\n\\nIt works by writing all the user web3 wallet communication into Amazon SNS as a topic. You, as a developer, only need to subscribe to the topic to start receiving those notifications. This eliminates the majority of infra building on the developer side when they are trying to create a PoC out and ensures instant integration to web3 notifications.\\n\\n<blockquote><i>We understand that most developers want an ideal web3 solution from us, which is what the push delivery node will deliver. However, speaking with some of the devs and observing hosted solutions from The Graph and Lens Protocol made it clear that a web2.5 way needs to exist to ease a developer\u2019s burden while enabling web3 infra.</i></blockquote>\\n\\n### 3 Steps for Getting Started With Hosted SNS Module\\n\\nIntegrating the SNS module into your code takes less than 10 mins and contains just 3 steps:\\n\\n<b>Step 1</b>: Implement a webhook to listen to AWS SNS. Here\u2019s a boilerplate along with specs to get you npm installed and running: https://github.com/push-protocol/push-sns-boilerplate\\n\\n<b>Step 2</b>: You will need to open an endpoint either at a dedicated IP that listens to SNS or, if you are testing locally, have to expose the public endpoint for which tons of software is available.\\n\\n<b>Hint</b>: For testing locally, You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to expose the public endpoint. Using this with the boilerplate, then the port needs to be 6,000. The ngrok URL can is now the SNS endpoint required in step 3.\\n\\n<b>Step 3</b>: Once you set up this, you need to contact us by either shouting / tagging us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/YVPB99F9W5) \u2014 SNS channel or reaching out via the [contact form](https://epns.io/#contact). We need this step as the SNS module requires whitelisting.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a time-lapse of how everything works\u2026 see you on the other side \ud83d\ude03\\n\\n![Second image of Introducing SNS for Push Delivery Nodes \u2014 Quickest Way to Bootstrap Your Wallet, App, or Any Platform to Power Web3 Notifications, Chats & More](./image-2.gif)\\n<ImageText>How the SNS module works behind the scene, powered by EPNS</ImageText>\\n\\n#### Useful links:\\n\\n- EPNS SNS boilerplate specs\\n  https://github.com/push-protocol/push-sns-boilerplate\\n- Documentation: https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/receiving-notifications"},{"id":"fast-tracking-proposals-approved","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/fast-tracking-proposals-approved","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-17-fast-tracking-proposals-approved/index.md","title":"Fast-tracking Proposals, Approved!","description":"Cover image of Fast-tracking Proposals, Approved!","date":"2022-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 17, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Dao","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/dao"},{"label":"Governance","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/governance"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Communication","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/communication"}],"readingTime":1.4333333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"fast-tracking-proposals-approved","title":"Fast-tracking Proposals, Approved!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We are excited to announce that governance proposal PIP-08 \u2014 Fast-tracking of PIPs that get Immediate traction into Snapshot \u2014 was approved via governance voting by a vast majority of 1.2M PUSH in favor.","tags":["Dao","Governance","Web3","Ethereum","Communication"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Introducing SNS for Push Delivery Nodes \u2014 Quickest Way to Bootstrap Your Wallet, App, or Any Platform to Power Web3 Notifications, Chats & More","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/introducing-sns-for-push-nodes"},"nextItem":{"title":"Socket Integrates EPNS to Send Users Important Updates Through Push Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/socket-integrates-epns-to-send-users-important-updates-through-push-notifications"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of Fast-tracking Proposals, Approved!](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWe are excited to announce that governance proposal <b>PIP-08 \u2014 [Fast-tracking of PIPs that get Immediate traction into Snapshot](https://gov.epns.io/t/fast-tracking-of-pips-that-get-immediate-traction-into-snapshot/688)</b> \u2014 was [approved via governance voting](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth/proposal/0x957d3355d4f402bc6f509166726fd4f2823e04af915ee1f52a3d0eb16a22aead) by a vast majority of 1.2M PUSH in favor.\\n\\nApproval of PIPs can now take as low as five days depending on traction from the community and after meeting predefined criteria.

The PIP must receive at least 10 likes and 3 comments and be in this category for at least 5 days.\\n\\n<b>Voting Phase</b> \u2014 The proposal is voted on and passed or rejected. In this final stage, the PIP will be up for voting for 7 days.\\n\\nA PIP takes at least 17 days to pass through this method. And while effective, it might not be efficient enough in some cases where a proposal might receive immediate positive traction from the community.\\n\\nNow that <b>PIP-08 </b>is approved, the process can be significantly expedited once a proposal meets certain criteria, reducing its time for the approval to 5 days.\\n\\n## Here is how a PIP gets passed at full tilt via fast-tracking:\\n\\nStep 1: Post the draft proposal in the Governance Proposals section of the forum.\\n\\nStep 2: The proposal must receive a minimum of 7 likes and 5 comments in favor <b>in the first 48hrs of being added to the forum</b>.\\n\\nStep 3: The proposal will be assigned a PIP number in the discussion forum and be promoted to Snapshot, skipping the discussion phase.\\n\\nStep 4: Promote to Snapshot with immediate vote open for 3 days.\\n\\n### Important considerations to fast-track your proposals\\n\\n1.

While some offer the utmost decentralization, others are carved out for scalability, and then some are exclusively meant to support NFTs. The <b>growing number of blockchains</b> and their categorization isn\u2019t particularly a bad thing.\\n\\nHowever, blockchains, by design, cannot communicate with or read data from sources outside their own ecosystem. This results in many high-potential but segregated blockchain ecosystems, each having its own isolated set of applications, platforms, and users.\\n\\nAs a solution, we have projects working to address the lack of interoperability to help apps and users transfer data and value across different chains. One project that is leading the charge in interoperability is Socket. And we are thrilled to announce that EPNS is partnering with this innovative project to bring a decentralized push notification service to its users.\\n\\n## Where Does EPNS Fit Into Socket\u2019s Equation?\\n\\nSocket enables blockchain interoperability through its two key components:\\n\\n1. The Socket Liquidity Layer acts as a DEX aggregator and ensures users can easily transfer funds across blockchains as per their speed, fee, and security preferences.\\n\\n2. Socket Data Layer is a messaging layer that smart contracts and, thus, dapps hosted across blockchains can seamlessly interact and share data with each other.\\n\\nWith these two components, Socket offers developers the base infrastructure to build dapps that can operate across multiple chains. This also translates to the fact that users of the dapps using Socket\u2019s infra would be able to easily transfer value across chains. And this is where EPNS comes into the picture.\\n\\n<b>Socket will use EPNS to notify its dapp users whenever bridging between two chains is complete</b>. Further, users will have the option to get notified whenever the gas fees drop so they can execute their cross-chain transactions for the lowest possible fee.\\n\\nIt is a delight for us to be partnering with projects like Socket that are genuinely pushing the bars higher for interoperability standards. While we have kicked off this collaboration with two use cases, we are excited to explore more use cases as the platform develops and new possibilities come into the picture.\\n\\nStay tuned to keep updated on the most recent EPNS partnerships and developments around the decentralized push notification standards!\\n\\n### About Socket\\n\\n[Socket](https://socket.tech/) is an interoperability protocol for secure & efficient data and asset transfers across chains. Socket is not a bridge or a cross-chain app \u2014 it is an infrastructure that allows developers to build these things easily. Developers can use Socket to build apps with interoperability as a core part of app infrastructure.\\n\\n[Website](http://socket.tech/) | [Bungee](http://bungee.exchange/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SocketDotTech) | [Discord](https://t.co/Il4enrA7Lo)"},{"id":"vamos-latam-fam","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/vamos-latam-fam","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-10-vamos-latam-fam/index.md","title":"Vamos Latam Fam \ud83e\uddc9","description":"Cover Image of Vamos Latam Fam \ud83e\uddc9","date":"2022-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 10, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"}],"readingTime":2.033333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"vamos-latam-fam","title":"Vamos Latam Fam \ud83e\uddc9","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.jpeg","text":"We had a blast with our invitees during Friday PUSH #21 in preparation for ETH Latam \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83d\udc83.

These companies are in their initial stages and perpetually on the lookout for skilled professionals who can help realize their vision. As such, Cryptocurrency Jobs is the leading job board for the blockchain and crypto industries. The platform curates the best jobs at leading blockchain-based companies and startups to help professionals readily grab the opportunities at hand.\\n\\nToday, we at EPNS are proud to announce a strategic alliance with Cryptocurrency Jobs to enable direct communication between the platform and its users. By employing decentralized push notifications, this alliance will bring new job opportunities and updates to web3 professionals right on their devices.\\n\\n## Decentralized Push Notifications for Web3 Professionals\\n\\nCryptocurrency Jobs launched in 2017 and the platform firmly believes that the decentralized future is people-centric. In these five years, the platform has connected talented individuals with companies of every size. Now, with the rapid evolutions in the web3 space, web3 professionals and companies spend most of their time on decentralized applications. As such, Cryptocurrency Jobs can vastly benefit from a decentralized communication medium that directly connects the platform and professionals.\\n\\nThis is precisely where the collaboration with EPNS comes into play. As the decentralized communication medium for web3, we have created a channel for the Cryptocurrency Jobs platform.

This technology made it possible for a network of participants from different parts of the world to collaborate and run the blockchain network on their terms. All without the need for centralized authorities.\\n\\nHowever, the degree of decentralization of blockchain-based protocols is determined not just by their architecture but also by the way in which they are governed and operated. In this regard, DXdao is DeFi\u2019s super scalable collective that personifies decentralization. With an innovative suite of products, this protocol aims to provide decentralized governance solutions for DeFi protocols to help scale the DeFi industry as a whole. On this ambitious journey, we at EPNS are pleased to collaborate with DXdao to enable push notifications for Swapr Campaign updates and uphold the spirit of decentralization.\\n\\n### How DXdao Can Benefit From Push Notifications\\n\\nAs its name suggests, DXdao is a decentralized autonomous organization that is owned and operated by its community of users. It builds solutions for the development, growth, and governance of DeFi products, with a special emphasis on governance. It has an illustrious list of products that provide services ranging from automated market making and predictions to token launching and programmable incentives.\\n\\nDeFi protocols can integrate these products into their own platforms to create super scalable platforms. And, through one of its star products Swapr, DXdao provides a multi-chain AMM with a suite of unique features including LP governance, DIY farming, and much more. However, without the help of a reliable communication channel, it is difficult to keep users up to date with all events and news to maximize their participation in Swapr. This is where DXdao\u2019s integration of EPNS could be game-changing.\\n\\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our collaboration with DXdao, we aim to build a robust communication channel through which the network can keep its participants updated about all Swapr campaign events. Users can subscribe to the official channel on EPNS to receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- A campaign in Swapr is expired\\n- A new campaign is starting\\n\\nAs DXdao continues to revolutionize and fully decentralize the DeFi ecosystem, we are pleased to collaborate with them to ensure the greatest user experience for all participants. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of DXdao.\\n\\n### About DXdao\\n\\nDXdao is a decentralized collective that builds and governs DeFi products. DXdao was spawned in May 2019 through a collaboration between Gnosis and DAOstack. Reputation (REP) is voting power in DXdao, and DXD is the financial token with a claim on profit from DXdao products. Some of DXdao\u2019s products include [Omen](https://omen.eth.limo/) (permissionless prediction markets), [Swapr](https://swapr.eth.limo/) (governance-enabled AMM), [Carrot](https://carrot.eth.limo/) (programmable incentives), [Mesa](https://mesa.eth.limo/) (batch auction DEX), DXvote (DAO governance).

To ensure that, as you might know, we had approved Grants for some amazing projects via our [Push Grants Program](https://gov.epns.io/c/grants/10).\\n\\nTo top it all, what could be better than getting amazing participation from builders all around the World at ETH NewYork!\\n\\n## Highlights for the latest Q2 \u2014 2022\\n\\n- Starting with channels, the total number of live channels on EPNS has reached 74, a 45% increase from the previous quarter.\\n- Also, we witnessed ~16% growth in unique users and opt-ins across the platform.\\n- We have delivered over 11 million+ notifications to date, a 175% increase from 4 million notifications that were delivered till Q1 2022.\\n\\nThese were some sneak peeks of what happened in Q2 at EPNS, let\u2019s dive into details of how we achieved these numbers \ud83e\udd88\\n\\n## Development\\n\\nOur awesome team of builders has been hustling with the latest developments. And these updates are successfully echoing the EPNS mission of building <b>decentralized communications</b>.\\n\\nTake a look at the latest <b>Development Updates for Q2!</b>\\n\\n## Smart Contract V2 Development and Audit\\n\\nSmart Contracts V1.5 has now been developed completely. While we are working towards V2 of the contract, we decided to roll it out after V1.5 is launched. Some of the important features of EPNS Core V1.5 are:\\n\\n**Use of $PUSH token for Channel Creation:** EPNS Core Contract shall no longer require DAI tokens for channel creation. Instead, developers can now create Channels with a minimum deposit of 50 $PUSH tokens.\\n\\n<b>Claim Reward Function:</b> V1.5 of the EPNS Core Contract will include a function that allows $PUSH Holders to claim rewards from the contract.\\n\\n<b>Time-Bound Channels:</b> Special Channels that can be created for a specific time duration and will be destroyed upon expiry.\\n\\nSmart Contract V1.5 has already qualified for the initial security audit phase. After the final audit report, V1.5 of the EPNS contracts would be deployed on the <b>Ethereum Mainnet</b> and Testnets like <b>Kovan</b> and <b>Ropsten.</b>\\n\\nA separate blog to provide detailed updates on V1.5 will be published soon.\\n\\n### Editing Channel Details Feature\\n\\nThis feature on the Frontend dapp allows Channels to edit or modify essential details like Logo, Description, and Channel Name. Once Smart Contract V1.5 is deployed on the Mainnet, this feature will be made live on Prod.\\n\\n## EPNS x The Graph Integration\\n\\nEver since launching, The Graph has been one of the key supporters of EPNS. To foster this relationship and our shared values of decentralization, we have announced EPNS Integration with Subgraphs hosted on The Graph Protocol.\\n\\nTo enable this, we have created special tooling for a Helper Function that allows you to <b>read events across the Subgraph</b> and generate <b>Notifications</b> accordingly. If you are a developer and want to:\\n\\n- Track volumes of NFT collections on <b>LooksRare</b>, or\\n- Access the data related to swaps and pairs on <b>Sushiswap</b>, or\\n- Get notified whenever a sale happens on <b>CryptoPunks</b>\\n\\nYou can accomplish all these and a lot more with the latest Subgraph integration. Here is an [example guide](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/examples/notification-via-subgraph-example) on sending notifications from Subgraphs.\\n\\n## Polygon Deployment\\n\\nWe have already deployed the EPNS Communicator contract on Polygon Mumbai Testnet as well as Mainnet. Imperative features like sending notifications on Polygon have now been developed, tested, and deployed in the Staging environment.\\n\\nThe UI/UX for the entire channel creation flow, specifically for Polygon, is currently under development and will soon be live on Prod.\\n\\n## Wallet to Wallet Chat\\n\\nWe initiated the building of our Wallet-to-Wallet Protocol: a cross-chain communication protocol that allows wallets to exchange messages between them.\\n\\nWe also started building the UI for the Chat App, which will interact with W2W Protocol. Our Push nodes have been extended to support this amazing new functionality.\\n\\n## Analytics Dashboard\\n\\nFrontend and majority of the APIs for analytics dashboard are ready. Backend for the dashboard is also progressing at a rapid speed. We will roll out the dashboard as soon as the APIs are live.\\n\\n## Some More Updates\\n\\nThere are some other equally significant tasks that we worked upon in this quarter.\\n\\nOur devs extensively worked on standardization of the channel and notification payloads. The architecture for <b>Decentralized Push Nodes</b> is progressing at a rapid speed as well. <b>Browser notifications</b> are live on Dev and Staging environments.\\n\\nAlso, added the <b>Notification Preview</b> feature into the Frontend dApp. We are working on a<b> Mono Repo for Developers</b>, which is in its final stages. Besides, the <b>Ledger integration</b> with EPNS will go live in Q3.\\n\\n<b>Channel notifications</b> settings and <b>advanced search</b> are underway and will be deployed once the crucial updates for Smart Contract goes live.\\n\\n### Collaborations\\n\\nWe are building for the community, and bridging the communication gap between Web3 services and users is our mission. To enable this change, EPNS partnered with 21 amazing new dApps in Q2, a staggering 131% increase from the previous quarter.

It also helps us receive genuine product feedback, as well as create brand exposure.\\n\\n![Hackathons Image](./image-3.webp)\\n\\nIn the last three months, we have sponsored four major global hackathons at ETH Amsterdam, HackMoney\u201922, Graph Hack, and ETH New York, and supported 150+ hackers and builders. These events were some awe-inspiring moments where we met amazing teams building with EPNS. Across all these events, over 50 projects integrated EPNS for a combined prize pool worth $16,000.\\n\\nApart from supporting the builders across multiple ecosystems, we also hosted an in-house HackSprint. It was a 2-Day virtual workshop for developers to Learn and Integrate EPNS into their dApps.\\n\\n### Featured\\n\\nApart from achieving a majority of the roadmap goals, our team proudly represented EPNS on the Global stage at numerous events.

As such, Polychain Monsters will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their various activities in the rapidly expanding \u201cPolyverse\u201d.\\n\\n## Polychain Monsters: The Cross-Chain Collectible Ecosystem\\n\\nPolychain Monsters is an NFT project that aims to build a cross-chain digital collectible and gaming experience. At the very core of this project are Polymon, intricately designed and animated NFTs which can be unpacked in digital booster packs using $PMON tokens. These booster packs are available on the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon networks, in addition to a one-off 10k Solana drop featuring Polychain Monsters\u2019 latest expansion \u2014 Exomon. Each booster pack includes three Polymon, which come in a variety of traits that define their rarity. Some combinations of traits are extremely rare and valuable, and have sold on secondaries for over $100,000.\\n\\nPolymon holders can earn weekly rewards by staking their NFTs or participating in yield farming using $PMON tokens. These Polymon will eventually play a crucial part in multiple play-and-earn games that are currently being developed within the Polychain ecosystem. As such, this project can significantly benefit from a decentralized communication channel that updates its users every time a new booster pack is available or when their rewards are deployed. This is where the alliance with EPNS comes into play.\\n\\n## What Does the Collaboration Entail?\\n\\nThe main aim of our collaboration with Polychain Monsters is the creation of a decentralized communication channel that enables direct communication between users and the platform. This channel will be housed on EPNS and users of Polychain Monsters can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications whenever:\\n\\n- Their rewards are sent\\n- They pulled a rare Polymon\\n- Other incoming features to be revealed\\n  This saves users from manually checking for updates, making the platform easy to use. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to strike this alliance with Polychain Monsters and hope to become an integral part of their operations.\\n\\n### About Polychain Monsters\\n\\nPolychain Monsters are beautifully animated cross-chain NFTs with varying scarcity, waiting to be discovered in digital booster packs. These NFTs will play an integral part in upcoming off- and on-chain games. In addition, Polychain Monsters offers DeFi features such as ERC-20 & BEP-20 PMON, as well as NFT staking.\\n\\nStay in touch!

They allow businesses to collaborate on project planning, resource allocation, and performance monitoring. The tools also provide the ability to establish a pyramid of tasks for effective completion.\\n\\nHowever, the popular project management tools of today are centralized and more suited for web2 projects. The decentralized web3 community that is now swarming with innovative projects, needs a decentralized project management tool and Wonderverse fills this gap. It is a web3 project management platform that allows DAOs to manage and track their workflows. From allocating tasks to managing resources and people, Wonderverse is a one-stop-shop for all things DAO management.\\n\\nThe past part is that it integrates crypto into project management, allowing users to pay and get paid in cryptocurrencies. With Wonderverse, web3 projects can do away with web2 project management tools and get the full web3 experience. In this regard, Wonderverse needs a communication medium that coordinates interactions between users and the platform. This is where the collaboration with EPNS is crucial.\\n\\n## What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThe main aim of our collaboration with Wonderverse is the creation of a decentralized communication channel that enables direct communication between users and the platform. This channel will be housed on EPNS and users of Wonderverse can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- A new task is assigned\\n- Due dates for a task are approaching/reached\\n  This saves users from manually checking for updates, making the platform easy to use. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a DAPP, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to strike this collaboration with Wonderverse and hope to become an integral part of their operations.\\n\\n## About Wonderverse\\n\\nWonderverse is a DAO native tool that combines critical pieces to manage participation in a DAO. Primarily a project management tool integrated into crypto, it strives to be a one-stop-shop for all things DAO participation.\\n\\nStay in touch!

User data is exploited and used to serve personalized ads to people with all the financial rewards going only to the businesses. Now, Quest3 is a web3 platform that aims to solve this problem and ensures that users are rewarded for their time.\\n\\nAdvertisements on this platform are presented in a gamified manner. Users receive advertisements while actively completing quests and earning rewards. The rewards include crypto tokens and NFT badges that hold real monetary value. This way of serving advertisements to users is beneficial for both businesses and users, allowing all players to benefit from the ordeal.\\n\\nIn this regard, Quest3 needs a communication channel that allows the platform to directly send notifications whenever new quests are available. This is where the collaboration with EPNS comes into play.\\n\\n### What does the Collaboration entail\\n\\nAs a result of the pilot collaboration between EPNS and Quest3, Quest3 will have an official channel on the EPNS platform that its users can subscribe to. In doing so, they will receive decentralized push notifications directly from the platform informing them about various happenings on the platform. Users can expect to receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- A new quest starts\\n- A quest is about to end (in X days)\\n- A quest ends\\n  This allows the users to take full advantage of the opportunities as and when they arise. EPNS has a chrome extension along with a mobile application and a decentralized application to ensure that users don\u2019t miss out on important notifications.\\n\\nAs Quest3 is working towards an open web infrastructure, we at EPNS are pleased to partner with them and hope to become an integral part of their operations.\\n\\n### About Quest3\\n\\nQuest3 is a Web3 quest and event platform incubated by [Hogwarts Labs](https://twitter.com/HogwartsLabs). Users can earn tokens and NFT badges by participating in quests and events. Quest3 is committed to providing a variety of permissionless on-chain and off-chain quests for GameFi, DAOs, communities and other projects, benefiting users continuously, flourishing the propagation ecosystem and realizing Web3 native value delivery.\\n\\nStay in touch!

As such, Sturdy will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their loans and high-yielding opportunities on the platform.\\n\\n### Bringing Interest-Free Lending to DeFi\\n\\nDeFi\u2019s lending and borrowing protocols played a pivotal role in the industry\u2019s rise, bringing millions into the decentralized realm. However, in the present scenario, borrowers are required to pay heavy interests for their loans along with over-collateralizing for the same. In this regard, Sturdy is the one of the kind of DeFi protocol that facilitates interest free borrowing for users.\\n\\nThe protocol utilizes the borrowers\u2019 collateralized assets in a smart way by staking them with protocols like Yearn, Convex, and Lido. Then, the interest generated by these assets is used to pay interest to the lenders. This means that while borrowers can take advantage of interest-free loans, lenders can still make high yields and profits by lending on Sturdy.\\n\\nWith a truly novel approach to lending and borrowing, Sturdy is poised to bring in a new wave of users into DeFi. As such, the protocol can benefit from a decentralized communication channel that allows seamless interaction with its users. This is where the collaboration with EPNS comes into play.\\n\\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThe collaboration between EPNS and Sturdy aims to create a direct communication channel between the users and the protocol for seamless interaction. This channel is housed on the EPNS platform where users of Sturdy can easily subscribe to it. Subscribers will receive decentralized push notifications from the platform whenever\\n\\n- Their loans approach liquidation\\n- There are high APY opportunities available on the platform\\n  This allows users to take prompt action and grab the opportunities on time. Moreover, these notifications also save users from the hassle of manually checking for all these updates and improves the user experience on the platform along with the participation rates. EPNS has a chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application to ensure users never miss out on these notifications.\\n\\nWe at EPNS are excited to dive into this alliance with Sturdy and hope to contribute to the growth of the platform.\\n\\n### About Sturdy\\n\\nSturdy is a first of its kind of DeFi lending protocol offering interest-free borrowing and high yield lending. Users can interact with the protocol in two ways: as \u2018borrowers\u2019 who take out loans and provide collateral or as \u2018lenders\u2019 who earn yield on their assets.\\n\\nBorrowers pay no interest, withdrawal fees, or deposit fees. Instead, their collateral is staked, and the yield from their staked collateral is used to provide interest to lenders. Lenders benefit from interest rates that are higher and more consistent than a money market where borrowers pay a variable APY.\\n\\nTo ensure that you don\u2019t miss out on the latest developments, stay connected with Sturdy on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SturdyFinance), [Medium](https://sturdyfinance.medium.com/), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/tRVHp6Vx5N)."},{"id":"epns-monthly-blocks","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-monthly-blocks","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-05-epns-monthly-blocks/index.md","title":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","description":"Cover image of EPNS Monthly Blocks","date":"2022-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 5, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"}],"readingTime":2.7466666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-monthly-blocks","title":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We made it to a wonderful end of Q2!

As such, Pine will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their loans on the platform.\\n\\n### NFT Backed Lending\\n\\nPine is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol in DeFi that allows users to borrow funds against their NFTs. Now, the NFT industry is one of the fastest-growing and most valuable in the world, with a market value of more than $40 billion. In the beginning, digital artists sold individual pieces of art as NFTs. And now, it\u2019s a field with thousands of projects that could change the way the world\u2019s biggest industries work. With an increase in utility, the net value of this asset class has increased exponentially with some NFTs going in the millions.\\n\\nAs such, NFT investments make for good collateral and Pine aims to bring this convenience to investors. The platform provides permissionless, instant loan transactions that evade the need for negotiations. The NFTs are valuated in real-time to ensure that both the borrower and the lender get a fair deal on the loan. Once the NFT is locked as collateral, borrowers can receive the loan amount in a cryptocurrency of their choice, even if it is different from the NFTs native chain.\\n\\nIn this regard, Pine can benefit from a decentralized communication medium that keeps users updated about the status of their loans.\\n\\n### What Does the Alliance Entail\\n\\nAs a result of our pilot collaboration with the platform, Pine will have an official channel on the EPNS platform. Users who choose to subscribe to this channel, are directly connected for seamless communication with the platform in a decentralized manner. They can expect to receive notifications like\\n\\n- Loan Liquidation alerts\\n- Loan about to expire alerts\\n  These notifications save users time and efforts of manually checking for loan updates and helps them take the right action on time. With a chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application, EPNS ensures that notifications are delivered to all devices and are not missed.\\n\\nAs Pine continues to revolutionize the DeFi lending space, we are pleased to collaborate with them to ensure the smooth running of their processes. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of the Pine Protocol.\\n\\n### About Pine\\n\\nPine Protocol is a lending and borrowing protocol built on multiple blockchains to facilitate on-chain asset-backed financing. As a two-sided protocol, Pine allows borrowers to use their assets, represented on-chain via NFTs, as collaterals to borrow cryptocurrencies from lenders in real-time, in a fair, transparent, and efficient way. Pine is built by a team of NFT lovers who come from diverse backgrounds in blockchain engineering, investment banking, and management consulting.\\n\\nStay in touch!

Dive into the details and buckle up!\\n\\nA year ago, we announced the [first volume](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf) of Push (prev EPNS) #ROCKSTARS on the heels of our IDOs. Each week for the following 52 weeks, we asked our community to participate in a small challenge. Meme competitions, explainers, tutorials, guides, threads, and more. You name it \u2014 the community came together and created it. Each week, the winner of that competition was gifted 2,400 PUSH and one Rockstar NFT, each of which was designed by an Indian artist.\\n\\n#### Today, we\u2019re excited to kick off the second volume of Push Rockstars!\\n\\n![Second volume of Push Rockstars Image](./image-1.webp)\\n<ImageText>Contribute to WIN 900 PUSH & an NFT</ImageText>\\n\\nFollowing the drop rules of [Rockstars of Push (prev EPNS) Volume 1](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf), We\u2019ll be distributing one NFT a week (every Monday for the next 100 weeks \ud83d\ude31) to one community member who does something to help us push the envelope forward.\\n\\nSo what are some ideas for you to get Volume 2 drops? Well, in no particular order, here are some things community members have done for us in the past which we love \ud83d\udc96\\n\\n- Development blogs, workshops, explanations or any #buidl related things, the more creative it gets, the better\\n- Provided PRs for improvements on several of our SDKs / Frontend / Repos: https://github.com/push-protocol\\n- Written a blog post explaining an element of the protocol or token design very clearly \ud83e\udd13\\n- Created some killer memes about Push Protocol & push notifications for web3 \ud83d\udcaa\\n- Or do anything which you have a knack for whether it\u2019s getting people to build with Push, explanations, content, design, tweet threads, or whatever\\n\\n### Rules for Participation?\\n\\nThe best way is to follow Push Protocol on [Twitter](https://x.com/PushChain) and join [Discord](https://discord.gg/YVPB99F9W5) to stay up to date when we announce each weekly competition. Every entry that tags [@PushChain](https://x.com/PushChain) and uses #Rockstars will be considered. Being active on Discord and gathering community love will play a role in nominations though winners (as always) will be decided through governance. Top-notch entries (even in earlier weeks) will be eligible in rolling weeks and sometimes the Push team will try to spruce things up sometimes with some cool creative weekly contests so do keep an eye out on our Twitter handle!\\n\\nRock on and join the Push community! \ud83d\udd14\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\udd1d\u200d\ud83e\uddd1"},{"id":"eth-new-york-buidl-the-future-of-web3-comm-with-epns","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/eth-new-york-buidl-the-future-of-web3-comm-with-epns","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-24-eth-new-york-buidl-the-future/index.md","title":"ETHNewYork: BUIDL the future of Web3 comm with EPNS \ud83d\uddfd\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd14","description":"Cover image of ETHNewYork: BUIDL the future of Web3 comm with EPNS \ud83d\uddfd\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd14","date":"2022-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 24, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Hacking","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/hacking"},{"label":"Cryptocurrency","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/cryptocurrency"},{"label":"Software Development","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/software-development"}],"readingTime":4.683333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"eth-new-york-buidl-the-future-of-web3-comm-with-epns","title":"ETHNewYork: BUIDL the future of Web3 comm with EPNS \ud83d\uddfd\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd14","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"It feels so great to be here in NYC!

Solve. Conquer.\\n\\nFor those who\u2019d prefer to go the reading way here\u2019s how you can Buidl. Solve. Conquer this weekend!\\n\\nAs the blockchain ecosystem has evolved into a composable, multi-chain network, native Web3 communication is growing more and more necessary for user experience, developer operations, investor security, protocol architecture, and a lot more.\\n\\nToday\u2019s methods of communication between and among Web3 users and companies \u2014 dominated by Twitter, Discord, and Telegram \u2014 give rise to poor UX, scams, and sub optimal communication. Among some of the most pressing issues: smart contract version releases are missed, liquidation thresholds are not warned, NFT drops are forgotten, and vulnerabilities aren\u2019t communicated well.\\n\\nThe result is a fractured and siloed approach towards communication in the blockchain ecosystem, making room for an optimised, Web3-native solution. EPNS is created to fix this! This is how:\\n\\nIntegrate EPNS to your dApp and improve UX for all Web3 users\\n\\n- This is probably the easiest, As EPNS is a communication layer, the best and quickest way to get this going is to integrate EPNS in your dApp via our frontend sdk & tutorial here\\n- This will not only improve the user experience for your dApp as users can now instantly see all their notifications across all their activities that they have opted in for but it also vastly improves the entire UX of the Web3 space.\\n\\n<b><i>Screen1- User is connected to their wallet and has loaded their dApp.</i></b>\\n\\n![Screen1- User is connected to their wallet and has loaded their dApp Image](./image-2.png)\\n\\n<b><i>Screen2 \u2014 User sees the EPNS notifications if they are subscribed to any channels in a sidebar which comes on the click on the bell icon.</i></b>\\n\\n![Screen2 \u2014 User sees the EPNS notifications if they are subscribed to any channels in a sidebar Image](./image-3.png)\\n<b>Create your dApp / protocol channel and send notifs</b>\\n\\n- So, you already integrated EPNS but like to also improve the experience for your users. Well, this is where you can jump in and create your own channel (any service that sends notifications are called channels).\\n- After which you can easily start sending important notifications about your project directly to the wallet address in a gasless way.\\n- Whether you are creating DAO, DeFi, NFT, Metaverse or anything in between, having a direct form of communication tied to user\u2019s wallet address massively improves the experience of your dApp (and goes extremely well with the bell icon you have integrated)\\n\\n<b>Check out our <a href=\'/docs/notifications/showrunners-scaffold/get-started\'>Showrunners</a> and <a href=\'https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/examples/showrunners-example\'>Tutorials</a> here for more details</b>\\n\\n<b>Create notifications channel for anything Web3</b>\\n\\n- A lot of projects and protocols are popular but still don\u2019t have notifications, you can build notifications for them, not only you get prizes for it but some amazing incentives are coming for the channels that are popular (though this is a different conversation). Some ideas that you can use if you want to build out a notif channel.\\n\\n<b>Web3Comm for DeFi</b>\\n\\nThe DeFi ecosystem is a landscape of constant innovation. We have seen an unprecedented amount of on-chain activity, prompting acute needs from users to keep on top of what is happening. EPNS is poised to accelerate the adoption of the DeFi ecosystem to meet the needs of users and dapps to keep up with rapid innovation.\\n\\nThis of course is one while most important we\u2019ve made quite a headway with a bunch of partners, however if you think you are able to renovate some of this, and build your own technology and have protocols that change the DeFi space for the better, we\u2019d definitely invite you to explore this side of things. Some of the things that EPNS can enable for DeFI protocols and their users is to solve critical DeFi problems as below..\\n\\n- Near Liquidation Alert (Borrowers & Liquidators)\\n- Staking Rewards Available to Claim (Stakers)\\n- Staking Rewards About to Expire (Stakers)\\n- Price Alerts (Traders)\\n- Stablecoin Peg Slippage (Arbitrageurs)\\n- Low Gas Cost (Devs, ETH Power Users)\\n- Rebalances (Token Set Users)\\n- Index Selection/Weighting Changes (Index Users)\\n- Token/Contract Migrations (Protocol Users)\\n- Governance Updates, Token Launches\\n- New Collateral Types on Money Markets\\n- New Liquidity Mining Incentives\\n- Yield Farming APY alerts\\n- Escrow Periods Ending / Tokens Coming Unlocked\\n\\nBesides these there are a ton of other applications that\u2019ll most Web3 users in terms of getting communication or help on notification for that are of important notifications across the board.\\n\\nHope these ideas are some that you find exciting to build, and if you do have any queries feel free to reach out to us on Twitter @epnsproject\\n\\n### \u260e\ufe0f Who do we reach out to for assistance?\\n\\nFeel free to reach out to us at <b>ETHNewYork</b>, our Co-Founder Richa and the EPNS team will be at the venue till the end of the hackathon.

However, the platform focuses on web3, allowing users to invest in and track their crypto and NFT portfolios. Investors can automatically import their Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) trades onto the Stox platform. They can also record any transaction done on the platform.\\n\\nA platform like this allows users to bring all of their under a single roof, making it easier for them to track, manage, and make adjustments to their portfolio. Stox has a beginner-friendly user interface with widgets and hashtags for quick glances. The best part is that Stox supports NFT investments and allows users to buy and sell NFTs on the platform.\\n\\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThe goal of our collaboration with Stox is the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows direct interaction with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and users of Stox can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications whenever one of their NFTs is sold.\\n\\nThis saves users from having to manually check for all of these updates, which makes the platform easier to use and increases the number of people who use it. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a DAPP, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to strike this alliance with Stox and hope to become an integral part of their operations.\\n\\n### About Stox\\n\\nStox is a global all asset investment tracker with a strong focus on web3 and social investing, for the masses\\n\\nStay in touch!

Although, with increased demand and users, comes the need for better user experiences and communication between protocols and its users.\\n\\n### A Need for a Better Solution for Web3 Communication\\n\\nThe current state of web3 social media and NFT marketplaces are reliant on web2 based centralized platforms in order to communicate with their users. This usually means one would need to dox their email, or any other personal handle in order to stay connected and updated about the state of their profile. One needs to reveal more than their wallet address in order to receive updates on the platform, or else they need to actively login to the platform in order to receive updates. In a world where users are accustomed to having information right at their fingertips, this is cumbersome and inefficient. Such a user flow is akin to that of the early 2000s when emails and early social media expected users to keep refreshing their pages to check if they have any updates. That is, until push notifications arrived.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/petrdu/status/1486059854137643008&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"849\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"petrduda.eth \ud83d\udcaf on Twitter: &quot;Houston, we have a problem. @BudweiserUSA introduced me to @Sanchezsammyy with an #NFT drop.

The value of platform-to-user communication and vice versa is crucial to cultivating user retention in the long term.\\n\\nSuch a communication layer has been lacking in web3 for a long time, that is until EPNS arrived. EPNS is a decentralized communication layer for the Web3 ecosystem. It allows any dApp, protocol, or smart contract to send send communication (starting with on chain / off chain / gasless notifs) tied to user wallet addresses in an open, gasless, multichain and platform agnostic fashion. This allows users to receive updates in real-time without revealing more than their wallet address connected to their favorite platforms and protocols.\\n\\nLet us explore some of the ways web3 social media platforms and NFT marketplaces can leverage EPNS to effectively communicate with their users:\\n\\n### NFT Trading (Buy, Sell, Auction, Offers)\\n\\nNFT Marketplaces need to communicate with their users when one\u2019s NFT has received an offer or got sold. This sort of communication is crucial for a trader\u2019s user experience in a marketplace.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/opensea/status/1534957511777914881&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"983\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"OpenSea on Twitter: &quot;New drop from @playSHRAPNEL goes live at 1pm PST \ud83d\udc40check out the deets below \u21af https://t.co/qYpiJzAsXe / Twitter&quot;\\" class=\\"ek n fc dx bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\n\\nThe idea is to bring notifications to users when activities happen on the marketplace. For example, an NFT is bought or sold, or even when someone has put up an offer for it. The need for realtime notifications also arise during NFT auctions where time is of the essence in most cases. Notifications allow NFT traders to know if they either won an auction or if they got outbid, this allows them to make educated decisions and be on top of the situation.\\n\\nPopular NFT activities can also be monitored by tracking its on-chain movement and notifying interested users, this allows users to create watchlists for NFTs they are eyeing for when they are put for sale or for any other reason.\\n\\n### Artist drops and New Project Launches\\n\\nWith new projects and celebrity and artist drops happening every day, it is hard to keep track of what is happening and when. With the help of EPNS, fans can finally get notified when their favorite artist is about to drop their next collection, or if a new promising project goes live. Users can follow these creators and be notified of news that could be interesting to them.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/beeple/status/1536413438347460616&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"753\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"beeple on Twitter: &quot;ART BASEL pic.twitter.com/uUDllQyFZf / Twitter&quot;\\" class=\\"ek n fc dx bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\n\\n### NFT\u2019s are GOOD!\\n\\nSome projects are more than just being a marketplace, like [DoinGud](https://twitter.com/DoinGudHQ), which is a social marketplace focused on inspiring creativity and positive social impact.\\n\\nSpeaking of creators, there\u2019s a great project we are collaborating up with which is celebrating Manga culture and OG NFTs being the first platformless P2E called [CryptoMangaNFT](https://twitter.com/CryptoMangaNFT)\\n\\nAnd then of course we have your most famous [ENS domains](https://twitter.com/ensdomains), which also are your own NFTs! And with most domains, you\u2019d know they become priceless especially if they\u2019re unique and in the Web3 world in the future, those domain names for your wallet will become all the more important if they\u2019re unique! Having said that, you might forget when they expire, given that most folks buy it for extended periods.\\n\\nAlways good to be notified about that right? Given the value? We have built an ENS domain expiration channel that can notify users when their ENS domain is about to expire, so you never miss out on your domain name. To subscribe to the ENS channel head to [app.epns.io](http://app.epns.io/) and opt-in.\\n\\n![ENS Notification in Dapp Image](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n### The Social Network for NFTs (chat, like, share, comments)\\n\\nAs the NFT ecosystem explodes, complimentary NFT platforms are gaining traction. These platforms can help users explore new NFTs, connect communities, measure social engagement in a decentralized manner, platforms like Lenster, TryShowtime.\\n\\nThe current state of web3 social media is still evolving and EPNS is the perfect solution that allows for protocol to user communication in a decentralized manner. With EPNS, an on-chain or off-chain action can be used to trigger a notification, and hence be able to disperse information to the concerned people right at their fingertips. EPNS soon to be launched wallet to wallet chat will be an interesting addition to the social lego for creator economy \u2014 connecting buyers- sellers, group messaging, artist- fans, and even platform-to-user and vice versa communication such as customer care services, etc.\\n\\nNFTVerse is still an early market, but there is a significant opportunity for native communication to accelerate the adoption."},{"id":"epns-and-h20-ally","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-and-h20-ally","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-06-epns-and-h20-ally/index.md","title":"EPNS and H2O Ally to Enable Seamless Communication for Users","description":"EPNS and H2O Ally to Enable Seamless Communication for Users","date":"2022-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 6, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Defi","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/defi"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"}],"readingTime":1.4466666666666668,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-and-h20-ally","title":"EPNS and H2O Ally to Enable Seamless Communication for Users","description":"EPNS and H2O Ally to Enable Seamless Communication for Users","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"EPNS and H2O collaborate to bring decentralized push notifications to the platform.","tags":["Defi","Ethereum","Blockchain","Epnsproject"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why Engaging with Users Within the NFTVerse Matters","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/why-engaging-with-users-within-the-nft-verse-matters"},"nextItem":{"title":"EPNS x The Graph: Enabling a better way to access blockchain data \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udd14","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-x-the-graph"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of EPNS and H2O Ally to Enable Seamless Communication for Users](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nEPNS and H2O, the stable asset that allows users to transact in Ocean\u2019s decentralized marketplace, team up in a pilot collaboration to enable communication between the users and the platform. Users of H20 are now poised to receive updates whenever their loans approach liquidation.\\n\\n### A Stable Asset for the Data Market\\n\\nLaunched in March 2022, H2O is a non-pegged stable asset backed by Ocean Protocol\u2019s $OCEAN token. Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform that allows users to exchange valuable data in a safe and secure environment while maintaining privacy and control. The platform has two unique crypto primitives, on-ramp data and off-ramp data that allow users to tokenize their data.\\n\\nThey can then trade or exchange the data with companies and protocols of their choice. Ocean Protocol powers data markets that can act as bridges between DeFi protocols and data owners, facilitating the selling, buying, and even staking of data. In this regard, H2O is an asset that allows users to easily transact in these data markets, circumventing the volatility of the $OCEAN token. It serves as a stable unit of exchange. Users can simply deposit $OCEAN tokens and borrow H2O tokens for these transactions.\\n\\nAs such, there is a need for a robust communication mechanism that informs users when the price of $OCEAN falls below a certain threshold and their loan approaches liquidation. At EPNS, we aim to build this communication mechanism.\\n\\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nAs a result of our pilot collaboration with the platform, H2O will have an official channel on the EPNS platform. Users who choose to subscribe to this channel, are directly connected for seamless communication with the platform. They can expect to receive notifications whenever their loans approach liquidation. This allows users to take appropriate action on time, protecting their assets from liquidation.\\n\\nWith a chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application, EPNS ensures that notifications are delivered to all devices and are not missed. As H2O and Ocean Protocol continue to revolutionize the DeFi industry, we are pleased to collaborate with them to ensure the smooth running of their processes. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of the H2O platform.\\n\\nAbout H2O\\nH2O is a stable asset that allows users to transact freely in Ocean\u2019s decentralized data marketplace, removing the variability of OCEAN\u2019s pricing. Initially, OCEAN itself will back H2O; but the asset is poised to become data-backed later this year.\\n\\nStay in touch!

It allows any dapp, smart contract, backend or protocol to send communication directly to user wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion.\\n\\n#### About The Graph\\n\\nThe Graph is the indexing and query layer of web3. Developers build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL. Tens of thousands of developers use The Graph for applications such as Uniswap, Synthetix, KnownOrigin, Art Blocks, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Audius, Decentraland, and many others.\\n\\nNow, back to the <b>EPNS x The Graph</b> integration and how it helps. Until this integration, channel creators or developers have to:\\n\\n1. Create a channel, which is mandatory.\\n2. Once a channel is created, you will need to send out notifs, for which you have to set/define logics at the back end.\\n\\nTo send notifs on your channel, there were two methods which you can use:\\n\\n1. Using the backend SDK ([Showrunners Framework](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework-and-backend-sdk-beta-v1-0-are-live-7348c0725a12))\\n2. Using [smart contracts](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/examples/smart-contracts-example)\\n\\nHowever to do so, both methods required a decent amount of development work to code the logic using the SDKs.\\n\\nWith The Graph integration, you\u2019ll now be able to send EPNS notifications directly from your subgraph. With this new integration using the subgraph and EPNS, we are simplifying the process and minimising the need for extra development.\\n\\n![First image of EPNS x The Graph: Enabling a better way to access blockchain data \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udd14](./image-1.webp)\\n<ImageText>High level integration diagram</ImageText>\\n\\nTo expand on this, let\u2019s take a look at how this feature and integration is enabling a better way to access indexed data from the blockchain to send notifications.\\n\\n#### What does The Graph help with?\\n\\n- The biggest pain point you are able to address via The Graph is fetching data from the blockchain and customising it the way you want. Typically, if you were trying to do this directly from the blockchain, it would be very inefficient.\\n- There hasn\u2019t been a specific aggregator to check/run queries of all transactions in one place. And that\u2019s where The Graph comes in. Using a subgraph, you can define how you want to see your data, automatically indexing each block from the blockchain.\\n- Mainly querying data via a backend from the blockchain takes a lot of time and is a centralised approach, and that\u2019s something that subgraphs help with\\n- Subgraphs also have the ability to index different blockchains. Community members can directly query the data from the subgraph.\\n\\n#### Where does EPNS come in?\\n\\n- Using EPNS, developers can get notifications via their channels on EPNS, and get better access to the indexed data created via their subgraphs with this new integration.\\n- If your channel doesn\u2019t have a subgraph, you can first define that in a subgraph and then further use this new feature to send notifs as per your logic.\\n- Illustrating via an example, if you\u2019ve deployed a Uniswap contract and a swap\u2019s happening, then the developer can define an action as to what should happen if a swap event has happened. And accordingly push notifications for them.\\n- The integration eases the process, reduces the time of sending custom notifs by simply integrating the subgraph without the need of a server or spending too much time coding your own logic at the back end.\\n\\n#### Benefits of the EPNS x The Graph integration\\n\\n- With this integration, notifications can directly be triggered from a subgraph(see our [lightpaper](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ethereum-push-notification-service-litepaper-e7ca0a662862) for definitions of channels, services, and more)\\n- Developers can use all the power and flexibility of subgraphs and use that as the logic for their notifications.\\n\\nNote: Subgraph integration is available on staging right now.\\n\\n<blockquote><i>\\n\\nReal-time push notifications were for a long time a missing part in the web3 stack.

We created a very extensive and comprehensive documentation for developers, services, and end users. Additionally, we prepared a youtube playlist covering the many aspects of EPNS and its usage \u2014 [the EPNS 101 series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyWTqFLqKt9a2WVohtCzzsdo6GVpu1uTw). Make sure to check it out!\\n\\nMany other things worked this month are the result of feedback from the community and our collaborations, other things are us following our roadmap to ensure we achieve all our goals for this 2022. Some of the development efforts that took place this month are:\\n\\n- Tested and validation of sending Notifications through the Polygon network. Coming soon!!!\\n- Sign-in with multiple wallets in the mobile app finalized testing and its rolling out soon!\\n- Prod and Staging Browser extensions are live with fresh new look n\u2019 feel\\n- Currently working on a new type of secret notification\u2026 \ud83e\udd10\\n- EPNS Smart Contracts v2 in development with features like claiming of rewards, updating of channel details, and more!\\n- EPNS Analytics Dashboard, a one-stop-shop to showcase all crucial data points is in the works.\\n- One of the most awaited Showrunners channel is in the works! \u2014 The Wallet Tracker is coming very soon!\\n\\nAlso, we highly recommend this month that you read our blog on how EPNS aims to solve one of the significant challenges faced by DAO operations \u2014 Communication.

As such, Hermes DeFi will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the various investment and governance opportunities on the platform without reliance on Web2 social media platforms.\\n\\n#### Hermes DeFi: The Olympus of DeFi\\n\\nHermes DeFi defines itself as the \u201cOlympus of DeFi\u201d. With a team of 16 experienced DeFi users, Hermes is building an entire suite of DeFi applications surrounding a low-cost and efficient DEX/AMM on the Harmony blockchain. They have received almost $500,000 in investments from [Harmony](https://hermesdefi.medium.com/what-a-305k-investment-in-hermes-defi-looks-like-96b7bb4f534) and [Momentum 6](https://blog.hermesdefi.io/hermes-defi-receives-a-175-000-investment-for-their-trader-focused-dex-launching-on-harmony-9f25dd99b6f7) to build a trader-focused and user-friendly DeFi system on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/).\\n\\n<b>The Hermes Protocol</b> is a collection of DeFi tools that helps to bring ease of use and better insights into your crypto portfolio. On launch, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy a [0.2% swap fee](https://docs.hermesdefi.io/tokenomics/feenomics) with efficient routing across 13 tokens. Hermes is offering both regular Farms and [Dual Farms](https://docs.hermesdefi.io/partnerships/dual-farms), which can reward two tokens with no reward lockups. Farmed HRMS can be staked as [sHRMS](https://docs.hermesdefi.io/hermes-products/shrms) or [xHRMS](https://docs.hermesdefi.io/hermes-products/xhrms), which automatically collect a portion of protocol fees and payout in USDC or HRMS, respectively. These features, combined with an in-depth analytics system, are just the start for Hermes DeFi. Their [roadmap for 2022](https://docs.hermesdefi.io/the-hermes-protocol/roadmap) includes: trustless liquid staking of ONE tokens (hONE), Bonding, Limit Orders, and much more.\\n\\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nAs a result of this pilot collaboration, Hermes DeFi will have an official channel housed on the EPNS platform. Users of Hermes DeFi will be able to subscribe to this channel to receive:\\n\\n- Price alerts\\n- Updates about new bond cycles, new dual farms opening or dual farms closing\\n- Updates about governance proposals\\n- Notifications about reward thresholds when they are ready to claim.\\n- \u2026and more in the future!\\n\\nThis saves users the hassle of manually checking for all these updates and improves the user experience on the platform along with the participation rates. We\u2019re excited to dive into this alliance with Hermes DeFi and hope to contribute to the growth of the platform.\\n\\nAbout Hermes DeFi\\nHermes DeFi is the Olympus of Defi.

According to a [report by Kraken](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/kfzxp6qqaqnqyue6), as of February 2022, there are at least 188 DAOs controlling over $12 billion in assets. With such a mammoth amount of funds in DAO treasuries, there is also an overwhelming increase in the importance and management of DAO operations, as proven by the numbers (6.8K Snapshot spaces, 700K+ governance token holders). This opens up a door to build and create value in all the operational wings of this new era of digitally-native internet collective organizations.\\n\\nAlthough there is an increase in demand for robust DAO tooling, most of the space is still budding and isn\u2019t as streamlined as one would hope for it to be. EPNS aims to solve one of the significant challenges faced by DAO operations \u2014 <b>communication.</b>\\n\\nThe communication layer in web3 is often overlooked by many, even in DAOs. This eventually leads to slower workflows, inefficient processes, etc. among members, and often leads to going back to the reliance on centralized web2 services for communication such as Twitter and Discord.\\n\\n### What is a DAO?\\n\\nA DAO is an internet-native collective that comes together for a common purpose. They have a lower barrier to entry to coordinate assets and ideas compared to traditional organizations and they have no single person or group that controls the decisions of the entity\u2019s operations.\\n\\nAlthough there are many types of DAOs out there these days, most of them fall under the following categories: to build products (<a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://yearn.finance/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">yearn</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://sushi.com/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Sushi</a>), to invest (<a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://www.thelao.io/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The LAO</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://metacartel.xyz/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MetaCartel Ventures</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://www.bitdao.io/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">BitDAO</a>), to collect NFTs (<a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://flamingodao.xyz/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">FlamingoDAO</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://pleasr.org/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">PleasrDAO</a>), Protocol DAOS (<a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://makerdao.com/en/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Maker</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://compound.finance/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Compound</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://uniswap.org/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">UniSwap</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://aave.com/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Aave</a> &amp; <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://epns.io/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">EPNS</a> too), DAO Operating Systems( <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://aragon.org/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Aragon</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://daostack.io/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">DAOStack</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://www.orcaprotocol.org/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Orca</a>), Social DAOs (<a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://radicle.xyz/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Radicle</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://www.seedclub.xyz/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Seed Club</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://www.fwb.help/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">FWB</a>) or to provide services (<a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://www.raidguild.org/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">RaidGuild</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://www.lexdao.coop/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">LexDAO</a>, <a class=\\"af no\\" href=\\"https://www.metafactory.ai/\\" rel=\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Metafactory</a>).\\n\\n### Solving Challenges in DAO Ops\\n\\nNo matter the sector these DAOs are focusing on, operations & communication are a mammoth task when you have thousands of members scattered across the globe. EPNS solves some of the major challenges in communications faced by DAOs through its decentralized web3 communication layer. Let us explore some of the possible use cases below.\\n\\n#### Contribution Management:\\n\\nDAOs have contributors who contribute to the DAO in various degrees. The journey of a contributor is hard to track and navigate. For a new member, this journey would be to navigate through the DAO and find a task they can assign themselves and make their first contribution to the DAO.\\n\\nBounties and Quests act as bite-sized tasks that members can tackle to \u201clevel up\u201d in the DAO. Yearn has a [dashboard that aggregates open issues](https://contribute.yearn.rocks/) across their repositories, Polygon Ecosystem DAO [posts bounties and tasks](https://app.dework.xyz/0xpolygon-ecosystem/overview) for members to pick up to help promote the Polygon Ecosystem. These act as great ways to aggregate the tasks at hand, but disseminating that information among members is also equally important.\\n\\nFor DAOs that measure contributor engagement as a KPI for the value one brings to it, it is important to surface the right information (tasks, bounties, etc.) to the right people at the right time.\\n\\nThe state of communication in DAOs is reliant on platforms like Discord, whenever a new task or bounty is generated, it\u2019s pushed to Discord as a message which could just get lost like a needle in a haystack. This is not an ideal form of communication that could be achieved by DAOs, much more can be done.\\n\\nEPNS can act as the communication layer that proves to be vital for giving real-time updates and notifications to DAO members when a bounty is added, updated, or completed. This allows members to stay updated on all things DAO-related, and also be able to jump onto tasks that they see fit. This reduces any sort of confusion and helps in matching the right kind of people to the right kind of jobs, hence increasing DAO productivity tenfold.\\n\\n#### Payroll Processing & Compensation:\\n\\nOnce bounties or quests are completed, then comes the need to get paid for one\u2019s efforts. Different DAOs have different payment structures and mechanisms, there may be some bounty completers, some who are kept on recurring salary by the DAO, etc. No matter the payment structure for the members of a DAO, it is important for members to know when their payroll has been processed.\\n\\nOften we see DAOs processing the payments and having to either individually message each member that it has been processed, or not mention it at all.\\n\\nWith EPNS, DAOs can easily notify contributors about the status of their compensation, and contributors can immediately know when their efforts have been reimbursed. No more emails, or DMs that say \u201cYour compensation has been processed\u201d. Get a notification right at your fingertips that say \u201cCha-Ching! your DAO has sent you $$$ for your contributions!\u201d\\n\\n#### Decision Making & Treasury Management:\\n\\nAnother area that is tightly coupled with the above 2 points is DAO decision making & treasury management. A DAO thrives on its treasury \u2014 without it, the DAO cannot function. Proposals are created to decide on how the funds in the treasury are used to help the DAO grow and achieve its goals while members debate and vote on them. Tools like Snapshot are used for off-chain signature-based voting, while signaling is usually done on platforms like Discord or Governance Forums.\\n\\nHowever, there is usually a disparity between the number of active voters and the number of members in the DAO. This, coupled with the challenges of DAO treasury management such as transparency and insights into asset allocation and spending to assess performance and financial health, causes general confusion about the state of the DAO and limits its growth.\\n\\nIt is often hard for members to keep track of active proposals and new proposals that are proposed in the DAO on a regular basis, most DAOs expect their members to be actively involved in the Discord or check their Snapshot page for new proposals. This is not always easy for all members, and hence there needs to be a better way to communicate with members regarding this.\\n\\nEPNS can send notifications right at the fingertips of DAO members whenever there is a new proposal or there is new activity on an existing proposal. Members can stay updated easily about the state of the DAO and be more actively involved in the decision-making process of it. This reduces voter apathy and increases voter turnout, hence increasing decentralization in terms of governance.\\n\\nAs decisions are made, DAOs need to manage finances in their treasury \u2014 allocating funds to initiatives, giving away grants, compensating working groups, etc. However, there are challenges to this as well. There need to be more transparent insights into the overall financial health of the DAO and members of the DAO need to be aware of the actions taken by the treasury each time. Communication regarding treasury inflows, and outflows, and linking it to proposal spending, needs to be communicated well to the members of the DAO so they can make educated decisions when voting on certain crucial proposals. Communication of KPIs of a DAO is crucial for its members to feel safe and important within that community.\\n\\nEPNS helps in communicating these insights with members on a timely basis. Giving members a regular bird\u2019s eye view of the state of the DAO at a particular time.\\n\\nWe are still at the dawn of the emergence of DAOs, many are still figuring out best practices, standards, and processes that work for coordinating a decentralized internet-native community all over the world to build, invest, and create amazing things. Just like how DeFi and NFTs entered the mainstream world, DAOs are soon to follow, and the new era of digital collectives will be here to stay.\\n\\nDAO operations and communication tooling is getting better each day, and we are glad to have become a fundamental building block for the Web3 space that can help DAOs communicate effectively with their members and grow exponentially, by lowering the barriers and increasing user experience."},{"id":"epns-and-genesis-shards","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-and-genesis-shards","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-17-epns-and-genesis-shards/index.md","title":"EPNS and Genesis Shards Join Forces to Bring Push Notifications to Users","description":"EPNS and Genesis Shards Join Forces to Bring Push Notifications to Users","date":"2022-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 17, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"}],"readingTime":1.43,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-and-genesis-shards","title":"EPNS and Genesis Shards Join Forces to Bring Push Notifications to Users","description":"EPNS and Genesis Shards Join Forces to Bring Push Notifications to Users","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"EPNS and Hermes DeFi collaborate to bring decentralized push notifications to the DeFi on the Harmony blockchain.","tags":["Ethereum","Blockchain","Epnsproject"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Boosting DAO Infrastructure and Operations tooling by leveraging EPNS as the Communication Layer","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/boosting-dao-infrastructure"},"nextItem":{"title":"EPNS team up with EthSign to deliver notifications for the next generation of E-Signing platforms.","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-team-up-with-ethsign"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of EPNS and Genesis Shards Join Forces to Bring Push Notifications to Users](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nGenesis Shards, the new-age marketplace transforming NFTs into a vehicle for pre-IDO tokens collaborates with EPNS to enable direct communication between the platform and its users. Users of Genesis Shards can now expect to receive timely updates about staking pools and whitelists on the platform through push notifications.\\n\\n### Creating a Market for Illiquid Tokens\\n\\nAfter the monumental success of ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) in the early stages of the crypto industry, the emergent DeFi space came up with Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) to solve the issue of centralization and allow any upcoming DeFi project to raise funds. Today, IDOs seem to be the popular choice for token distribution, however, in the Pre-IDO stages projects still struggle with low token liquidity due to the lack of a tradable market.\\n\\nIn this context, Genesis Shards is a decentralized ecosystem that aims to create a new Pre-IDO market using NFTs to solve these issues. The platform transforms NFTs into vehicles that carry Pre-IDO tokens, creating a tradable market for previously illiquid tokens. Projects leveraging these new Pre-IDO NFTs can get access to liquidity in the early stages of development. Moreover, owing to the appeal of NFTs, these projects can build a strong community presence early on.\\n\\nAs such, Genesis Shards could vastly benefit from a communication channel that allows the platform to directly convey updates about newly available whitelists and investment opportunities to its users. This is where the collaboration with EPNS could be pivotal.\\n\\n### What Does the Alliance Entail?\\n\\nAs a part of the collaboration between EPNS and Genesis Shards, Genesis Shards will have an official channel on the EPNS platform. Users are free to subscribe to this channel and upon doing so, they become recipients of decentralized push notifications coming directly from Genesis Shards. They can expect notifications if and wherever\\n\\n- New staking pools are available\\n- Staking pools are closing\\n- A new project goes live\\n- They win an IDO whitelist\\n\\nAs Genesis Shards is transforming IDOs with its innovative Pre-IDO approach, we\u2019re enthralled to be a part of this journey and hope to be an integral part of their operations.\\n\\nAbout Genesis Shards\\nGenesis Shards is a marketplace for transforming NFTs into a liquidity vehicle for Pre-IDO tokens and a whole new suite of DeFi products across multiple blockchains. By wrapping time-locked fungible tokens into NFTs, the platform aims to create a new market for previously illiquid tokens.\\n\\nStay in touch!

From sporting events to film screenings and music concerts and art exhibitions, all events operate on a ticketing basis. This means that people interested in these events buy tickets to attend them. However, today\u2019s ticketing system is not as straightforward as it seems.\\n\\nThere is heavy involvement of third-party ticket sellers who make the most profits and take a significant share out of the sellers\u2019 pockets. Ticket buyers, on the other hand, end up paying more than what is required. Moreover, regular tickets come with the threat of being stolen, forged, or lost, and buyers end up missing out on their favorite events.\\n\\nThis is the gap that NFT TiX aims to bridge. By tokenizing tickets as NFTs, NFT TiX evades the need for third-party involvement and also ensures that the ticket truly belongs to its buyer. Apart from this, the ticket goes from being a liability to an asset that can be traded and sold anytime after the event. Special perks and incentives can also be etched into NFTs for the buyers. Industry experts believe that NFTs and the future of ticketing and NFT TiX is already taking strides in that direction.\\n\\nAs such, the platform needs a communication medium that keeps users updated about all the upcoming events, and EPNS aims to achieve that.\\n\\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our partnership with NFT TiX, we aim to create a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to directly interact with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and users of NFT-TiX can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. The notifications will be sent out whenever there is a new upcoming event of interest so that users can grab the various opportunities and attend their favorite events.\\n\\nEPNS has a Chrome extension, a DAPP, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe\u2019re pleased to team up with NFT TiX on their journey towards reimagine tickets as NFTs and hope to continue the alliance into the future.\\n\\n### About NFT-TiX\\n\\nNFT TiX a is a ticketing platform and marketplace built on Ethereum blockchain. It is run and governed by smart contracts, empowering ticket sellers to connect with ticket buyers one-on-one. This is a piece of revolutionary technology that helps the ticketing industry step away from middlemen once and for all.

See you there \ud83d\udc4b\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\" }} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XsKGDVdKEFc\\" title=\\"EPNS  Building Web3 Communication in your DeFi application\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\n<ImageText>Harsh Rajat, Founder & Project Lead \u2014 EPNS</ImageText>\\n\\n# \ud83d\udd14 Quick Rundown of EPNS\\n\\n**Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)** is the world\u2019s first decentralized communication & notification protocol for Web3. Using the protocol, any smart contract, dApp or back end can send on-chain or off-chain notifications tied to wallet addresses of a user in a multichain, open, platform agnostic way. Being an open communication middleware, notifs can be integrated and shown on any crypto wallet, mobile apps, extension or dApps.\\n\\n## Ideas to Buidl. Solve. Conquer.\\n\\nAs the blockchain ecosystem has evolved into a composable, multi-chain network, native Web3 communication is growing more and more necessary for user experience, developer operations, investor security, protocol architecture, and a lot more.\\n\\nToday\u2019s methods of communication between and among Web3 users and companies \u2014 dominated by Twitter, Discord, and Telegram \u2014 give rise to poor UX, scams, and sub optimal communication. Among some of the most pressing issues: smart contract version releases are missed, liquidation thresholds are not warned, NFT drops are forgotten, and vulnerabilities aren\u2019t communicated well.\\n\\nThe result is a fractured and siloed approach towards communication in the blockchain ecosystem, making room for an optimised, Web3-native solution. EPNS is created to fix this! This is how:\\n\\n**Integrate EPNS to your dApp and improve UX for all Web3 users**\\n\\n- This is probably the easiest, As EPNS is a communication layer, the best and quickest way to get this going is to integrate EPNS in your dApp via our frontend [**sdk & tutorial**](https://github.com/push-protocol/embed-demo-app) here\\n- This will not only improve the user experience for your dApp as users can now instantly see all their notifications across all their activities that they have opted in for but it also vastly improves the entire UX of the Web3 space.\\n\\n**_Screen1_**_\\\\- User is connected to their wallet and has loaded their dApp._\\n\\n![First image of Hack the future of DeFi powered with Web3 communication aka EPNS](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n**_Screen2_** _\u2014 User sees the EPNS notifications if they are subscribed to any channels in a sidebar which comes on the click on the bell icon._\\n\\n![Second image of Hack the future of DeFi powered with Web3 communication aka EPNS](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n**Create your dApp / protocol channel and send notifs**\\n\\n- So, you already integrated EPNS but like to also improve the experience for your users. Well, this is where you can jump in and create your own channel (any service that sends notifications are called channels).\\n- After which you can easily start sending important notifications about your project directly to the wallet address in a gasless way.\\n- Whether you are creating DAO, DeFi, NFT, Metaverse or anything in between, having a direct form of communication tied to user\u2019s wallet address massively improves the experience of your dApp (and goes extremely well with the bell icon you have integrated)\\n\\nCheck out our [**Showrunners**](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-tooling/showrunners-framework) **and** [**Tutorials**](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/examples/showrunners-example) here for more details\\n\\n**Create notifications channel for anything Web3**\\n\\n- A lot of projects and protocols are popular but still don\u2019t have notifications, you can build notifications for them, not only you get prizes for it but some amazing incentives are coming for the channels that are popular (though this is a different conversation). Some ideas that you can use if you want to build out a notif channel.\\n\\n**Web3Comm for DeFi**\\n\\nThe DeFi ecosystem is a landscape of constant innovation. We have seen an unprecedented amount of on-chain activity, prompting acute needs from users to keep on top of what is happening. EPNS is poised to accelerate the adoption of the DeFi ecosystem to meet the needs of users and dapps to keep up with rapid innovation.\\n\\nThis of course is one while most important we\u2019ve made quite a headway with a bunch of partners, however if you think you are able to renovate some of this, and build your own technology and have protocols that change the DeFi space for the better, we\u2019d definitely invite you to explore this side of things. Some of the things that EPNS can enable for DeFI protocols and their users is to solve critical DeFi problems as below..\\n\\n- Near Liquidation Alert (Borrowers & Liquidators)\\n- Staking Rewards Available to Claim (Stakers)\\n- Staking Rewards About to Expire (Stakers)\\n- Price Alerts (Traders)\\n- Stablecoin Peg Slippage (Arbitrageurs)\\n- Low Gas Cost (Devs, ETH Power Users)\\n- Rebalances (Token Set Users)\\n- Index Selection/Weighting Changes (Index Users)\\n- Token/Contract Migrations (Protocol Users)\\n- Governance Updates, Token Launches\\n- New Collateral Types on Money Markets\\n- New Liquidity Mining Incentives\\n- Yield Farming APY alerts\\n- Escrow Periods Ending / Tokens Coming Unlocked\\n\\nBesides these there are a ton of other applications that\u2019ll most web3 users in terms of getting communication or help on notification for that are of important notifications across the board.\\n\\n# \ud83d\udd17 Important Reference links for Developers\\n\\n- [EPNS Documentation Hub](https://docs.epns.io/)\\n\\n# \u260e\ufe0f Who do we reach out to for assistance?\\n\\nFeel free to reach out to us on the **sponsor-epns** channel on [**ETHGlobal Discord**](https://discord.gg/ethglobal)\\n\\n- Pranshu, Tech Lead (pranshu #1367)\\n- Jaf, Integration Lead (Jaf | EPNS#7611) and their teams will be happy to assist.\\n\\n# Throwback!!

As a result, users of OpenBiSea will get important updates pertaining to their NFT purchases and sales delivered to their devices.\\n\\n# The All-In-One NFT Marketplace OpenBiSea\\n\\nOpenBiSea is a smart contract-based NFT marketplace that aims to present a simplistic solution for buying, selling, and creating auctions for NFTs. The platform has Android, iOS, and web applications and through Binance Smart Chain (BSC) based smart contracts, the platform has successfully managed to streamline the process of NFT trading to an extent where users can cut deals for NFTs with just a few clicks.\\n\\nAll NFT auctions on OpenBiSea are automated within the smart contracts and by having bridge smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network, the platform gains multichain functionality. All NFT assets flow transparently and are stored unchanged on the blockchain.\\n\\nThe platform has a simple interface and an unmatched user experience, making it accessible to new users jumping the NFT bandwagon. And to improve this user experience, the platform aims to facilitate decentralized push notifications through EPNS, enabling direct interaction between the platform and its users.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nAs a result of this collaboration, OpenBiSea will have an official channel on the EPNS platform that users can subscribe to. Upon doing so, they receive decentralized push notifications whenever\\n\\n- Sellers get offers for their NFTs\\n- NFTs are successfully sold.\\n\\nThis kind of communication is fully decentralized and greatly reduces the need for centralized solutions in web3. EPNS also has a web app, a decentralized app, and a mobile application to help users receive reliable updates about their NFTs from time to time.\\n\\nWe\u2019re enthralled with our collaboration with OpenBiSea and hope to contribute to an unmatched user experience on the platform.\\n\\n# About OpenBiSea\\n\\nOpenBiSea NFT marketplace is a smart contract, iOS, Android, and web UI app. It is a simple, step-by-step guided solution to buy, sell and make auctions (smart contract-based) for NFT. The main core smart contracts are built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and have an Ethereum bridge for NFT assets.\\n\\nWe are connecting the entertainment industry with the global Metaverse.

As such, users of ShapeShift are poised to receive decentralized push notifications pertaining to the governance process. These notifications are designed to increase user participation and keep them updated about every step in the governance procedure.\\n\\n# ShapeShift: The Community-Owned Crypto Exchange\\n\\nAt its core, ShapeShift is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to buy, sell, trade, invest, and track digital assets. What distinguishes the platform from the rest is the fact that it is non-custodial, community-owned, and multichain operational. This means that users of the platform enjoy all the conveniences of a centralized crypto exchange while still being able to maintain full privacy and control of their crypto assets at all times. Moreover, there are no KYC or ID proof requirements to trade on the platform, and ShapeShift is the first to offer zero-commission trading to users.\\n\\nAs of this writing, ShapeShift has a lifetime trading volume of $6 billion with over 150,000 monthly active users. And users can benefit by choosing to participate in the platform governance on ShapeShift DAO. However, for the smooth running of the governance process, there is a need for a communication medium that keeps users informed of actionable steps to encourage participation. This is where EPNS plays a key role.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our partnership with ShapeShift, we envision the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to directly interact with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform, and users of ShapeShift can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications whenever:\\n\\n- New proposals are created for voting and the voting process begins\\n- The voting process is about to end ( sent 24 hours before)\\n- The results of the voting are declared\\n\\nThis allows users to grab the governance opportunities on ShapeShift at the right time and help steer the direction of its growth. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe\u2019re pleased to partner with ShapeShift on their journey towards making digital assets highly accessible and hope to continue the alliance into the future.\\n\\n# **About ShapeShift**\\n\\nSince 2014, ShapeShift has been pioneering self-custody for digital asset trading. Today\u2019s ShapeShift DAO is an engaged community of builders working to advance the state of crypto trading, investing and access to open, decentralized financial systems. Our web and mobile platforms empower users to safely buy, hold, trade, invest and interact with digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cosmos.\\n\\nStay in touch!

As such, users of 0VIX are poised to receive updates about the various happenings and opportunities, directly from the platform.\\n\\n# Redefining DeFi\u2019s Money Market\\n\\nDeFi\u2019s monumental success over the past few years is no secret now. While there are several contributing factors, it was DeFi\u2019s money market protocols that solidified the success of the industry, culminating into the mammoth of today.\\n\\nHowever, these protocols in the recent past have faced significant challenges, mostly pertaining to risk mitigation. Over-collateralization of assets is the common theme among all the protocols and even after years of decentralization, they maintain an opaque front when it comes to the liquidation of assets. Moreover, the lack of proper cross-chain bridging exposes user assets to operational risks and exploitation.\\n\\nIn this regard, as a DeFi 2.0 money market protocol, 0VIX aims to provide a viable solution to these problems while providing sustainable yields from DeFi to the mass market. The protocol makes use of voted escrow tokenomics and advanced interest rate models to mitigate risks and offer higher APYs to users. 0VIX is based on the Polygon network and aims to build a new money market ecosystem on Polygon. Combine this with a frictionless user experience and we have the recipe for a protocol that future proofs lending, borrowing, and staking of assets in DeFi, to create a money market with universal appeal.\\n\\nNow, as a DeFi protocol poised to receive an influx of new users, 0VIX can benefit from a communication channel that facilitates better communication with its users. This is exactly what we at EPNS aim to achieve with this collaboration.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail?\\n\\nThe collaboration between EPNS and 0VIX aims to create a direct communication channel between the users and the protocol for seamless interaction. This channel is housed on the EPNS platform where users of 0VIX can easily subscribe to it. Subscribers will receive decentralized push notifications from the platform whenever\\n\\n- Collateral approaches liquidation\\n- The Collateral has been liquidated\\n- Protocol parameters change\\n- New asset support is added to the platform\\n- Voting for governance begins or ends\\n\\nEPNS has a chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application to ensure users never miss out on these notifications. These notifications will build on the existing user experience on the platform and complement it by providing a sense of convenience to users.\\n\\nWe\u2019re pleased to have allied with 0VIX on this project and hope to contribute to the growth of the platform.\\n\\n# **About 0VIX**\\n\\n0VIX is an open-source lending and borrowing protocol enhanced with veTokenomics. Our focus is on providing stable and sustainable yields for Polygon users, through our native token $VIX. We aim to bring billions of dollars of liquidity to Polygon by providing the 3000+ app ecosystem with its first native money market.\\n\\n0VIX is built by the GOGO Protocol team, 35+ professionals, spread across 3 continents, with deep crypto/DeFi expertise and with roots in banking, finance, tech as well as more than 10 years of experience in building multi-billion dollar tech companies such as N26, Consensys, Binance, Deutsche Bank and Sovryn.\\n\\nJoin our community today!

The **Rockstars of EPNS** is our gratitude collection of 100 NFTs commissioned by Indian artists to show our appreciation for the incredible support of the Push community. 48, out of the 100 NFTs were gifted to our early advisors, supporters, and evangelists of the EPNS protocol who helped us reach so many milestones. The remaining 52 NFTs were allocated for community members.\\n\\nWe are proud to have these 52 well-wishers & supporters of EPNS who have contributed to the project in several ways.\\n\\n**Community-chosen winners**\\n\\nThe initial 24 Rockstars of EPNS were chosen by the EPNS team internally by carefully scrutinizing the submissions. Later, towards our efforts to make the platform progressively decentralized, the Push Governance community started choosing the winners among the nominations through governance voting. This made sure that the community\u2019s voice is heard.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\n**1\\\\. Token Gated Channel**\\n\\nTo nurture & grow this community of OG supporters of EPNS, an exclusive channel is created on Discord which you can join by verifying your Rockstar NFT. These channel members would be the first to get all the major upcoming alpha drops about EPNS. [Here is the guide on \u2018How to join the token gated discord\u2019](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/token-gated-channel-for-our-rockstar-community-db05bcb21778).\\n\\n**2\\\\. Opportunities with Community Tipping**\\n\\nWith 53% of PUSH allocated to the community, we plan on giving PUSH to the hands of the community in various ways. Major progress has been made in setting up a tipping tool called Coordinape. The [proposal](https://gov.epns.io/t/pip-04-coordinape-tipping-for-push-governance-community/543) to set up the same is in the Push Governance Process now(Make sure to [checkout](https://gov.epns.io/t/pip-04-coordinape-tipping-for-push-governance-community/543) & give feedback!). With that being said, we invite all the OG supporters of EPNS, the Rockstar Winners to continue supporting us & get incentivized via tipping.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Governance Engagement**\\n\\nPush Governance in the long run would be an inevitable part of EPNS that drives the protocol. As we move towards that goal, we invite the Rockstars to hold the baton for Push Governance, be the community leaders & engage in all Push Governance activities ([Forum](https://gov.epns.io/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/YVPB99F9W5)).\\n\\n## Thank you!\\n\\nAfter 52 weeks together, to thank all of you adequately is impossible.

We witnessed DeFi taking over the world, NFTs driving adoption and landing mainstream spots, Metaverse coming to a room near you and so many more things! And of course, the creation of EPNS Protocol, the communication layer for Web3 that will ensure all of these things (and more!) can function properly.\\n\\nWe had a phenomenal 2021 with building the tech that will empower the future of the internet aka Web3. Continuing with our vision of becoming the de-facto communication layer for Web3, the 2022 roadmap is designed to enable faster adoption of the EPNS protocol, becoming multi-chain, further perfecting the protocol, and enabling developers and wallets alike to integrate the protocol in the smoothest way possible.\\n\\nTo help us achieve our objectives, we will focus on the following product themes:\\n\\n- EPNS Protocol & Smart Contracts (Send Notifications)\\n- Progressive Decentralized Governance\\n- Front-End products: dApp, Mobile App, Browser extension\\n- PUSH Nodes (Retrieval & Dispatch)\\n- Technical Documentation\\n\\nTLDR;\\n\\n![First Image of Roadmap 2022](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n### EPNS Protocol (Send Notifications)\\n\\n![Second Image of Roadmap 2022](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n2021 witnessed the creation and [successful audit](https://epns.io/EPNS-Protocol-Audit2021.pdf) of the EPNS Smart Contracts!\\n\\nThe main goal of the EPNS Protocol is to make sure all communication is prepared and sent in compliance with the protocol standards. This will make every notification readily available to be picked up by the PUSH Nodes in charge of dispatching.\\n\\nThe year 2021 witnessed quite significant modifications in the EPNS Smart contract.\\n\\nAs we continue to work towards our vision of becoming blockchain agnostic, we have now ensured that our protocol is capable of effectively supporting multi-chain interoperability.\\n\\nIn order for us to provide a communication layer across multiple chains, our protocol has now been divided into 2 major components namely EPNS Core & EPNS Comm(Communicator). As per the current architecture, the EPNSCore contract shall only be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, the EPNSComm is designed to be used in multiple chains. Read more about the in-depth details about the contracts [here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/roadmap-q3-audited-epns-push-protocol-v1-is-here-f4560dfe550c).\\n\\nWhile some of our imperative features like Channel Creation, notification sending, subscribe/unsubscribe, etc; were already designed in our smart contracts, new features are coming to the protocol this year. For instance:\\n\\n- [Channel State cycles](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/roadmap-q3-audited-epns-push-protocol-v1-is-here-f4560dfe550c): This feature allows a channel\u2019s state to be changed in the protocol. A specific channel can either have an inactive, active, deactivated or even a blocked state. Moreover, a channel\u2019s activities and capabilities in the protocol will also be highly dependent on the state of the channel,\\n- Addition or Removal of Delegate Notification senders: Yes, the whole procedure of Sending notifications to subscribers can now be delegated to any given wallet address. As per the current architecture of the protocol, a channel owner has the power to add any specific wallet address as a valid delegate for his/her channel, thus allowing the wallet to send notifications on his behalf,\\n- Verification of Channels through the smart contracts.\\n- Meta transaction for Subscribing, Unsubscribing Sending notifications, etc\\n\\nAlthough most of the MVP features are already in place, there will be quite significant upgrades to the EPNS smart contracts in the year 2022 as well.\\n\\n#### Functionality for Claiming Interests:\\n\\n- One of the most significant features of our smart contracts and perhaps much-awaited one is the claim interests functionality that allows the users to claim their incentives from the contract.\\n- While this feature was initially planned for just the channel owners as well as subscribers in the EPNS contract, it is now being designed to distribute rewards among all $PUSH Token Holders. The incentives shall be in the form of $PUSH tokens themselves.\\n- This entire claim procedure shall be a part of the EPNS Core contracts and will be included very soon.\\n\\n#### On-Chain Governance Mechanism:\\n\\n- Since the launch of our EPNS Governance, it has been quite evident that EPNS wholeheartedly believes in the significance & power of a progressive decentralized governance system.\\n- While the EPNS community is actively participating in different governance frameworks like the Weekly Rockstar NFT, Grants program, etc, we shall have a similar procedure for the further development & upgrades of our smart contracts as well.\\n- As the EPNS Governance contracts have already qualified the entire security audit, the community shall soon be able to participate in the decision-making process for the inclusion of any new features in the contracts, upgrades of the contract to newer versions as well as the overall growth of the protocol.\\n- Moreover, some of the imperative functionalities of the current EPNS Core contract like blocking a channel permanently, verifying a channel, or revoking a channel\u2019s verification shall also be handled via the on-chain governance procedure itself.\\n\\n#### Wallet-to-Wallet Chat Functionality\\n\\n- As per our recent announcement, one of the super interesting features that we are planning to launch this year is the Wallet to Wallet Chat feature. This functionality is undoubtedly is one of its kind and we are planning to modify our EPNS Core and Comm contracts to ensure this feature can be used adequately.\\n\\n#### Designing EPNS Comm Contract for Non-EVM Chains:\\n\\n- Becoming blockchain agnostic demands equal attention to all the different types of chains that exist in the Web3 world.\\n- While EPNS smart contracts are specifically designed for EVM compatible chains at the moment, we shall soon initiate the design and development process of our smart contracts for non-EVM chains as well.\\n- Since the EPNS Communicator contract is supposed to be deployed on multiple chains, it is, by design, comparatively simpler than Core and does not rely on the core contract for any of its actions. Hence, we shall especially be focussing on designing the EPNS Communicator contract in order to make it ready for deployment across all different types of chains, including the non-EVM compatible chains.\\n\\nWe are making it easier for teams and individual contributors to make use of all these features to create solutions. A revamped version of the Showrunners Framework will be made available together with Integration Guides aiming to foster a healthy and creative developers community using EPNS as the building block for communication needs.\\n\\n### Progressive Decentralized Governance\\n\\n![Third Image of Roadmap 2022](./image-3.webp)\\n\\nWe began the year 2021 with a firm belief in the fact that an effective Governance mechanism is one of the most crucial pillars for a decentralized protocol as well as the bridge that links and connects the community to the project. And it can undoubtedly be stated that we haven\u2019t left a single stone unturned in our journey to build a <b>Progressive Decentralized Governance</b>, ever since.\\n\\nHere\u2019s what we did so far when it comes to governance:\\n\\n- Since its inception in the month of September 2021, the Governance framework was launched with 3 imperative ways for the community to be involved, i.e., <i>Weekly Rockstar NFT, Grants Program as well as Metagovernance.</i>\\n- In order to ensure adequate coordination within the community to make better decisions, the initial phase of the governance was more about laying out the specific processes, rules as well as roles of governance.\\n- Moreover, we gradually shifted towards the use of Snapshot for a decentralized voting mechanism. Considering Snapshot\u2019s easy gasless voting mechanism as well as our weekly EPNS Rockstart program, we saw steady growth in the number of delegates and participants in the Governance.\\n\\nWhile these were just a few of the highlights from last year, the EPNS governance has much bigger and more interesting plans for 2022. True to those same themes, 2022 will bring to the Community additional contribution & reward streams and further $PUSH voting empowerment involving the EPNS ecosystem and protocol.\\n\\nThe goal of the governance team is to bring us ever closer to becoming a true DAO. In 2022 we\u2019ll deliver the following:\\n\\n<i>EPNS On-Chain Governance Contracts</i>: While the EPNS Governance contracts were already audited last year, we shall achieve one of our most crucial milestones this year with the launch of our governance smart contracts.\\n\\nWith the deployment of the EPNS Governance contracts, we shall be able to ensure that the community is capable of actively participating as well as contributing to the overall development of the smart contracts.\\n\\n<i>Meta-Governance and DAO Partnerships</i>: The process of \u201cDAO-ification\u201d requires a robust governance environment and we get closer to that goal every day.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll continue growing our Community, delivering the features wanted, and facilitating contributors to dedicate their talents to EPNS. One overall piece will be meta-governance, this means making our governance processes available to other communities outside our own and vice versa \u2014 giving $PUSH holders a greater voice in the web3 ecosystem.\\n\\nUnder this umbrella is partnering with other DAOs we identify as a community to be beneficial. That part is sort of intentionally vague because web3 collaboration is always changing and we want to evolve with it.\\n\\n<i>Governance Website & dApp</i>: Additionally we shall also have a separate website specifically for the Governance procedure. This shall include all information regarding our governance. It shall allow our community members to create new proposals, vote on proposals, and also include our governance dashboard as well as other governance tooling integration.\\n\\n### Front-End Products\\n\\n![Fourth Image of Roadmap 2022](./image-4.webp)\\n\\nWe started 2021 with a very specific plan of providing effective user interfaces for our users to connect with our products and services. The three main UI components that we built last year were:\\n\\n- dApp (Decentralized Application)\\n- Mobile Apps (IOS & Android)\\n- Browser Extension\\n\\n#### dApp (Decentralized Application)\\n\\nWhile most of the foundational features for the dApp were already developed in Q1 of 2021 itself, we have included some really interesting as well as significant features for both Channels and Users, as well. For instance:\\n\\nFor Channel Owners:\\n\\n- A Channel Profile Page for every channel that includes all important details about a channel as well as crucial channel settings. Moreover, a specific channel\u2019s profile page shall only be accessible by the owner of the channel.\\n- The Addition or Removal of a Delegate is an imperative action that can only be taken by the owner of a particular channel. This shall allow channel owners to add any wallet address as a valid delegate to send the notification on the channel\u2019s behalf. Importantly, the channel owner can also a particular delegate at any given time.\\n- Deactivation of a Channel feature is a new feature that allows a channel owner to deactivate his/her channel. However, it\'s imperative to note that deactivation is an action that can only be performed by the owner of that channel while also allowing the channel owner to reactivate their channel whenever they want. The in-depth details about the deactivate channel feature can be found [here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/roadmap-q3-audited-epns-push-protocol-v1-is-here-f4560dfe550c).\\n- The [Channel verification badge](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/roadmap-q3-audited-epns-push-protocol-v1-is-here-f4560dfe550c) feature is now also live on the dApp. This is a really interesting feature that not just assigns a verification badge for channels and aligns them in a better position in the UI but also allows the verified channels to verify other unverified channels.\\n\\n<i>For Subscribers</i>\\n\\n- Gasless Subscribe or Unsubscribe is perhaps one of the most significant and useful features that we implemented in the dApp. This allows an incredibly smooth as well as a zero-cost opt-in procedure for the users. Subscribing to a channel is now as simple as just signing the transaction with your wallet address without the need to pay any gas.\\n- Channel Search Bar in the dApp now allows users to look out for any channel that they want and opt-in easily.\\n\\n#### What\u2019s Next for the dApp?\\n\\nNow that we have the basic and important features in place already, this year we are planning to add quite significant ones to enhance the user experience on the dApp. Some of them being:\\n\\n- Redesigning of the dApp UI: To begin with, the [EPNS dApp](https://app.epns.io/) shall soon have a brand new UI design with a comparatively better experience for users. Since we already have started working on our new interface, we might have the new UI ready by Q1 of this year itself.\\n- Notification settings for Users and Channels: One of the most significant features that shall be launched this year is the notification setting for both users and channels.\\n  When it comes to notifications, a specific channel might have different types of notifications. While some notifications deal with the Governance updates of that channel, others might be related to the loan liquidations. Now with Channel notification settings, the channel owner shall be able to provide specific notification options to its users depending on the different kinds of notification a channel might have to offer.\\n\\nOn the other hand, notification settings for users shall allow users to be capable of being selective in terms of the notifications that they receive. Users will be able to precisely select only those notification options from a channel that they are interested in.\\n\\nIn other words, a user only interested in the governance proposals of a particular channel shall not receive other types of notifications from that channel despite being a valid subscriber of the channel.\\n\\n- The dApp will also include a feature that allows editing or modifying a Channel\u2019s Detail. This, however, shall only be doable by the owner of that channel.\\n- Search and Filteration of Notifications shall also be included in the dApp to simplify the process of searching for a particular notification.\\n\\n#### Mobile App\\n\\nQuite similarly to the dApp, our mobile apps have also come a long way now. While the early stages had only some of the initial important features on the apps, we have included quite a lot of significant features in the last year and modified our apps. Some of those features are as follows:\\n\\n- Channel Discovery feature was added, which allows users to look at all the channels associated with EPNS.\\n- The Spam Box feature on our mobile apps ensured that the Spam notifications never entered the inbox of a user.\\n- Quite importantly, the Wallet Connect sign feature was enabled in the mobile app to ease the sign-in process.\\n- Moreover, the Opt-in feature was included in the mobile app. This allowed users to subscribed to their favorite channels right from their mobile.\\n\\nThis year, we are planning to add the following features to the mobile app:\\n\\n- Support sign-in with multiple wallets so that the users can receive notifications for all their wallet addresses in one single place.\\n- Filters and search options for the channels list.\\n- Options to mute notifications for a specific time\\n- Visualizations for multi-chain notifications.\\n- Provide richer notifications for channels.\\n\\n#### Browser Extension\\n\\nWhile we already have the Browser Extension in place and completely functional now, this year we are planning on providing a richer and better UI design for the EPNS extension to ensure its on-pair with all other front-end product capabilities where it makes sense.\\n\\n### PUSH Nodes (Retrieval & Dispatch)\\n\\n![Fifth Image of Roadmap 2022](./image-5.webp)\\n\\nPush Nodes can undoubtedly be stated as one of the most crucial components in our journey towards becoming a true reliable communication layer for the Web3 world.\\n\\nLast year we included the following features in our Push Nodes:\\n\\n- Off-Chain Notification\\n- Spam Feature\\n- Support for Polygon Notification\\n- Using local IPFS instance\\n- S3 Bucket Backup\\n\\nWhile some of the very significant features of the Push Nodes were already built last year, this year we are planning to make our Push Nodes more powerful and effective. Some of the critical features that we are planning for the year 2022 are as follows:\\n\\n- <b>Decentralization of Push Nodes</b>: While there is no denying the fact that our aim is to become a blockchain agnostic communication layer, we also understand that decentralization of our Push Nodes is unquestionably one of our top priorities. This is why we have tasked ourselves to decentralize the push nodes this year and achieve our goal of becoming a truly decentralized middleware solution.\\n  Decentralization of our push nodes is going to be a very imperative step towards becoming blockchain agnostic as this ensures higher scalability, stronger support for Layer 2 solutions as well enhanced performance, etc.\\n\\nMoreover, along with the decentralization of our nodes, we shall also be implementing an effectual incentive mechanism for our active participants.\\n\\n- <b>User and Channel Notification settings</b>: As previously mentioned, the notification settings for both users and channels are one of the much-awaited features that we shall introduce this year.\\n\\nWhile our audited EPNS Core and EPNS Comm smart contracts already have the notification settings functions for both channels & users respectively, one of our important tasks this year is to ensure our push nodes are ready to support this feature.\\n\\n- <b>Wallet-to-Wallet Chat feature</b>: The wallet-to-wallet chat feature is one of those super interesting features that the community is really looking forward to. Therefore, effectively enabling our push nodes to support this feature is one of the major tasks we are planning to work on by the Q3 of the year 2022.\\n- <b>Multi-chain support</b>: Since the EPNS smart contracts are already designed keeping in mind our vision of becoming blockchain agnostic, we also plan to ensure that our Push nodes are capable of handling multi-chain support. While we are already on the Ethereum blockchain, we will very soon launch our contracts on different chains like Polygon, BSC, etc. The year 2022 will not just witness the EPNS Contract on EVM compatible chains but also on non-EVM compatible chains like Solana.\\n\\nAdditionally, we are also planning to provide an analytics dashboard for Push Nodes\\n\\n#### Technical Documentation\\n\\n![Sixth Image of Roadmap 2022](./image-6.webp)\\n\\nWhile we have been more inclined towards developing different components of our product, we are quite aware of the significance of effectual documentation.\\n\\nThis year, we are also planning to roll out extensive technical documentation as well as guides for both developers and users. Along with publishing new documentation we shall also be updating our previous technical documents, whitepaper and ensure that they are up-to-the-minute with all the latest changes.\\n\\nSome of the crucial topics that we are planning to cover this year are as follows:\\n\\n<i>\\n- Documentation on Back-end SDK\\n- Documentation on Front-end SDK\\n- Tutorial for Using Backend-SDK to Set-Up notifications for a channels\\n- Tutorial for Using Frontend SDK to integrate EPNS on a specific Protocol\u2019s dApp\\n- Detailed description and explanation of CLAIM Functionality and incentive mechanisms of our EPNS Core smart contract\\n- Detailed Explanation on W2W Chat Feature.\\n</i>\\n\\nWith these plans for the product\u2019s roadmap 2022, we have started this year with utmost belief and commitment to our mission of providing an effective and reliable communication layer for the Web3 world.\\n\\nIf you have any comments or questions please feel free to reach out to us on telegram or check out our website for more details: https://epns.io/"},{"id":"buidl-w-epns-ideas-to-hack","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/buidl-w-epns-ideas-to-hack","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-20-buidl-w-epns-ideas-to-hack/index.md","title":"BUIDL w/ EPNS: Ideas to hack the future of #Web3Comm!","description":"BUIDL w/ EPNS: Ideas to hack the future of #Web3Comm!","date":"2022-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 20, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Hacking","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/hacking"},{"label":"Development","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/development"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Solidity","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/solidity"}],"readingTime":4.35,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"buidl-w-epns-ideas-to-hack","title":"BUIDL w/ EPNS: Ideas to hack the future of #Web3Comm!","description":"BUIDL w/ EPNS: Ideas to hack the future of #Web3Comm!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"EPNS (Ethereum Push Notification Service) is calling all developers to work with us to build on top of our protocol","tags":["Hacking","Development","Ethereum","Blockchain","Solidity"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EPNS Roadmap 2022","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-roadmap-2022"},"nextItem":{"title":"Devconnect 2022: EPNS is all set to meet you!","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/devconnect-2022-epns-is-all-set"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of BUIDL w/ EPNS: Ideas to hack the future of #Web3Comm!](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nEPNS (Ethereum Push Notification Service) is calling all developers to work with us to build on top of our protocol\\n\\n**What\u2019s Up ETHAmsterdam?**\\n\\nCalling all Developers to BUIDL on EPNS Protocol!\\n\\nAmsterdam! Wow! So great to be in one of the coolest cities of Europe and having to meet some of the most amazing, coolest and rockstar BUIDlers of Web3! We shared our entire plan at Devconnect in our blog [**here**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/devconnect-2022-epns-is-all-set-to-meet-you-e5dbd3d16e96)!\\n\\nThough shortly afterward, a lot of folks reached out asking about what we would want to see built on top of EPNS protocol for the prize pool we are hosting at [**ETHAmsterdam**](https://amsterdam.ethglobal.com/) between **22nd-24th April 2022**\\n\\nWell, the answer to this is whatever you\u2026 the cool dev wants to buidl is what we want! But here are some cool ideas to get your creative juice flowing! Of course, We have some cool prizes and swags for each one of you, scroll to the bottom in case you want to learn about that!\\n\\n# Quick rundown of EPNS\\n\\n**Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)** is the world\u2019s first decentralized communication & notification protocol for Web3. Using the protocol, any smart contract, dApp or backend can send on-chain or off-chain notifications tied to wallet addresses of a user in a multichain, open, platform agnostic way. Being an open communication middleware, notifs can be integrated and shown on any crypto wallet, mobile apps, extension or dApps.\\n\\n# Ideas to Buidl. Solve. Conquer.\\n\\nAs the blockchain ecosystem has evolved into a composable, multi-chain network, native Web3 communication is growing more and more necessary for user experience, developer operations, investor security, protocol architecture, and a lot more.\\n\\nToday\u2019s methods of communication between and among Web3 users and companies \u2014 dominated by Twitter, Discord, and Telegram \u2014 give rise to poor UX, scams, and sub optimal communication. Among some of the most pressing issues: smart contract version releases are missed, liquidation thresholds are not warned, NFT drops are forgotten, and vulnerabilities aren\u2019t communicated well.\\n\\nThe result is a fractured and siloed approach towards communication in the blockchain ecosystem, making room for an optimised, Web3-native solution. EPNS is created to fix this! This is how:\\n\\n**Integrate EPNS to your dApp and improve UX for all Web3 users**\\n\\n- This is probably the easiest, As EPNS is a communication layer, the best and quickest way to get this going is to integrate EPNS in your dApp via our frontend **sdk & tutorial** here\\n- This will not only improve the user experience for your dApp as users can now instantly see all their notifications across all their activities that they have opted in for but it also vastly improves the entire UX of the Web3 space.\\n\\n**_Screen1_**_\\\\- User is connected to their wallet and has loaded their dApp._\\n![First image of BUIDL w/ EPNS: Ideas to hack the future of #Web3Comm!](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n**_Screen2_** _\u2014 User sees the EPNS notifications if they are subscribed to any channels in a sidebar which comes on the click on the bell icon._\\n![Second image of BUIDL w/ EPNS: Ideas to hack the future of #Web3Comm!](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n**Create your dApp / protocol channel and send notifs**\\n\\n- So, you already integrated EPNS but like to also improve the experience for your users. Well, this is where you can jump in and create your own channel (any service that sends notifications are called channels).\\n- After which you can easily start sending important notifications about your project directly to the wallet address in a gasless way.\\n- Whether you are creating DAO, DeFi, NFT, Metaverse or anything in between, having a direct form of communication tied to user\u2019s wallet address massively improves the experience of your dApp (and goes extremely well with the bell icon you have integrated)\\n\\nCheck out our [**Showrunners and Tutorials**](https://docs.epns.io/developer-zone/developer-guides/working-with-showrunners) here for more details\\n\\n**Create notifications channel for anything Web3**\\n\\n- A lot of projects and protocols are popular but still don\u2019t have notifications, you can build notifications for them, not only you get prizes for it but some amazing incentives are coming for the channels that are popular (though this is a different conversation). Some ideas that you can use if you want to build out a notif channel.\\n\\n**Web3Comm for DeFi**\\n\\nThe DeFi ecosystem is a landscape of constant innovation. We have seen an unprecedented amount of on-chain activity, prompting acute needs from users to keep on top of what is happening. EPNS is poised to accelerate the adoption of the DeFi ecosystem to meet the needs of users and dapps to keep up with rapid innovation.\\n\\nThis of course is one while most important we\u2019ve made quite a headway with a bunch of partners, however if you think you are able to renovate some of this, and build your own technology and have protocols that change the DeFi space for the better, we\u2019d definitely invite you to explore this side of things. Some of the things that EPNS can enable for DeFI protocols and their users is to solve critical DeFi problems as below..\\n\\n- Near Liquidation Alert (Borrowers & Liquidators)\\n- Staking Rewards Available to Claim (Stakers)\\n- Staking Rewards About to Expire (Stakers)\\n- Price Alerts (Traders)\\n- Stablecoin Peg Slippage (Arbitrageurs)\\n- Low Gas Cost (Devs, ETH Power Users)\\n- Rebalances (Token Set Users)\\n- Index Selection/Weighting Changes (Index Users)\\n- Token/Contract Migrations (Protocol Users)\\n- Governance Updates, Token Launches\\n- New Collateral Types on Money Markets\\n- New Liquidity Mining Incentives\\n- Yield Farming APY alerts\\n- Escrow Periods Ending / Tokens Coming Unlocked\\n\\nBesides these there are a ton of other applications that\u2019ll most Web3 users in terms of getting communication or help on notification for that are of important notifications across the board.\\n\\nHope these ideas are some that you find exciting to build, and if you do have any queries feel free to reach out to us on Twitter @epnsproject\\n\\n# **Let\u2019s talk prizes and our $1M grant!**\\n\\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, ETHAmsterdam, then you might already know we have an exciting [**Prize Pool**](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethamsterdam/prizes) that\u2019s up for grabs!\\n\\n**PRIZE OVERVIEW \u2014 For ETHAmsterdam Hackathon**\\n\\n- **4x $500** for the best creation of channel/ Dapp/ use Frontend SDK in their Dapp.\\n- **2x $1,000** for the most creative use of Backend SDK / Smart Contract in your Dapp, web3, communication layer.\\n\\nBut that\u2019s not just it!

As such, Cryptex Finance will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the governance process and other happenings on the platform.\\n\\n# Tokenizing Total Crypto Market Cap\\n\\nThe total crypto market cap is one of the key metrics used to gauge the growth of the industry and is widely quoted by investors across the globe. In this regard, Cryptex Finance is a platform that aims to tokenize this key metric to allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of the entire industry.\\n\\nThe platform introduces the world\u2019s finance total market cap token TCAP which is a fully backed and fully collateralized asset that accurately represents the total crypto market cap at all times. Investors can mint TCAP by creating a vault and adding collateral. Then, the token can be used just like any other token for trading, providing liquidity, and earnings yield farming rewards.\\n\\nThe platform is secured and managed by the holders of the governance token CTX, who steer the direction and the future growth of the platform. As such, Cryptex Finance can vastly benefit from a decentralized communication mechanism that allows the platform to keep users updated about the governance process, along with the status of their vault collaterals. This is where EPNS plays a pivotal role.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail?\\n\\nAs a result of this pilot collaboration, Cryptex Finance will have an official channel housed on the EPNS platform that once it goes live will allow users of Cryptex to subscribe to this channel to receive notifications whenever the collateral ratios in their vaults fall low and whenever new governance proposals are created for voting. Users can also expect to receive the voting results as push notifications once they are declared. This saves them the hassle of manually checking for all these updates and improves the user experience on the platform along with the participation rates.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to kickstart this integration with Cryptex Finance and hope to contribute to the growth of the platform.\\n\\n# **About Cryptex Finance**\\n\\nCryptex Finance is an Ethereum-based protocol that lets traders, funds, and DeFi users get exposure to the total crypto market capitalization.\\n\\n[Website](https://cryptex.finance/), [Blog](https://cryptex.finance/#news), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptexfinance), [Telegram](https://t.me/cryptexfinance), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cryptex)"},{"id":"announcing-our-series-a","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/announcing-our-series-a","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-14-announcing-our-series-a/index.md","title":"Announcing Our $10.1 Million Series A!","description":"Announcing Our $10.1 Million Series A!","date":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Fundraising","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/fundraising"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Decentralization","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/decentralization"},{"label":"Announcements","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/announcements"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"}],"readingTime":2.66,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"announcing-our-series-a","title":"Announcing Our $10.1 Million Series A!","description":"Announcing Our $10.1 Million Series A!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We\u2019re proud to announce that EPNS has raised $10.1 million to continue building out the communication infrastructure for the decentralized future.","tags":["Fundraising","Web3","Decentralization","Announcements","Ethereum"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EPNS Integration Underway to Enable Seamless Communication for Users Within the Cryptex Finance App","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-integration-underway-to-enable"},"nextItem":{"title":"EPNS and CoinDesk Announce Media Push Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-and-coindesk-announce-media-push-notifications"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of Announcing Our $10.1 Million Series A!](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n> We\u2019re proud to announce that EPNS has raised $10.1 million to continue building out the communication infrastructure for the decentralized future.\\n\\nToday, we\u2019re proud to announce that EPNS has raised a $10.1 million Series A funding round, with an average valuation of $131M. Jump Crypto led the round, with additional participation from Tiger Global, ParaFi, A.Capital, Sino Global Capital, Polygon Studios, Harmony Foundation, Wintermute, Zee Prime Capital, Woodstock, DCX Ventures, Alpha Wave Capital, Zebpay, TRGC, Signum Capital and iSeedVC. The Series A also included investments from Web3 leaders Andrew Keys of DARMA Capital, David Silverman of Aave Companies, Ajit Tripathi, Kane Warwick, Jordan Momtazi and Justin Moses of Synthetix, Aniket Jindal of Biconomy, Anton Bukov of 1inch, Sahil Dewan of Harmony, Mateo a Levy, Jerome de Tychey of Cometh and Ethereum France, Sam of Journal du Coin. The Series A round comes with either a 9 to 12 months cliff for each investor along with 24 months to 30 months vesting.\\n\\nWe will use the funding from the Series A to expand the team, grow the user base, and develop beyond the Ethereum ecosystem to stay true to the vision of a multi-chain, interoperable decentralized future. With a robust team, tech implementation and resources, EPNS will keep perfecting the protocol, building wallet to wallet communication in Web3, and enabling developers and wallets alike to integrate the protocol in the smoothest way possible.\\n\\nWhat an incredible milestone for EPNS \u2014 and so much of it is thanks to the support, engagement, and excitement of the community. You\u2019ve been with us from our earliest days of hackathons and grants to our token generation event, our seed funding announcement, mainnet launch, and now Series A. We\u2019re excited for what lies ahead, and we want to welcome you to join this next phase of the EPNS protocol and the improvement of Web3.\\n\\n**If you\u2019re new to EPNS, here\u2019s a quick rundown of why we\u2019re here.** As the blockchain ecosystem has evolved into a composable, multi-chain network, native Web3 communication is growing more and more necessary for user experience, developer operations, investor security, protocol architecture, and a lot more. Today\u2019s methods of communication between and among Web3 users and companies \u2014 dominated by Twitter, Discord, and Telegram \u2014 give rise to poor UX, scams, and suboptimal communication. Among some of the most pressing issues: smart contract version releases are missed, liquidation thresholds are not warned, NFT drops are forgotten, and vulnerabilities aren\u2019t communicated well. The result is a fractured and siloed approach towards communication in the blockchain ecosystem, making room for an optimized, Web3-native solution.\\n\\nStarting with Ethereum and growing to other networks, EPNS is building the native Web3 communication protocol to enable users to speak to one another on-chain. EPNS enables permissionless channel notification and channel subscription along two categories of users: Channels (individuals or companies that wish to issue communication) and Subscribers (individuals that opt-in to receive communication). Currently, EPNS is powering on-chain notifications for ENS (domain expiration), CoinDesk (media alerts), Snapshot (governance updates), Oasis (vault liquidation), and more. Since mainnet launch in mid-January, EPNS has powered 4 million notifications sent to over 44,000 subscribers. EPNS is working with over 80 projects including the likes of Uniswap, Decentraland, MakerDAO, Gitcoin, Polygon, ENS, dYdX, Bancor, Defiant, Coindesk, Aragon, Notional Finance, mStable, Snapshot and more!\\n\\n[**Come join us!**](https://angel.co/company/ethereum-push-notification-service) **|** [**Checkout EPNS**](https://app.epns.io/#/live_walkthrough)\\n\\n# **FAQs**\\n\\n**What\u2019s the token design / economics?**\\n\\nThe v1 $PUSH token economics [can be found here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-token-economics-d7f566c29b1a). The token design will evolve to also include v2 contract features (including wallet to wallet chat), [more info on those here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-contract-v2-features-e7887fac72a6).\\n\\n**What\u2019s the token allocation and how does this affect the community?**\\n\\nTLDR; the raise doesn\u2019t affect the $PUSH community allocation, which is 53%. You can read about the [token allocation model here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/announcing-the-epns-push-token-generation-event-4d1699e716f5#:~:text=The%20EPNS%20team%20is%20allocated,a%2048%20month%20vesting%20period.).\\n\\nThe new raise comes from carving unlocked allocation out from the Foundation, from advisors, and from Founders who have agreed to return their soon-to-be-uncliffed tokens for the benefit of the protocol. Furthermore, The tokens are cliffed and vested for each investor so the token allocation model improves as the unlocked supply gets locked again.\\n\\n**What are the terms for Series A investors?**\\n\\nWhile we cannot disclose the exact terms, all series A investors have a cliff of either 9 or 12 months and are vested for 24 to 30 months.\\n\\n**Why is the raise needed?**\\n\\nThis raise was extremely strategic for the EPNS protocol, as this marks the journey to go to multichain and replicate the traction and love we got from launching on Ethereum. The next step in this multichain journey is Polygon, followed shortly by Binance and Harmony.

As a result of this partnership, users of Decentraland will soon receive updates about their transactions through decentralized push notifications.\\n\\nIn the recent past, the metaverse went from being a sci-fi dream to a striking reality that is now unfolding rapidly. The development of blockchain technology and the possibility of a virtual economy powered by digital assets, acted as catalysts to this development, allowing developers to create virtual worlds and experiences, seemingly overnight. In this race toward the metaverse, Decentraland was the earliest and most popular project to bring fully immersive virtual experiences to its users.\\n\\n# Redefining Communication Within Virtual Worlds\\n\\nPowered by the Ethereum network, Decentraland is a community-owned, fully-immersive virtual world that users can experience and interact with. The platform is community-owned as it is fully decentralized and governed by its community of users through the Decentraland DAO. Users become a part of this virtual world as a digital avatar and are free to explore it and experience what it has to offer. Users also have the opportunity to own virtual real-estate in Decentraland and build and monetize their own environments upon it.\\n\\nDecentraland\u2019s virtual economy is powered by MANA, a ERC-20 token that serves as the currency within the virtual world. LAND and Estate hold the ERC-721 standard, representing parcels and merged parcels of digital land. Holders of the LAND essentially own a small part of the metaverse and are free to create experiences and applications in the Decentraland world. Other users can interact with these experiences, win and trade collectibles with fellow users, and even learn at the Decentraland University.\\n\\nGiven the sheer number of experiences and possibilities within this virtual world, it is only fitting for Decentraland to have a communication layer of its own through which it can keep its users apprised of the status of their Marketplace transactions. Through our pilot collaboration with the platform, we\u2019re keen on building this layer.\\n\\n_\u201cDecentraland is revolutionizing user interactions over the internet,\u201d_ says Harsh Rajat, co-founder of EPNS, _\u201cthe network effects of this platform can create massive online communities where users can play, explore, experience, and earn through their interactions with each other. In this regard, EPNS push notifications will serve as a communication layer within the virtual world, allowing users to constantly stay updated and engaged with its happenings. Much like Web2\u2019s social media notifications.\u201d_\\n\\n# What the Collaboration Entails\\n\\nAs a result of this pilot collaboration, Decentraland will have an official channel on the EPNS platform that users can subscribe to. This official channel serves as a communication medium that relays out important information as push notifications to all its subscribers as and when it happens. This reduces user dependence on external media and improves user experience and user engagement rates. Subscribers can expect to receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- When a bid is offered on one of their NFTs\\n- When a bid is accepted\\n- When an order is executed\\n\\nSpeaking of the collaboration, the team at Decentraland said, \u201c_We\u2019re thrilled to form this pilot collaboration with EPNS. Having closely followed their developments and efforts to redefine communication in Web3, we believe EPNS would be a great addition for the Decentraland community, allowing them to be more reactive to what is happening._\u201d\\n\\nAs Decentraland continues to build immersive experiences for Web3, we\u2019re pleased to partner with them on their ambitious journey.\\n\\n# **About Decentraland**\\n\\nDecentraland is the first fully decentralized, Ethereum-based virtual world that is built, governed, and owned by its users. The ever-expanding metaverse is a truly unique ecosystem with its own currency, marketplace, system of property, and decentralized autonomous organization. In this richly detailed world, new creations, such as games, puzzles, artwork, and even whole environments, are added on a daily basis by members of the community. Users are free to explore and discover what Decentraland has to offer as digital avatars and attend live concerts, conferences, exhibitions, dance parties, and many other events that happen every day of the year. In Decentraland the possibilities are simply limitless, and there\u2019s always something to do and new people to meet.

Let\u2019s dive in and get a brief overview of each of the new features that we are working on.\\n\\n### 1. Channel Creation with $PUSH Token (instead of DAI)\\n\\nOne of the most crucial modifications in the new version of our smart contracts will be in the channel creation procedure.\\n\\nAs per the current contract design, in order to create a channel, the channel creator must deposit a sum of 50 DAI to the EPNS Core contract.\\n\\nHowever, with the deployment of the new version of the contract, the channel creation procedure will require the user to use the $PUSH token instead of DAI. The users shall now be able to create channels by depositing a minimum amount of 50 $PUSH to the protocol.\\n\\nThe usage of the $PUSH token for channel creation is one of the imperative steps in the direction of having more utility for our $PUSH token. The underlying channel creation mechanism in the smart contract, however, shall remain the same.\\n\\n### 2. Allowing PUSH Holders to CLAIM their rewards\\n\\nIt can be undoubtedly stated that the functionality for claiming rewards has been one of the most awaited features for our EPNS Core smart contracts, and is probably the star function of our 2nd version of the smart contract.\u2b50\ufe0f\\n\\nIn order to provide some colors to it, the intention of claim functionality is to not just limit our users to receiving notifications but also allow them to earn and claim their rewards in $PUSH tokens for being active users of the protocol.\\n\\n<b>Brief glance at the reward mechanisms</b>\\n\\nThe 2nd version of our EPNS Core contract will come with some imperative modifications in the way rewards are generated and distributed among the participants.\\n\\nThe previous architecture of our EPNS Core contract involved the usage of the AAVE lending protocol for interest generation. As per the current version, whenever a new channel is created, the channel creation fees(DAI) deposited by the channel owner are being lent out to the AAVE\u2019s lending protocol. This ensures that the EPNS Core contract receives the aDAI tokens as interests.\\n\\nHowever, with the upgrade of the contract, this procedure for interest generation shall be changed. The new version of the contract shall not include any dependencies on AAVE\u2019s lending protocol. Moreover, as previously mentioned, the token used for the channel creation fee shall also be changed to $PUSH instead of DAI.\\n\\nUnlike the current contract structure, the 2nd version of the contract shall not deposit the channel creation fees to AAVE. Instead, a particular fraction of the $PUSH token that is to be used for channel creation, shall be stored in the fee pool of the contract.\\n\\nMoreover, while incentives were initially planned to be distributed only among the channel owners as well as subscribers, they shall now be claimable by every $PUSH Token holder. The amount of rewards claimable by a particular user shall rely on the holder weight of that particular user.\\n\\n<blockquote><i>More details about the reward distribution mechanism of the EPNS Core contract shall be shared soon</i></blockquote>\\n\\n### 3. Channel Owners will be able to UPDATE-EDIT their channel details\\n\\nThe new version of the EPNS core shall include the required function that allows a channel owner to edit his channel\u2019s details.\\n\\nBefore I dive deep into this feature, let\u2019s quickly understand what exactly do I mean by channel details.\\n\\nWhenever a channel is created from the dApp, the creator is required to pass 4 important parameters, i.e.,\\n\\n- Channel\u2019s Name\\n- Channel\u2019s Description\\n- Channel\u2019s Logo, and\\n- Channel\u2019s CTA\\n\\nOnce all these details are passed, they together form the channel\u2019s identity bytes, which are then stored on IPFS.\\n\\nHowever, as per the current implementation of our dApp, a channel cannot edit any of these details once the channel creation is successfully completed. While this leads to an unwanted scenario where any mistake done during channel creation cannot be rectified later, it also stops a channel owner to add or modify their pre-existing channel description, name, or logo\\n\\nHence, after a few internal discussions and taking in some valuable feedback from our community, we decided to resolve this concern and include the relevant functions in the smart contracts, to begin with.\\n\\nThe 2nd version of the EPNS Core contract shall have a function that allows, only the channel owner of a particular channel, to edit any specific detail about his/her channel.\\n\\n<i>Wait! There\u2019s a CATCH</i>\\n\\nThe channel update function in the contract, however, comes with 2 crucial pointers and requirements.\\n\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f <b>he NOTICE Sign</b> \u26a0\ufe0f: Whenever a channel owner modifies any specific detail about his/her channel on the protocol, the channel shall appear with an additional note in the View Channels section of the DAPP UI. This note will inform the rest of the users as well as subscribers about the channel\u2019s old name or description.\\n- \ud83d\udcb0 <b>Channel Edit Fees</b> \ud83d\udcb0: Editing channel detail comes with fees. A channel owner who wishes to update his channel detail later must deposit pre-defined fees in the protocol in order to be able to edit their channel description, name, or logo. Most importantly, this fee shall keep increasing every time the channel owner makes a new edit in his/her channel details.\\n\\nThe Rationale Behind\u2026\\n\\nIn order to understand the above-mentioned details in a better manner, it\'s best to get some clarity on the reason behind those two procedures.\\n\\nIdeally, editing and modifying channel details repeatedly is not a behavior that should be encouraged. Editing and modifying channel details give the power to any malicious channel owner to change the name of their channel to a more popular defi or governance channel, in order to gain subscribers and this shall be a wrong practice.\\n\\nThe above-mentioned procedures allow the users and subscribers to get a clear and transparent detail about a channel\u2019s old details, even if the channel owner changes it later.\\n\\nMoreover, the strict requirement of fees for editing channel details and increasing the fees with every new edit penalizes and discourages the channel owner to edit important channel details time and again.\\n\\n### 4. Functionalities for Wallet-To-Wallet Feature\\n\\nThe Wallet-to-Wallet (W2W) chat feature is one of our major milestones of this year and an incredibly interesting feature for the entire Web3 world.\\n\\nThe new version of our smart contracts shall also include the crucial functions in order to implement this feature adequately in our protocol.\\n\\nAs per the current discussions & plans around this feature, any user shall be able to use the wallet to wallet, chat feature on our protocol, with a particular number of addresses. However, if the user wishes to expand his/her boundaries for W2W interaction, they can choose to activate themselves on our EPNS Smart contracts by depositing a specific sum of $PUSH Tokens. This shall ensure that the user can use the W2W chat feature with any number of wallets throughout the web3 world.\\n\\n### 5. On-Chain Governance \u2014 a major step towards our Progressive Decentralized Governance\\n\\nSince the launch of our EPNS Governance, it can undoubtedly be stated that EPNS wholeheartedly believes in the significance & power of a progressive decentralized governance system.\\n\\nConsidering the current scenario, while the EPNS community is actively participating in different governance frameworks like the Weekly Rockstar NFT, Grants program, etc, we shall have a similar procedure for the further development & upgrades of our smart contracts as well.\\n\\nAs it has already been shared with the community that during the [last security audit by ChainSafe](https://epns.io/EPNS-Protocol-Audit2021.pdf), the EPNS Governance contracts were also audited and qualified for the entire security audit procedure.\\n\\nTherefore, one of the most significant plans for this year\'s roadmap items is to initiate our On-Chain governance procedures. This shall ensure that the EPNS community will be capable of participating in the decision-making process for the inclusion of any new features in the contracts, upgrades of the contract to newer versions as well as the overall growth of the protocol.\\n\\nMoreover, some of the imperative functionalities of the current EPNS Core contract like blocking a channel permanently, verifying a channel, or revoking a channel\u2019s verification shall also be handled via the on-chain governance procedure itself."},{"id":"epns-collaborates-with-tokenbrice","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-collaborates-with-tokenbrice","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-07-epns-collaborates-with-tokenbrice/index.md","title":"EPNS Collaborates With TokenBrice to Bring Decentralized Push Notifications to Readers","description":"EPNS Collaborates With TokenBrice to Bring Decentralized Push Notifications to Readers","date":"2022-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Defi","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/defi"}],"readingTime":1.3333333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-collaborates-with-tokenbrice","title":"EPNS Collaborates With TokenBrice to Bring Decentralized Push Notifications to Readers","description":"EPNS Collaborates With TokenBrice to Bring Decentralized Push Notifications to Readers","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"EPNS and the DeFi-focused educational blog TokenBrice join hands in a strategic collaboration to bring decentralized push notifications for readers.

Today we\u2019re happy to share that this offer will be available to a wider set of users for a longer period of time. Details below.\\n\\n- Reduced minimum token holding for eligibility from 250 $PUSH to 100.\\n- The eligibility period has been extended for the whole month of April.\\n\\nAll other details will remain the same as of now.\\n\\n## Vote Delegation\\n\\nVote delegation is a novel feature that is enabled in the PUSH token contract, keeping in mind the idea to grow a strong community that acts in the best interest of the protocol. `PUSH` allows its token holders to **delegate** their voting rights to an address of their choice.\\n\\nVote delegation is creating a strong barrier for the majority of token holders as it requires ETH to cover gas-fee to execute the `delegate` on-chain transaction.\\n\\nAs the DAO landscape is going through immense experimentation and innovation to address the pressing problems, we came up with the **Gasless Vote Delegation** feature as a solution to voter apathy. We launched the feature a month ago and would like to share our insights and feedback received since its release.\\n\\n## Gasless Delegation\\n\\nThe goal of this initiative is to make voting an accessible activity to every PUSH token holder. Holders currently have a few ways to activate their voting power, and many of those ways are already incentivized with users receiving $PUSH token rewards!\\n\\nWith this feature token holders can delegate their voting power, free of gas cost. From our PUSH Governance dashboard, a token holder would just have to sign the delegate transaction.\\n\\nAs this feature rollout was an experiment, we took precautions from exploitations by enabling few barriers.\\n\\n- This feature is accessible to everyone holding at least 250 PUSH.\\n- A unique wallet address would be able to use the gasless delegation feature once in 7 days.\\n\\n## How to implement Gasless Vote Delegation\\n\\nAfter the implementation of the Gasless Vote Delegation, we see this to be a much better delegation architecture for holders than them delegating votes on-chain. Hence we are releasing this article & making the repositories public so that any DAOs out there could explore & implement the feature without much difficulty.\\n\\n**A high-level overview of the steps involved for a delegator**\\n\\n1.  Click on _Delegate_ from [Push Governance Dashboard](https://incentives.epns.io/)\\n2.  Sign the delegate parameters needed for _delegateBySig_ contract function\\n3.  The backend verifies the signature by leveraging EIP712 & does the backend checks.\\n4.  The backend wallet pays for the transaction.\\n\\nEIP-712 is a more advanced and safer signature method. It is a standard for hashing and signing typed structured data. Gasless delegation is implemented using EIP-712.\\n\\n## How the frontend works\\n\\n[Frontend repository](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-incentives-dapp)\\n\\n1.  Sign the delegate parameters needed for _delegateBySig_ contract function\\n\\n```\\nconst domain = {\\n name: contractName,\\n chainId: chainId,\\n verifyingContract: contractAddress\\n}const types = {\\n Delegation: \\\\[\\n  { name: \\"delegatee\\", type: \\"address\\" },\\n  { name: \\"nonce\\", type: \\"uint256\\" },\\n  { name: \\"expiry\\", type: \\"uint256\\" },\\n \\\\]\\n}const value = {\\n \'delegatee\': newDelegatee.toString(),\\n \'nonce\': nonce.toString(),\\n \'expiry\': expiry.toString()\\n}signature = await signerObject.\\\\_signTypedData(domain, types, value);\\n```\\n\\n2\\\\. Check whether the gasEstimate for the transaction is less than or equal to GAS_LIMIT.\\n\\n```\\nconst gasPrice = await EPNSCoreHelper.getGasPriceInDollars(library);\\nconst totalCost = gasPrice \\\\* gasEstimate;\\nif(totalCost > GAS\\\\_LIMIT){\\n return \\"Gas Price is too high, Please try again in a while.\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n3\\\\. Call the Delegate API\\n\\n```\\nawait postReq(\\"/gov/gasless\\\\_delegate\\", { delegator: account, signature: signature, delegatee: delegatee, nonce: nonce.toString(), expiry: expiry })\\n```\\n\\n## How the backend works\\n\\n[Backend repository](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-incentives-backend)\\n\\nOnce the incentives frontend triggers the Delegate API, the following conditions are checked before proceeding to pay for the delegation from the backend wallet.\\n\\n1.  ETH balance of the backend wallet must be greater than the WALLET_THRESHOLD\\n\\n```\\nbalance > WALLET\\\\_THRESHOLD\\n```\\n\\n2\\\\. PUSH Balance of the delegator must be greater than the PUSH_THRESHOLD\\n\\n```\\npushBalance > PUSH\\\\_THRESHOLD\\n```\\n\\n3\\\\. The delegator must not have attempted the Gasless Delegation feature in the past 7 days.\\n\\n```\\ndays > 7\\n```\\n\\nOnce these conditions are met, the delegation transaction is initiated from the backend wallet.\\n\\n1.  Split the signature and extract v, r & s\\n2.  Initiate the _delegateBySig_ contract call\\n\\n**Note:** We released this feature on an experimental basis. Please DYOR before implementing this feature."},{"id":"the-all-new-epns-dapp-ui","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/the-all-new-epns-dapp-ui","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-05-the-all-new-epns-dapp-ui/index.md","title":"The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here","description":"The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here","date":"2022-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 5, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Dapps","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/dapps"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"}],"readingTime":4.096666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-all-new-epns-dapp-ui","title":"The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here","description":"The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Q1 has ended and we\u2019ve made significant progress in our roadmap items during this first quarter of 2022!\\nWe planned quite a few essential tasks for the QA of 2022, but, the most interesting and crucial one was the redesign of our dApp UI.","tags":["Ethereum","Web3","Dapps","Blockchain","Newsletter"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to Implement Gasless Vote Delegation \u2014 A novel feature for Governance","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/how-to-implement-gasless-vote"},"nextItem":{"title":"Roadmap 2022 \u2014 Q1 Wrap up","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/roadmap-q1-wrap-up"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nQ1 has ended and we\u2019ve made significant progress in our roadmap items during this first quarter of 2022!\\n\\nWe planned quite a few essential tasks for the QA of 2022, but, the most interesting and crucial one was the redesign of our dApp UI.\\n\\nAnd viola!\\n\\nWe are really excited to announce the release of our **brand new User Interface.**\\n\\n![First image of The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nChannel Dashboard in the new user interface\\n\\nAfter a few internal discussions and taking in some valuable community feedback, our dev team has worked real hard on redesigning the dApp interface to enhance the user experience and provide some really effective features at the same time.\\n\\nLet\u2019s dive-in, in and get a brief idea of what\u2019s new in the dApp and explore some of its cool features.\\n\\n## TLDR;\\n\\nSome of the important new features in the dApp are as follows:\\n\\n**a. Merge of Incentive dApps**\\n\\n**b. Merge of Governance Section**\\n\\n**c. Notifications Search and Filter**\\n\\n**d. The Developers Section**\\n\\n**d. Dynamic User journey**\\n\\n**e. Olvy Integrations for announcements & releases**\\n\\n**f. A specific section for the SPAM Box**\\n\\n**g. The In-Demand & Beautiful DARK Mode theme \ud83c\udf17**\\n\\n**h. Beautified and Enhanced UX design**\\n\\nWhile these are the features that are currently available on the main EPNS dApp, there are a couple of more really interesting ones that are in the works and will be launched eventually.\\n\\n## The Merge of Governance & Incentives dApp\\n\\nWith our new UI, the navigation experience through our multiple other dApp is now a lot more effective.\\n\\nAlso, the EPNS dApp now includes the Governance section and allows a user to seamlessly navigate and _explore the EPNS governance world, check their voting power or initiate the voting delegation process to other community members, etc._\\n\\nSimilarly, users can now interact with the incentives dApp as well, right from the main EPNS dApp without the need to switch between multiple tabs on your browser.\\n\\n## Notification Search & Filter\\n\\nNotifications are important, undoubtedly. However, given the fact that the _Web3 world never sleeps \ud83d\ude00,_ there could be a scenario where your inbox is loaded with different notifications.\\n\\nTherefore, in order to provide additional power to the users and make their lives much easier, the new user interface also comes with a notification search and filter option.\\n\\n![Second image of The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n<ImageText>Notification Search and Filter</ImageText>\\n\\nThis feature enables the user to search for very specific notifications they would like to see.\\n\\nAdditionally, the UI provides the users with different kinds of filters that they can easily apply to their notifications.\\n\\n- **_Notifications based on Channels:_** This allows the users to search for notifications that were sent out by a particular channel.\\n- **_Search by keyword:_** With this filter in place, users can directly search for any notifications based on keywords within a specific notification.\\n- **_Start Date_:** Notifications can be filtered out from any given start date.\\n- **_End Date_:** Notifications can be filtered out from any given end date\\n\\n## Inbox VS Spam Box\\n\\nUnlike the previous user interface, the new one has specific sections for your **inbox** and **spambox** respectively.\\n\\nMost of you might already know, that the notifications from channels that a user is not subscribed to shall land in the Spam Box. This spam box shall now be a different page where all notifications from unsubscribed channels could be seen.\\n\\nHowever, the spam box shall also include an opt-in button for every notification which technically allows the user to opt-in to a channel, even from a spam box, if they find the notifications useful or interesting.\\n\\n![Third image of The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here](./image-3.webp)\\n\\n## Developer Section\\n\\nWhile the creation of a channel is an important step for you to set up your service and start sending notifications, it\'s not a mandatory step. A user who is simply interested in receiving notifications of the web3 world is only required to opt-in to his/her favorite channel and that\u2019s it.\\n\\nTherefore, in order to avoid confusion on this specific part, the new interface shall include a separate section for services and developers to set up their channels.\\n\\nMoreover, the developer section, as of now, shall include 3 important parts:\\n\\n- **_Main Channel Creation page_**: This shall be the main channel creation page where the users will have to deposit the required amount and pay for the gas(_the real ether \ud83d\ude00_). Channel creation on this page shall ensure that your channel is now created in the production environment and is live on the EPNS Core smart contract.\\n- **_Test Channel Creation page_**: However, in order to get a clear understanding of how the channel creation process works, the developer section of the dApp shall also include a test channel page. This shall not be connected to Ethereum mainnet but with the Kovan testnet and hence no real fees shall be involved in the process. Hence, this can be used as a test playground to understand the different steps involved in channel creation. Once the developer is confident enough, they can go ahead and create a real channel on the main page.\\n- **_Developer Docs_**: Documentation can be of great help to get a better understanding of any piece of software. Hence, the developer section, being comparatively more technical than all other sections of the dApp shall also include the developer documentation link.\\n\\n![Fourth image of The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here](./image-4.webp)\\n\\n<ImageText>Developer Section in dApp</ImageText>\\n\\n## Dynamic User Journey\\n\\nNavigating through a decentralized application can be tough, and we certainly understand that.\\n\\nKeeping this in mind, we have included an extensive and dynamic user journey in our new dApp. Starting from basic introductions to receiving notifications on your device, this walk-through feature shall guide you through all of it.\\n\\nAlthough our user interface is minimalist and incredibly simple to navigate, the user can choose to go through this dynamic user journey as much as they to get a better understanding of what each component of the dApp does.\\n\\nThis is also built, considering the fact, that not every user is a web3 expert and we wholeheartedly want to enhance the user experience of new web3 users with our simple and intuitive dApp design.\\n\\n## Olvy Integrations\\n\\nAs an additional feature, we also included the Olvy integrations with both of our dApp, i.e., [prod](https://app.epns.io/) and [staging](http://staging-app.epns.io/).\\n\\nEvery new release, announcement, and important development shall now be beautifully shared via olvy and directly appear on the dApp itself.\\n\\n## The Dark Mode\\n\\nLast but not the least, the **Dapp** now has the incredibly beautiful dark mode as well.\\n\\n_I might be slightly more inclined towards the dark theme, but, who isn\u2019t?_\\n\\n# Wrapping it Up\\n\\nAll in all, I\u2019d like to say, this has been a great start to the new year!\\n\\nI mean given so many developments across the incentives and governance bit, being able to search and filter notifs better and of course the remarkable display and design updates!\\n\\nI think it has given an impetus to how we\u2019ve tried to better the overall experience and of course, we\u2019re looking to soar higher and higher from hereon!\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited about Q2!

Notional Finance is DeFi\u2019s leading fixed-rate protocol enabling users to borrow or lend at fixed rates for up to one year \u2014 with longer maturities coming soon.\\n\\n# How Will Notional Finance Users Benefit\\n\\nThanks to the new integration, an official channel on the EPNS platform will be created that Notional Finance users can easily subscribe to. Through EPNS\u2019 mobile application, decentralized application, or Chrome Extension, Notional Finance users can choose to receive notifications whenever:\\n\\n- **Their portfolio approaches liquidation**. This will allow users to decide if they want to add more collateral to their borrow position in order to avoid potential liquidations.\\n- **One of their loans reaches maturity**. This will allow users to actively decide if they\u2019d like to close their borrow before maturity or to actively roll it forward to the next maturity and thus avoid incurring any penalties.\\n\\nWith fixed rate borrowing and lending available to increasingly-longer periods, busy DeFi users may need an extra \u201cpush\u201d to remember important milestones and important liquidation levels. This integration fills this need and allows for an enhanced experience and peace of mind for Notional users.EPNS provides a reliable communication mechanism that delivers real-time loan updates to users while preserving anonymity and privacy. EPNS is happy to support Notional users on their investing journey and to collaborate with Shippooor DAO to bring this integration to life.\\n\\n# **About Notional Finance**\\n\\nNotional is a protocol on Ethereum that facilitates fixed-rate, fixed-term crypto-asset lending and borrowing through a novel financial instrument called fCash. Notional is now a top 10 DeFi lending protocol, with more than $500M in total value locked and $375M+ in loan volume.\\n\\n| [Website](https://notional.finance/) | [Blog](https://blog.notional.finance/) | [Docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v2/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NotionalFinance) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/UNawHBQxw6)\\n\\n# **About Shippooor DAO**\\n\\nShippooor DAO is a DeFi consulting firm built by shippooors for shippooors.

As such, users of the platform are poised to receive updates about everything Flipside Crypto right on their devices.\\n\\nBlockchain technology, as a pivotal part of the next industrial revolution, has been growing from strength to strength in the last decade. Today, this technology is the cornerstone for the crypto, decentralized finance, web3, and NFT-metaverse industries. And just like the internet, user interactions within the blockchain space create a large amount of user data. This data is an invaluable resource to understand consumer behavior within the industry to create user-centric blockchain applications going forward.\\n\\nHowever, in its current state, the blockchain industry lacks a reliable analytics and query protocol that developers can source their data from. Enter Flipside Crypto. This novel blockchain protocol has been making major strides in the crypto-analytics realm with community-driven, incentivized insights.\\n\\n# On-Demand Analytics Through Structured Bounty Programs\\n\\nFlipside Crypto is a community-driven crypto analytics platform that allows users to create and share data-backed insights for the projects that interest them. In doing so, the platform provides rich pre-modeled blockchain data that anyone can use to build futuristic applications for this emerging industry. On Flipside Crypto, developers can raise queries for the analytics and data they require about a platform and regular users of that platform can answer these queries with their unique insights.\\n\\nThese on-demand insights are incentivized through the platform\u2019s structured bounty programs based on feedback from the protocol in question and community members. This means that users who take time to learn about their favorite blockchain protocols can get paid to do so and eventually level up to become \u201cSQL Superstars\u201d.\\n\\nFlipside Crypto has already partnered with blockchain networks and protocols like Solana, ThorChain, and ParaSwap, among others to make their on-chain data easily available for use.\\n\\nNow, given the community-driven nature of the platform, it is vital for Flipside Crypto to have a robust communication mechanism through which it can constantly keep its users in the loop. And this is where the collaboration with EPNS comes into play.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail?\\n\\nThe collaboration aims to create an official medium of communication between the users and Flipside Crypto to help them communicate on important aspects of the protocol. Flipside Crypto will soon have an official channel on the EPNS platform that can be subscribed to. Users who subscribe to the channel will receive direct notifications from Flipside Crypto about any platform update, as and when it occurs.\\n\\nEPNS has a mobile application, decentralized application, and a chrome extension to ensure that users do not miss out on these notifications no matter what device they\u2019re on.\\n\\nAs Flipside continues to facilitate the growth of the blockchain space through rich data-driven insights on consumer behavior, we\u2019re pleased to collaborate with them on this journey and hope to become an integral part of their operations.\\n\\n# **About Flipside Crypto**\\n\\nFlipside provides Community Enabled Crypto Analytics, allowing our users to create and share data insights on the crypto projects they care most about. Through dashboard and visualization tools, as well as auto-generated API endpoints, data analysts can easily create queries that answer any question.\\n\\nStay in touch! | [Website](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/) | [Blog](https://blog.flipsidecrypto.com/) |"},{"id":"epns-at-ethdenver-2022-a-throwback","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-at-ethdenver-2022-a-throwback","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-21-epns-at-ethdenver-2022-a-throwback/index.md","title":"EPNS at ETHDenver 2022: A Throwback","description":"EPNS at ETHDenver 2022: A Throwback","date":"2022-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 21, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethdenver","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethdenver"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Ethereum Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum-blockchain"},{"label":"Conference","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/conference"}],"readingTime":2.0633333333333335,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-at-ethdenver-2022-a-throwback","title":"EPNS at ETHDenver 2022: A Throwback","description":"EPNS at ETHDenver 2022: A Throwback","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Flipside Crypto, the project enabling communities to share data-driven insights on blockchain projects, joins forces with EPNS to bring decentralized push notifications to its users.

The protocol went live on [Ethereum Mainnet on Jan 11th](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/the-epns-mainnet-is-here-470faec0c01) and it now has 19 official channels by major projects in Web3 including ENS, MakerDAO, Coindesk and dYdX.\\n\\nAny service, protocol, or individual who wants to include the functionality to include notifications in their dApp could follow this guide. **In this post, we\u2019ve made it easy to learn how to get started.**\\n\\n# EPNS Integration\\n\\nThe initial step for EPNS integration is **channel creation**. Here is the [**step-by-step guide on how to create a channel**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/getting-started-with-epns-ca2dd7f43329).\\n\\nOnce the channel is created, the channel owner could start sending notifications from the dApp and receive notifications on all of the EPNS platforms \u2014 dApp, Android App, iOS App, Browser Extension, and the users would have to subscribe on our dApp, but after this integration, you would be able to perform that very functionality on your dApp.\\n\\n# Integrating with the Frontend SDK\\n\\nFront-end SDK allows developers & protocols to integrate the notifications to their dApp or mobile app, we would specifically be focusing on the channel module of it.\\n\\nThis module comprises of three sub-modules majorly:\\n\\n- Opt in and out to a channel from the SDK\\n- Fetching the details of a channel by using it\u2019s address as an identifier.\\n- Find out if a user is subscribed to a channel.\\n\\nHere is how you can integrate your React Frontend Dapp with EPNS Decentralized notification service:\\n\\n**Step 1:** Install the npm package\\n\\n```\\nnpm install @epnsproject/frontend-sdk\\n```\\n\\n## Subscribing to the channel\\n\\n**Step 2:** Import the channels module from the package.\\n\\n```\\nimport { channels } from \\"@epnsproject/frontend-sdk-staging\\";\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3:** Define the required variables to make a request to fetch some notifications!\\n\\n```\\nconst { library, active, account, chainId } = useWeb3React();const signer = library.getSigner(account); //this could also be any entity which has a method \\\\`\\\\_signTypedData(domain, type, message)\\\\` which is capable of signing messages using eip 712.const channelAddress = \\"0x94c3016ef3e503774630fC71F59B8Da9f7D470B7\\"; //the address of the channel we want to op-in to or opt-out fromconst chainId = 1; //this is for the ethereum network, and can be any of out supported chains.const userAddress = \\"0x57c1D4dbFBc9F8cB77709493cc43eaA3CD505432\\";\\n```\\n\\nit is worth noting that the \\\\*signer\\\\* variable could be gotten through other means, for more information on the signer object, please refer to [this article.](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer)\\n\\n**Step 4:** Opt in-to or out-of the channel!\\n\\n```\\nconst epnsSubscribe = () => {\\n     await channels.optIn(\\n         [signer](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/),\\n         channelAddress,\\n         chainId,\\n         userAddress,\\n         {\\n            onSuccess: () => \\"so something\\"  // do something after success\\n         }\\n    )}\\nconst epnsUnSubscribe = () => {\\n     await channels.optOut(\\n         [signer](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/),\\n         channelAddress,\\n         chainId,\\n         userAddress,\\n         {\\n            onSuccess: () => \\"do something\\"  // do something after success\\n         }\\n    )}\\n```\\n\\n## Step 5:\\n\\nCheck if the user is subscribed to the current channel, in order to know if to subscribe to the user or unsubscribe them.\\n\\n```\\nconst \\\\[isSubscribed, setIsSubscribed\\\\] = useState(false);\\nchannels.isUserSubscribed(userAddress, channelAddress)\\n.then((res) => {\\n      setIsSubscribed(res);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Putting it all together\\n\\n**Step 6:** Finally, we proceed to combine all the above into a coherent code.\\n\\n```\\nimport { useEffect, useState } from \\"react\\";\\nimport { useWeb3React } from \\"[@web3](http://twitter.com/web3)\\\\-react/core\\";\\nimport { channels } from \\"[@epnsproject/frontend-sdk-staging](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-sdk)\\";\\nimport ConnectButton from \\"./components/connect\\";\\nimport \\"./App.scss\\";const CHANNEL\\\\_ADDRESS = \\"0x94c3016ef3e503774630fC71F59B8Da9f7D470B7\\";function App() {\\n  const { library, active, account, chainId } = useWeb3React();// create state components to fetch all the notifications.\\n  const \\\\[isSubscribed, setIsSubscribed\\\\] = useState(false);// channel details\\n  const \\\\[channel, setChannel\\\\] = useState(null);\\n  // load channel details on start\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n    if (!account) return;\\n    // on page load, fetch channel details\\n    channels.getChannelByAddress(CHANNEL\\\\_ADDRESS).then((data) => {\\n      setChannel(data);\\n    });\\n    // fetch if user is subscribed to channel\\n    channels.isUserSubscribed(account, CHANNEL\\\\_ADDRESS).then((res) => {\\n      console.log(res);\\n      setIsSubscribed(res);\\n    });\\n  }, \\\\[account\\\\]);const epnsSubscribe = () => {\\n     await channels.optIn(\\n         [signer](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/),\\n         channelAddress,\\n         chainId,\\n         userAddress,\\n         {\\n            onSuccess: () => \\"so something\\"  // do something after success\\n         }\\n    )}\\nconst epnsUnSubscribe = () => {\\n     await channels.optOut(\\n         [signer](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/),\\n         channelAddress,\\n         chainId,\\n         userAddress,\\n         {\\n            onSuccess: () => \\"do something\\"  // do something after success\\n         }\\n    )}return (\\n    <div className=\\"App\\">\\n      {/\\\\* define the header \\\\*/}\\n      <h2 className=\\"App\\\\_\\\\_header\\">\\n        <span> EPNS Playground </span>\\n        <ConnectButton />\\n      </h2>\\n      {/\\\\* define the header \\\\*/}{active ?

It provides investors with the easiest, most efficient way of gaining exposure to a wide variety of assets and asset classes. The best part is that Float Capital does away with over-collateralization of assets and in turn avoids liquidation.\\n\\nInvestors on this protocol can use DAI to mint tokens for assets like cryptocurrencies, commodities, and equities, and create a position with ease. They can hold and gain exposure to a wide variety of assets while still avoiding the risk of actually holding them.\\n\\nIn this regard, it is pivotal for the platform to have a communication medium through which it can keep users updated about various opportunities in the market and this is where EPNS comes into play.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our collaboration with Float Capital, we aim to build an official channel of communication between the users and the platform. Users will soon be able to subscribe to this channel and in doing so, they can expect to receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- There are changes in the market i.e., price changes and exposure changes\\n- New markets, new features, and new updates are added to the protocol\\n- There are gains or losses in investor positions\\n\\nThese notifications will enhance the user experience on the Float Capital platform and allow users to make the right investment decisions. We at EPNS are pleased to be on board with Float Capital and hope to be an integral part of their operations.\\n\\n# **About Float Capital**\\n\\nFloat Capital is a peer-to-peer, yield-enhanced, floating asset exposure mechanism.\\n\\nPut simply, Float is the easiest and safest way for users to buy magic internet assets. Users do not need to worry about over-collateralization, or suddenly getting liquidated. The vision of Float is to provide decentralized and trustless exposure to various asset classes.\\n\\nStay in touch!| [Website](https://float.capital/?chain=137) | [Blog](https://medium.com/@Float.Capital) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/float_capital) | [Whitepaper](https://media-float-capital.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/public/FLOAT_CAPITAL_whitepaper.pdf)"},{"id":"push-govearnance-updates","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-govearnance-updates","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-17-push-govearnance-updates/index.md","title":"Push GovEARNance Updates & Engagement Rewards Campaign","description":"Push GovEARNance Updates & Engagement Rewards Campaign","date":"2022-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 17, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Governance","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/governance"}],"readingTime":2.6,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-govearnance-updates","title":"Push GovEARNance Updates & Engagement Rewards Campaign","description":"Push GovEARNance Updates & Engagement Rewards Campaign","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Since the governance launch in September 2021, a lot of things happened in EPNS: mainnet launch in January, new partnerships, new 2022 roadmap updated, and now a new rebranding in Governance!","tags":["Ethereum","Newsletter","Blockchain","Epnsproject","Governance"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EPNS Collaborates With Float Capital to Bring Push Notifications to Magic Internet Assets","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-collaborates-with-float-capital"},"nextItem":{"title":"Token-Gated Channel for Our Rockstar Community","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/token-gated-channel-for-our-rockstar-community"}},"content":"import { ImageText, VideoContainer } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of Push GovEARNance Updates & Engagement Rewards Campaign](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nSince the [governance launch](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-governance-goes-live-lets-push-for-progressive-decentralized-governance-7448b58b89b4) in September 2021, a lot of things happened in EPNS: mainnet launch in January, new partnerships, new 2022 roadmap updated, and now a new rebranding in Governance!\\n\\nWe have been putting a lot of effort into creating a new face for the Governance so we can make it even easier to participate in building the future of web3 notifications.\\n\\nSince the beginning, EPNS has always taken community very seriously.

By focusing their unique talents however they saw fit, users could tag their submissions on Twitter with **#RockstarsofEPNS** for a chance to win the weekly prize and title.\\n\\nEvery week for the past year the Push Governance team (led by Miss Walter) chose 4 submissions weekly and then gave $PUSH holders the chance to vote on the nominees through our Snapshot voting page. The weekly prize for best submission was then entitled to 2400 $PUSH and an EPNS-inspired NFT created by our local Indian community.\\n\\nTo date, we have paid out ~120,000 $PUSH along with 50 unique NFTs to our Rockstar winners!

As a result of this collaboration, users are poised to receive decentralized push notifications directly to their devices when new airdrops are available to claim.\\n\\nFrom DeFi\u2019s very inception airdrop campaigns have been a foolproof way for businesses in the industry to market themselves. By sending out a share of their total token supply directly to the wallets of community members for free, businesses not only ensured active user participation but also gave them a way to benefit from the overall growth of the project. This novel marketing tactic is vastly successful within the DeFi industry and became a doorway for new users to enter this space without any initial investment.\\n\\nHowever, given the monumental growth of DeFi in the past couple of years, the industry is now swarming with thousands of new projects with vast potential. It is practically impossible for DeFi enthusiasts to keep a track of all available airdrop opportunities, and as a result, end up missing out on potential ones. This is precisely why Earnifi was built.\\n\\n### The Need for an Airdrop Aggregator\\n\\nEarnifi is an effective new DeFi tool that aggregates all available airdrops across different blockchain networks on a single platform to ensure that DeFi users do not miss out on any claim they might be eligible for. In a simple two-step process, the platform allows users to enter their wallet addresses and access all available claims in an instant.\\n\\nEarnifi has its wings spread across multiple major blockchain networks including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon, ensuring that users do not miss out on any opportunities in these budding ecosystems. As of now, Earnifi uses centralized email services to notify users about all these opportunities. However, given the obvious path towards decentralization, Earnifi has teamed up with EPNS to ensure direct communication with users without the need for centralized external media.\\n\\n\u201cWe are keen on ensuring decentralization in every aspect and as such, we believe that decentralized platforms need a decentralized communication system,\u201d says the team at Earnifi. \u201cEPNS successfully eliminates the need for DeFi protocols to depend on centralized solutions like mail or social media, while building direct communication between the protocol and users. We\u2019re thrilled about the collaboration and can\u2019t wait for our users to reap its benefits.\u201d\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough this pilot collaboration, EPNS and Earnifi are building an official decentralized communication medium between the platform and its users. Earnifi will have a verified channel on the EPNS platform. Subscribers of this channel will receive push notifications when new airdrops associated with their wallet address are available to claim. Given the limited timeframe for airdrops, a push notification service like this could ensure that eligible users claim their share before it\u2019s too late.\\n\\n\u201cEarnifi is a blessing in disguise for active DeFi users looking to get their hands on airdrop claims. The DeFi industry gives out millions of dollars in airdrops and without a proper communication channel, most of these opportunities go in vain. In this regard, EPNS through its collaboration with Earnifi ensures that users are constantly updated and can make the most of this opportunity,\u201d says Harsh Rajat, Co-founder of EPNS\\n\\nEPNS has a chrome extension, a decentralized application, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss these notifications on any device.\\n\\n# **About Earnifi**\\n\\nEarniFi was created by [DeFi Dawson](https://twitter.com/DawsonBotsford) and allows users to track a number of blockchains including Ethereum, [Binance Smart Chain](https://everybithelps.co.uk/binance-smart-chain-to-metamask//), [Polygon](https://everybithelps.co.uk/connect-polygon-to-metamask/) addresses for airdrops. Some airdrops will often have an expiration date and after which time, you lose the opportunity to claim your free crypto. However, Earnifi solves this by notifying users when they have an airdrop available to claim.

As a result of this collaboration, investors on RealT\u2019s platform will soon receive updates about upcoming sales, token delivery, and rent delivery. Additional use cases will be implemented along the way.\\n\\nAmong the many applications of the emergent blockchain technology, tokenization of real-world assets is the one that draws attention from the global markets. Indeed, tokens on the blockchain allow to store value and information in a secure and verifiable manner. Now, by leveraging this technology and attaching a real-world asset to it, it becomes easy to prove the value, ownership, and rarity of the asset.\\n\\nThis is especially useful in the real estate industry where there\u2019s limited transparency, the use cases for fraud, forgery, and duplicity of documents. By tokenizing real-estate on the blockchain, not only are these fraudulent practices eliminated but it also opens doors for anyone to invest in property globally. With this very aim launched RealT, the firm tokenizing a company which held the property as an asset.\\n\\n### Tokenized Real Estate\\n\\nAs mentioned before, RealT is a platform issuing security tokens that interact with DEFI projects. It essentially turns the ownership of property into digital tokens that retain all the legal rights and protections that are offered by traditional ownership. It opens up new dimensions in the world of real estate by allowing investors across the globe to tap into the US real estate market.\\n\\nRealT offers a specially curated list of properties to its community of users and they can invest as much or as little as they want. Token holders receive the rent through the blockchain and can sell anytime without any hassle. RealT\u2019s visions have been lauded by the market and the project has seen substantial success so far.\\n\\nWith the development of its ecosystem and different up-coming use cases, RealT wanted to bring decentralized push notification to its users. In this regard, RealT needs a proper communication channel that allows the platform to keep its users updated on different status of the coming sales, tokens and rent delivery. And through this collaboration, we aim to build this communication channel for RealT.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail?\\n\\nAs a result of our pilot collaboration, RealT will have an official channel on the EPNS platform. Users who choose to subscribe to this channel will get directly connected for seamless communication in a decentralized manner. They can receive push notifications about the various happenings on the platform.\\n\\nAs RealT continues to revolutionize the real estate industry, we are pleased to collaborate with them to ensure the smooth running of their processes in an effort to improve the network. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of the RealT network.\\n\\n# **About RealToken (RealT)**\\n\\nRealT is a platform which allows investors around the globe to buy into the real estate market through fully-compliant, fractional, tokenized ownership. RealToken reinvented traditional real estate ownership by providing investors a simple, intelligent, and user-friendly method to buy a property, leveraging the US legal system through an LLC or Inc structure. RealT establishes an LLC or Inc for each property, and tokenizes those interests into security offerings. Currently, RealT\u2019s real estate offerings are based in the US, but has plans in the near-term to expand globally."},{"id":"epns-introduces-gasless-march","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-introduces-gasless-march","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-03-epns-introduces-gasless-march/index.md","title":"EPNS Introduces Gasless March\u2014 Gas-free $PUSH Delegation \u274c\u26fd\ufe0f & Reward Drop Proposal for Push Governance Community.","description":"EPNS Introduces Gasless March\u2014 Gas-free $PUSH Delegation \u274c\u26fd\ufe0f & Reward Drop Proposal for Push Governance Community.","date":"2022-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 3, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Governance","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/governance"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Delegation","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/delegation"},{"label":"Ethereum Gas Fee","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum-gas-fee"}],"readingTime":4.3933333333333335,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-introduces-gasless-march","title":"EPNS Introduces Gasless March\u2014 Gas-free $PUSH Delegation \u274c\u26fd\ufe0f & Reward Drop Proposal for Push Governance Community.","description":"EPNS Introduces Gasless March\u2014 Gas-free $PUSH Delegation \u274c\u26fd\ufe0f & Reward Drop Proposal for Push Governance Community.","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"EPNS and Earnifi, DeFi\u2019s newest airdrop aggregator platform, team up in a pilot collaboration to enable direct communication between users and the platform.

EPNS is going to cover gas fees for PUSH holders to delegate their votes on-chain.\\n2.  Governance users then have immediate voting power to weigh in on the PIP (Push Improvement Proposal) for Reward Drop to Push Gov users, both existing & new.\\n3.  Throughout the month of March, all users who take advantage of the Gasless period to delegate their tokens in Push Governance will be eligible for a 100 $PUSH Reward Drop. A total of 30 winners will be chosen randomly among all who delegate between March 2 \u2014 March 31.\\n\\nThe goal of this initiative is to make voting an accessible activity to every PUSH token holder. Users currently have a few ways to activate their voting power, and many of those ways are already incentivized with users receiving $PUSH token rewards! For those who prefer to delegate their votes over staking for yield, the gas fees incurred to do so are a consideration. This initiative will mitigate that fee for a large chunk of holders for a limited time.\\n\\nMore **\ud83d\udc47**\\n\\n# $PUSH Governance Voting Power \ud83d\udd14\ud83d\uddf3\\n\\nThe EPNS Community currently can take part in Push Governance by submitting a PIP (Push Improvement Proposal) or through the **Push Grants Program \u2014 now LIVE and accepting grant submissions** [**here**](https://gov.epns.io/c/grants/)**.** The formal voting for both is done on Snapshot where the [Push Voting Strategy](https://snapshot.org/#/strategy/push-voting-power) enables the following groups to vote:\\n\\n- $PUSH holders who delegate (to themselves or a Delegatee) on the [Push Governance delegation page](https://incentives.epns.io).\\n\\n![First image of EPNS Introduces Gasless March\u2014 Gas-free $PUSH Delegation \u274c\u26fd\ufe0f & Reward Drop Proposal for Push Governance Community.](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n- Users staking their $PUSH tokens or Uniswap LP stake tokens in either of the EPNS [Yield Farms](https://incentives.epns.io)\\n\\n![Second image of EPNS Introduces Gasless March\u2014 Gas-free $PUSH Delegation \u274c\u26fd\ufe0f & Reward Drop Proposal for Push Governance Community.](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n_We\u2019re thankful to these folks who have already activated their votes on-chain and haven\u2019t forgotten about them in this release (more below\ud83e\ude82)._\\n\\nAs of today, a majority of the total token holders (almost 90%) haven\u2019t activated their tokens to vote yet. This initiative aims to remove the largest barrier to entry for our holders so their token\u2019s utility is activated and their voting weight is enabled.\\n\\n# **Gasless Delegation\u274c\u26fd\ufe0f Specifics**\\n\\nFor a limited time, EPNS is going to cover the gas costs for a large group of these token holders who haven\'t delegated. This should make the ability to participate more accessible, by making it free!\\n\\nThe development team has been working on this behind the scenes and today opened up the [backend repo](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-incentives-backend) to the public. This feature release allows the EPNS project team to cover the gas fees for delegators when they initiate the transaction on-chain.\\n\\n> **_Who\u2019s eligible?_**\\n>\\n> Addresses holding at least 250 $PUSH or more.\\n>\\n> **_For how long?_**\\n>\\n> The program will be open initially for 30 days (Mar 2, 2022 \u2014 Mar 31, 2022)\\n>\\n> **_Transaction limits?_**\\n>\\n> One delegate transaction in 7 days per eligible address , gas fees cannot exceed $50 per delegation transaction\\n\\n## How to Delegate?\\n\\n1.  Hop into [https://incentives.epns.io/](https://incentives.epns.io/) Push Governance dashboard\\n2.  Select the way to delegate. There are 2 ways to delegate your PUSH votes. _Gasless_ or _With Gas._ The default way is _Gasless._ If you are not eligible for Gasless Delegation, you could still select _With Gas_ option and proceed to pay for gas yourself to do the delegation.\\n3.  Clicking on `Delegate` button will pop Metamask.\\n4.  **For _Gasless_:**  \\n    Sign the transaction.  \\n    Then our backend proceeds to pay for the transaction using EIP712. Please wait for a minute or 2 for the transation to become successful.  \\n    **For _With Gas_:**  \\n    Confirm the transaction.\\n\\n![Third image of EPNS Introduces Gasless March\u2014 Gas-free $PUSH Delegation \u274c\u26fd\ufe0f & Reward Drop Proposal for Push Governance Community.](./image-3.webp)\\n\\nDelegate your PUSH votes Gaslessly or With Gas\\n\\nAs of today (at block **#14313131**) a total of 1,025 addresses are eligible to participate \u2014 which accounts for just over 25% of the nearly 4,000 $PUSH holders. Depending on the success of the first 30 days, the program duration and holdings eligibility may be reconsidered to include more users in this gasless offer.\\n\\n# Reward Drop \ud83d\udcb0\ud83e\ude82 Info\\n\\n![Fourth image of EPNS Introduces Gasless March\u2014 Gas-free $PUSH Delegation \u274c\u26fd\ufe0f & Reward Drop Proposal for Push Governance Community.](./image-4.webp)\\n\\n## PROPOSAL LIVE! [Gasless March & Governance Users Reward Drop](https://gov.epns.io/t/draft-proposal-gasless-march-and-governance-users-reward-drop/476)\\n\\n- Reimburse past tx fees of delegators\\n- Urge LP stakers to activate their token voting power\\n- 30 users who delegate during the Gasless March Gas-fee-free Delegation\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, about 10% of holders have already made the transactions necessary to vote in Push Governance. These addresses include the delegators and Yield Farmers earning PUSH rewards in the EPNS staking pools. To the handful of active addresses who have already paid these ETH gas fees and aren\u2019t earning rewards, we\u2019ve proposed a retroactive PUSH distribution to reimburse these users.\\n\\nAnother small subset of users included in this reward drop will be the LP stakers on Uniswap that haven\u2019t activated their voting power. For these holders, the way to do that is to stake into our EPNS Yield Farms. The vast majority have done so, for the few that haven\u2019t, we expect this reward drop should cover their expense to execute that transaction.\\n\\nIn addition to these reimbursement rewards, and to promote taking advantage of the Gasless Delegation feature even further, we\u2019re offering the same reward drop to a lucky few of these users as well! Even users with **less than 250 $PUSH** who _didn\u2019t qualify_ _for this gasless delegation window_ **are eligible** for this bonus drop if they delegate their tokens during the gasless offer window.\\n\\nWhile making the delegation of PUSH voting power gasless (free) for many users over these next 30 days we wanted to give users one additional incentive to drive usage of this initiative. Make it easy, make it free, and include rewards to participate\u2026 these are the steps we\u2019re taking to increase participation and combat voter apathy.\\n\\n> **_Who\u2019s eligible?_**\\n>\\n> Users that delegated prior to snapshot, either to themselves or a Delegatee\\n>\\n> Uniswap LP providers that have not activated their voting power by staking to our EPNS Yield Farms\\n>\\n> 30 random users chosen among all those that delegate their votes over the next 30 days (Mar 2, 2022 \u2014 Mar 31, 2022)\\n>\\n> **_Reward amount?_**\\n>\\n> 100 $PUSH\\n>\\n> **_How many will receive the reward drop?_**\\n>\\n> Users delegated prior to snapshot \u2014 26\\n>\\n> LP Providers yet to stake to Yield Farms \u2014 14\\n>\\n> Random selection of 30 addresses that delegate over the month of March, gaslessly or not \u2014 30\\n\\nThat\u2019s 70 addresses that will receive rewards for past delegation/LP holders to delegate, plus 30 random users chosen among those who delegate during the Gasless March Push for a Governance time window, 70 in total.\\n\\nThis is a governance proposal that is currently live for community consideration.\\n\\n# Wrap \ud83c\udf80\ud83c\udf81\\n\\nAs #PUSHgov delivers this feature to users during Gasless March we hope to attract even more interested users to the Push Governance family. The whole reasoning for this campaign was to break down barriers, recognize valuable users, and incentivize users on yet another level.\\n\\nThis Incentivized Governance Model combined with the Progressive Governance Approach we\u2019re taking will serve us well as we lead toward DAO-fication in a responsible and deliberative manner. At each step, we attract the kinds of users we want by being conservative and consistent with the rewards distro and the types of contribution channels we\u2019ve opened. Thanks for taking the ride with us and as always appreciate the community\u2019s support."},{"id":"epns-teams-up-with-the-defiant","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-teams-up-with-the-defiant","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-01-epns-teams-up-with-the-defiant/index.md","title":"EPNS Teams Up With The Defiant to Bring DeFi News Directly to Users Wallets","description":"EPNS Teams Up With The Defiant to Bring DeFi News Directly to Users Wallets","date":"2022-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 1, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Defi","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/defi"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"}],"readingTime":1.9133333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-teams-up-with-the-defiant","title":"EPNS Teams Up With The Defiant to Bring DeFi News Directly to Users Wallets","description":"EPNS Teams Up With The Defiant to Bring DeFi News Directly to Users Wallets","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"EPNS strikes a strategic collaboration with the DeFi news and media platform The Defiant, to facilitate decentralized communication between the platform and DeFi users.

As such, DeFi enthusiasts can now receive their daily dose of DeFi updates directly on their devices as decentralized push notifications.\\n\\nDeFi\u2019s monumental success is often attributed to the rapid innovations, tech developments, and high return investment opportunities that emerged from this space. But behind the scenes, DeFi\u2019s dedicated news and media outlets played an important role in DeFi\u2019s rise. By taking day-to-day updates to the masses, media companies spread education and awareness about this emerging industry ultimately setting the revolution in motion.\\n\\nOne such media outlet is The Defiant.\\n\\n# Pragmatic Journalism; Objective Information\\n\\nThe Defiant is a DeFi-centric news and media platform that curates, digests, and analyzes all the significant developments in the industry to keep readers updated at all times. It acts as a one-stop-shop for all DeFi enthusiasts to learn, research, and stay informed about the various trends in this space while closely following the growth of the industry.\\n\\nThe Defiant delivers data-backed and objective pieces of information to its readers while actively working to eliminate misinformation. However, for a platform that is primarily focused on DeFi, The Defiant lacks a decentralized communication system to take this information directly to its readers. And through this strategic collaboration, we at EPNS aim to build this system.\\n\\n\u201cThe Defiant is a platform that we at EPNS rely on to get major industry updates. The pragmatic journalism and research-backed information published on the platform helps us assess the vibe of the industry and ultimately build products that users would love to use. In this regard, we\u2019re enthralled with this collaboration with The Defiant and we hope that decentralized notifications become an integral part of its operations,\u201d says the team at EPNS, speaking about the collaboration.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThe collaboration between EPNS and The Defiant has one goal and that is to build a decentralized communication channel for the platform. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and regular readers of The Defiant can subscribe to it. When they do so, they receive updates directly to their wallets whenever new DeFi news articles are published on the platform. This eliminates the need for centralized communication services and pushed forward the DeFi revolution.\\n\\n\u201cEPNS is a very important innovation in DeFi,\u201d says the team at The Defiant. \u201cThe need for a decentralized communication system will be key and EPNS is one of the few teams building this primitive. EPNS is helping communication within the decentralized world become more efficient and transparent, and we believe our readers are poised to benefit from this system of direct communication.\u201d\\n\\nAs The Defiant continues to spread awareness about DeFi to all corners of the world, we are pleased to collaborate with them on this journey and hope to continue this alliance into the future.\\n\\n# About The Defiant\\n\\nThe Defiant curates, digests, and analyzes all the major developments in decentralized finance, so that you can stay informed and smart about the most cutting-edge and fastest-changing corner of crypto and finance.

As such, users of Nord Finance are poised to receive updates about their loan status and new investment opportunities through decentralized push notifications on their devices.\\n\\nThe DeFi industry has only grown from strength to strength since its inception in 2017. Today, it is home to some serious technological developments and rapid innovations that promise to change the course of the global financial system. However, in its current state, the industry causes a myriad of problems to its players.\\n\\nFor starters, the space is extremely fragmented and lacks interoperability. Individual blockchain ecosystems within DeFi have built walls so high that users housed on one chain often miss out on budding opportunities in the other. Then, for DeFi\u2019s most popular investment strategy of yield farming, farmer saturation often reduces the yield generated and investors find themselves jumping from platform to platform in search of better yield. The price fluctuation of crypto assets leads to impermanent loss for liquidity providers and throws them in a constant dilemma of whether to HODL or provide liquidity. Lastly, the industry lacks variety in the range of investment opportunities available and leaves average, risk-averse investors, out of the picture.\\n\\nNow, Nord Finance, as a DeFi platform was built to specifically solve these issues within the industry.\\n\\n### DeFi for the Masses\\n\\nNord Finance is a blockchain-agnostic DeFi ecosystem that aims to create a multitude of financial opportunities for users by combining the best of traditional finance with DeFi. All of these opportunities cater to investors across the spectrum and are designed to generate the highest possible yields without impermanent loss. To achieve this, Nord Finance brings stablecoins into the picture and creates additional utility for them within the DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nInvestors can use their stablecoin holdings for a wide range of opportunities from savings and fund management to collateralized loans, yield farming, and swaps on the Nord Finance platform. The interoperable nature of this platform automatically directs the liquidity to the highest yielding pools across the DeFi space to generate high APYs. This means that investors are not limited to a single platform and can bank on opportunities across the industry.\\n\\nGiven the innovative nature and the sheer number of possibilities on Nord Finance, users of this platform need a channel through which they can constantly keep a track of their investments and new opportunities. And this is exactly what we aim to achieve through our collaboration with Nord Finance.\\n\\n\u201cNord Finance is just the platform that the growing DeFi industry was in need of,\u201d says the team at EPNS. \u201cThe innovative financial products combined with the platform\u2019s interoperability make it suitable for both beginner and veteran investors entering DeFi. In this regard, we believe that EPNS can add to the existing user experience on this platform by allowing users to stay on top of their investments, loans, and new opportunities.\u201d\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThis collaboration with Nord Finance entails building a direct communication medium between the protocol and its users. Nord Finance will have an official channel on the EPNS platform through which users can receive push notifications whenever,\\n\\n- New farming opportunities or liquidity pools are available for investors.\\n- The loan repayment period approaches\\n- On-boarding period for token claiming ends.\\n\\nThis saves users the hassle of manually checking for new updates every single time. EPNS has a mobile application, decentralized application, and a chrome extension to ensure that users do not miss out on these notifications no matter what device they\u2019re on.\\n\\nSpeaking of the partnership the team at Nord Finance says, \u201cto say that EPNS has redefined communication in DeFi would be an understatement. It is a platform that is single-handedly bringing the whole of web3 closer together. We\u2019re extremely thrilled to have them on board and we believe that EPNS will help us better communicate with our users and improve their overall experience on the platform.\u201d\\n\\n# **About Nord Finance**\\n\\nNord Finance, a blockchain agnostic platform, is an advanced decentralized financial ecosystem that focuses on simplifying decentralized finance products for users by highlighting traditional finance\u2019s key attributes. Deployed on the Ethereum Network, it integrates multi-chain interoperability, thus proposing a plethora of financial primitives, which constitute savings, advisory, loans against assets, investment/funds management, and swaps.\\n\\nAt Nord Finance, we are building a one-stop advanced decentralized financial ecosystem to serve the rising needs targeting novice users and professionals to meet their financial goals.\\n\\nConnect with us\u2026\\n\\n- Join our [Telegram](https://t.me/NordFinance)\\n- Join our [Telegram Announcement](https://t.me/NordFinance_Ann)\\n- Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nord_Finance?s=09)\\n- Visit our [Website](https://nordfinance.io/)\\n- Mail us at contact@nordfinance.io"},{"id":"epns-and-lifi-team-up","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-and-lifi-team-up","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-16-epns-and-lifi/index.md","title":"EPNS and LiFi Team Up To Improve User Experience Through Push Notifications","description":"EPNS and LiFi Team Up To Improve User Experience Through Push Notifications","date":"2022-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 16, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Defi","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/defi"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"}],"readingTime":1.82,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-and-lifi-team-up","title":"EPNS and LiFi Team Up To Improve User Experience Through Push Notifications","description":"EPNS and LiFi Team Up To Improve User Experience Through Push Notifications","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Despite its monumental success over the past couple of years, the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry still largely remains to be fragmented.

Every blockchain network within the industry seems to have created walled gardens for themselves that make it difficult for users to bypass. As a result, users are usually stuck with funds on a single blockchain network, preventing them from taking advantage of opportunities across different chains.\\n\\nThis creates a lackluster user experience, hindering the full potential of DeFi and thereby its mainstream adoption. Having recognized this problem, Li.Fi, an emergent DeFi protocol, created a robust way for users to experience interoperability within DeFi. As such, we\u2019re pleased to announce our pilot collaboration with Li.Fi to provide a means of communication between the protocol and users.\\n\\n### How LiFi Can Benefit from EPNS\\n\\nLi.Fi is a cross-chain bridge aggregator protocol that allows users to swap any token for another, irrespective of their native blockchain networks. The protocol chooses the best possible bridge to move funds from one chain to the other by connecting to DEXs on both sides. This means that by simply integrating the Li.Fi SDK and API, dApps and protocols in DeFi can allow users to bypass the walled gardens of blockchain networks to conduct transactions.\\n\\nUsing Li.Fi, users will be able to take advantage of superior yield farming, staking, and investment opportunities across the DeFi ecosystem without having to constantly move from one chain to the other. This contributes to an overall better user experience for both new and veteran users and brings the fragmented DeFi space closer together, paving the way for mainstream adoption.\\n\\nNow, given that users of Li.Fi can conduct multiple cross-chain transactions, it is quite a laborious task for them to manually check for transaction confirmations. Li.Fi needs a communication channel through which it can directly update users about the status of their transactions. This is where EPNS comes into play.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our pilot partnership with Li.Fi, we aim to provide a way for the protocol to seamlessly communicate with its users without depending on external media. Users of Li.Fi will directly receive push notifications about the status of their transactions through bridges. Instead of them having to check time and again, the protocol will notify users when their assets are successfully bridged to the other side. This saves users a lot of time and effort and improves their overall user experience within DeFi.\\n\\nAs Li.Fi strives to bridge the gaps between blockchain networks, we are pleased to have partnered with them on this journey and hope to be an integral part of their operations.\\n\\n### About LiFi\\n\\nLi.Fi is a cross-chain bridge aggregation protocol that supports any-2-any cross-chain swaps by aggregating bridges and connecting them to DEXes and DEX aggregators.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, we\u2019re like 1inch & Paraswap for bridges, we choose the best bridge to move funds from one chain to another, but since bridges only support stable-coins and a few other coins, we have DEXes on both sides of the bridges to swap before and after the bridge, thus facilitating any-2-any swaps across chains.\\n\\n| [Website](https://li.finance/?fromChain=eth) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lifiprotocol) | [Medium](https://blog.li.finance/) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/lifi) | [Telegram](https://t.me/lifinews)"},{"id":"epns-and-cryptomanga-team-up","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-and-cryptomanga-team-up","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-15-epns-and-cryptomanga-team-up/index.md","title":"EPNS x CryptoManga: Decentralized Communication for Decentralized Gaming","description":"EPNS x CryptoManga: Decentralized Communication for Decentralized Gaming","date":"2022-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 15, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Nft","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/nft"}],"readingTime":1.6433333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-and-cryptomanga-team-up","title":"EPNS x CryptoManga: Decentralized Communication for Decentralized Gaming","description":"EPNS x CryptoManga: Decentralized Communication for Decentralized Gaming","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"The colossal rise of NFT-gaming in the past couple of years has led to a new dawn of the global gaming ecosystem.

We now have a multitude of decentralized gaming projects that allow gamers across the globe to monetize their game-time and create multiple sources of income. Among all these projects, CryptoManga is an emergent NFT-gaming platform that is steadily climbing the popularity charts for its unmatched story-telling combined with compelling gameplay.\\n\\nIn this essence, we at EPNS are pleased to announce our pilot collaboration with CryptoManga to facilitate superior user experiences through decentralized push notifications for gamers.\\n\\n### How CryptoManga Can Benefit From EPNS\\n\\nInspired by popular Japanese graphic novels, CryptoManga is an assortment of 5,555 unique NFTs, each representing the ownership of digital shells and identities. These identities and shells exist within the virtual Deathless City and create the opportunity for an enthralling play-to-earn gaming environment called the DarkBattle. In this virtual world, each NFT has a story of its own, represented as an NFN (non-fungible narrative) and generated using deep learning models.\\n\\nCryptoManga combines the manga illustration styles of the 90s with the present-day NFTs to create an unmatched gaming experience for gamers of the future. The best part is that this gaming environment is woven into Twitter and provides a unique way for Twitteratis to engage and interact with each other. CryptoManga\u2019s gaming mechanics combine DeFi with NFTs, allowing gamers to easily monetize their time and gameplay.\\n\\nNotably, the CryptoManga ecosystem is community-driven and is dependent on the users of the platform for crucial decision-making. Users can stake the native token $MAD to participate in platform governance on the MangaDAO.\\n\\nIn this context, CryptoManga needs a decentralized communication medium to connect with users and ensure that they do not miss out on governance updates. And, through our partnership with them, we aim to build this medium.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nAs a pilot collaboration, CryptoManga will soon have an official channel of its own on the EPNS platform. Users can subscribe to this channel to have a direct source of communication with the CryptoManga platform. This channel will send out decentralized push notifications to all subscribed users to keep them updated with platform governance activities. Users can expect to receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- New governance proposals are listed on the platform\\n- The status of the proposals change\\n- The results of the proposals are declared\\n\\nAs CryptoManga embarks on a journey to revolutionize the NFT-gaming space, we\u2019re pleased to collaborate with the platform and hope to continue this alliance into the future.\\n\\n# **About CryptoManga**\\n\\nCryptoManga is a collection of unique 5,555 NFTs representing the ownership of digital pseudonymous shells and identities that exist within a heterotopia of the Deathless City, a post-civilization world where the power structures have become nomadic and deterritorial.\\n\\n| [Website](https://cryptomanga.club/) | [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/cryptomanganft) |"},{"id":"poolz-finance-collaborates-with-epns","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/poolz-finance-collaborates-with-epns","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-14-poolz-finance-collaborates-with-epns/index.md","title":"Poolz Finance Collaborates with EPNS to Bring Push Notifications to Its Users","description":"Poolz Finance Collaborates with EPNS to Bring Push Notifications to Its Users","date":"2022-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Defi","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/defi"}],"readingTime":1.59,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"poolz-finance-collaborates-with-epns","title":"Poolz Finance Collaborates with EPNS to Bring Push Notifications to Its Users","description":"Poolz Finance Collaborates with EPNS to Bring Push Notifications to Its Users","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"From the get-go, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have served as a popular way to pool and swap liquidity within the DeFi ecosystem.

Projects in DeFi found a substantial way of generating the needed liquidity through yield farming and mining programs. However, when compared to centralized exchanges, DEXs appear to be quite limited in what they can do. Emergent DeFi startups and projects still find it difficult to pool initial startup funding and market entry liquidity on DEXs.\\n\\nTo solve this issue and help DeFi projects raise enough initial liquidity in a decentralized manner, Poolz Finance introduced a robust mechanism for new projects to raise funds through cross-chain liquidity auctions. In this regard, we at EPNS are pleased to announce our pilot collaboration with the protocol to enable direct communication with its users.\\n\\n### How Poolz Finance Can Benefit from EPNS\\n\\nPoolz Finance is a swapping protocol and IDO launchpad that aims to revolutionize fund-raising in DeFi. It essentially allows startups and new DeFi protocols to auction their tokens on the platform for bootstrapping liquidity. Poolz Finance features highly customizable pool options to cater to a wide range of DeFi projects with varying use cases, and supports multichain integrations. Moreover, the platform also helps nascent startups with pre-listings, bringing them close to early investors.\\n\\nFor investors, Poolz Finance provides a way to invest in the growth of early-stage projects. As such, it is essential for the protocol to constantly stay in touch with its users, keeping them updated about new IDO, pool launches, and whitelisting updates. Through our pilot collaboration with Poolz Finance, we aim to create a medium for direct communication between users and the protocol through push notifications.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nAs a result of this strategic collaboration, Poolz Finance will have an official channel on the EPNS platform. Users of Poolz Finance can subscribe to this channel to allow the protocol to directly communicate with them. They can expect to receive updates whenever a new liquidity pool is created on the platform and whenever a new token is available to claim. This alleviates the need for users to manually check the protocol for IDO launches, in turn saving them a lot of time and effort.\\n\\nAs Poolz Finance strives towards fostering innovative startups for DeFi, we\u2019re pleased to partner with them on this ambitious journey. In the near future, we may explore further synergies with Poolz Finance to help keep its users in the loop with everything that happens on the platform.\\n\\n# **About Poolz**\\n\\nPoolz is a decentralized fundraising and cross-chain launchpad. It is a hub for DeFi apps, enabling them to unravel the power of blockchain.\\n\\nWebsite: [http://poolz.finance](http://poolz.finance)\\n\\nApplication Form: [https://bit.ly/3gqxbKG](https://bit.ly/3gqxbKG)\\n\\nPoolz Ventures: [https://ventures.poolz.finance/  \\n](https://ventures.poolz.finance/)Telegram: [https://t.me/PoolzOfficialCommunity](https://t.me/PoolzOfficialCommunity)\\n\\nTelegram Announcements: [https://t.me/Poolz_Announcements](https://t.me/Poolz_Announcements)"},{"id":"dan-finlay-of-metamask\u2014volume-2","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/dan-finlay-of-metamask\u2014volume-2","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-10-dan-finlay-of-metamask\u2014volume-2/index.md","title":"Dan Finlay of Metamask \u2014 Volume 2 Ep 02 Recap","description":"Dan Finlay of Metamask \u2014 Volume 2 Ep 02 Recap","date":"2022-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 10, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Defi","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/defi"}],"readingTime":24.213333333333335,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"dan-finlay-of-metamask\u2014volume-2","title":"Dan Finlay of Metamask \u2014 Volume 2 Ep 02 Recap","description":"Dan Finlay of Metamask \u2014 Volume 2 Ep 02 Recap","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Hello Awesome PUSH community, an amazing interview conducted by our founders ;

Harsh and Richa and we would like to introduce to you the session where our guest was the one and only Dan Finlay\\n\\nIn this Session Recap, we will try to summarise the most interesting points for you.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 So, getting started\u2026..what connects your wallet to the dapp and what is that one single software that has onboarded millions of people into the web3 space\u2026\u2026..please welcome the OG of the space, the co-founder of metamask\u2026\u2026please welcome the one and only, the person who gives the coolest obligatory poses, Dan Finlay of Metamask.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 Hey Dan, how are you doing?\\n\\nDan \u2014 Hi, thanks for having me.\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 Thanks for being here dan, yeah so, let\u2019s get started with the interview.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 cool, awesome dan can you probably get started by telling us a little bit about yourself and the coolest folks of Web3\\n\\nDan \u2014 Umm so yeah, just a real quick background because I\u2019ve probably given the history a million times, so yeah i am a local of the bay area of california and i was more of a entertainer and actually i was making videos and stuff in my youth and then eventually you know from editing videos into programming apps and i eventually made friends with my co-founder Davis and he went to this meetup and learned about ethereum, we were co-working at that time and so we were talking a whole bunch about it and talking about how could you interact with an application where there\u2019s no single server, where there\u2019s no secrets anymore, users have to hold their own keys and you know we had some ideas then, and it sounded really easy at that time and so we were like \u201cokay, we\u2019ll make this real quick\u201d and he had an initial version that was entirely in the browser, it was like a browser in a browser which was extremely ambitious but eventually we dialed it back to just being a browser extension and now we also have a mobile client and here we are and it\u2019s almost 6 years later or i think from his original starting on the project it\u2019s like 7 years and 6 years since we first shared it with the public and it\u2019s changed a lot but not as much as i had liked and i\u2019m sure everybody has a million features they\u2019d like umm i think we really kind of unearthed a new product\u2019s category, The wallet. I think the closest thing we had was like a password manager maybe but a wallet isn\u2019t just typing in passwords, it\u2019s actually like potentially giving individual consent you know, it\u2019s got not just your account\u2019s but it\u2019s got the ability to perform actions on your behalf and the websites don\u2019t have that ability anymore and so this real inversion of control, so now whenever you perform an action on a website it has a opportunity to ask the user for permission and so we get to be this cool little service on a person\u2019s computer that gets their permission for stuff so i sometimes think about it as a little digital lawyer who sits on your computer and tells you \u201cthis website would like to do that, is that what you wanna do?\u201d and you know like we are trying to then we end up trying to really bridge that gap because we have have put you know something some consent between them and somebody else\u2019s idea of what to do with their money and yeah so that\u2019s like a little micro background on the product category and obviously this last year and and um we did a lot to facilitate layer two networks we added apis that let make it easier to switch networks from an application so users can now use multi-chain applications without entering config values and settings like just by con sensing to things you can use applications that are cross-chain and we are not stopping there um we really do have a vision of the wallet as a truly multi-chain thing where people have accounts of all types people have different security preferences you know not everyone\u2019s going to probably use their own um hotkeys for all of their assets you know obviously we have hardware wallets today um and there are also contract accounts today and now we\u2019ve got you know a distributed signing you know multi-party compute algorithms and um i think there\u2019s going to be a lot more and so we\u2019re trying to build the wallet in a way that can facilitate ongoing experimentation in in all of those ways so that people really have the ability to choose the risk profiles that make sense for them um and so anyways it\u2019s a obviously grown to be a much bigger project than we possibly imagined when we first heard of ethereum it sounded like it would be like rails like you write your logic now you make an app ta-da but the truth is there\u2019s just so much more to it than that and um it\u2019s been quite a ride and clearly there\u2019s uh quite a bit more to go.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 Yeah and that\u2019s an amazing like uh you know look back at the future at the past and also sneak peek in the future so i just want to do a little time travel with you mentioned that you know you were creating videos so before meta mask and web 3 what were you doing and what led you to take the plunge in web 3.\\n\\nDan \u2014 I did a lot of things i have a almost i could probably bore you by listing all the weird jobs that i had i\u2019ll tell you a couple weird ones i was a balloon twister for a little bit like so you\u2019d be at a restaurant and i would go up to you and say would you like a balloon animal and then but i was a balloon artist like people would say what can you make and i\u2019d say i\u2019m a balloon artist you tell me what you\u2019d like to me to make you know and so i got some good fun challenges there i had to make the starship enterprise one time or like the alien and predator and uh you know sometimes some good challenges but um i did a lot of improv comedy and um and then i was teaching computers at some art centers for a while um you know i really thought of myself as a communicator i had some background in my history that made me want to do something that was that had like social impact um but my best sense of how to do that was through communication so you know when things like the daily show came out for for a while i thought that was really going to be a big splash and then we go through all those years and it kind of felt like uh maybe just laughing at the problems isn\u2019t enough um you know we need to actually build alternative structures for facilitating better cooperation um between people and and yeah i think that occupy wall street was also i think it was impactful for a lot of us um for me there was like simultaneous really mixed feelings like partly like hey look there\u2019s a lot of this feeling out there a lot of people are discontent with the way things are there is a lot of will to help people out and yet it\u2019s so chaotic and disorganized you know like the people\u2019s mic like taking turns speaking regardless of you know no sense of priority or um you know or trust it just wasn\u2019t good enough and i think a lot of people came out of occupy with the sense that like it\u2019s like look we\u2019ve got reddit we can upvote comments we don\u2019t have to be sitting in a circle like taking turns talking we can definitely come up with a better way and so yeah i think um when i started learning how to write uh web apps was there was a recurring theme of like trying to make up better ways to debate better ways to make decisions together and i feel like a lot of the crypto space a lot of the web 3 space is kind of inspired from similar feelings like that it\u2019s like frustrations with how untrustworthy the old systems have been and a desire to build something better.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 That\u2019s so cool and yeah completely like agreeing with it. I just wanted to touch upon uh that now that we know matamas has a common evm household name but every software every project has a humble beginning can you describe like maybe what was metamask uh like back then.\\n\\nDan \u2014 So when kumamba first learned about uh ethereum he was trying out a few different experiments he probably went through like three little experiments for what a wallet could be like his first one was like a terminal in the browser and i was like not user friendly enough at all and then the next one was the browser in browsers and that was uh it ended up being really hard to do um and yeah and so then we came up with the browser extension and yeah early on oh it was very janky we should we should definitely post screenshots from the early versions because the truth is we\u2019ve gone through like four major reskins of metamask but sometimes people say like oh metamask hasn\u2019t changed very much i really think that we\u2019re like in a boil the frog situation people don\u2019t notice all the changes that are happening but the first version um all your accounts had a walrus avatar um they uh oh the um the confirmations were uh little notifications from the browser so you couldn\u2019t interact with them at all you could just accept or deny and so gas price was always just fixed there was uh you couldn\u2019t import accounts or anything like that um we didn\u2019t have any notion of tokens for the first like couple years or something like you know your c20 was an idea somebody was like this is a thing we should do and then and for a while i kind of had the opinion like look we\u2019ve got a big enough job just showing confirmations like we could probably do confirmations like we could probably do that and then somebody could come along and make a dashboard app and show tokens right but eventually tokens just became so fundamental to what people expected were like okay let\u2019s add them yeah and that\u2019s probably me dragging my feet like i really do value like focus i think that there\u2019s enough of us working on this stuff that we could carve out smaller pieces .\\n\\nRicha \u2014 Yeah! sounds pretty cool and that\u2019s a great sneak at the past in metamask i\u2019d love to put those screens and also would love to see the walrus avatars.\\n\\nDan \u2014 Oh yeah! So yeah\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 I would love to see those balloon things if you still have them.\\n\\nDan \u2014 Oh yeah, the blue yeah, yeah if i\u2019ve got some pictures of them i\u2019ll try uh tweeting one out if i can dig one up i mean i still have my balloon kit so i could probably just make like an ethereum logo or something you know or epns, we will see, will see.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 That\u2019s amazing, thanks for just coming back to the origin of metamask. How did the low poly design fox come into being, what is the origin of the name and the design?\\n\\nDan \u2014 uh! that was actually kind of a combination of different people so kumamba said had the idea of he\u2019s like he wanted it to be an animal that was low poly that maybe evoked the letter m that\u2019s that\u2019s the prompt as i remember it and then he he shared it with a colleague of ours uh christian geria who then made a svg fox that was kind of looking to the side and it\u2019s uh you know it was our original version one of the fox and then this was before i had actually joined so then i saw that and i was like oh it looks like it could be 3d so i was uh i was going to surprise him as part of my kind of joining the team and so i went on craigslist and i looked for 3d designers and i found somebody and i actually worked with them and it took like four drafts there\u2019s actually they\u2019re online somewhere where there\u2019s like there\u2019s like several versions of it as it kind of changes to what it became and uh i made it into a script where it would follow the cursor you know yeah so it was kind of i think we\u2019ve been passing it around in the spirit of like improv you know a lot of yes and a lot of taking something changing it and uh making it a little better.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 Also then uh would love to know you spoke about uh some alpha so would love to know what\u2019s the coolest alpha drop that is coming up feature-wise in metamask now.\\n\\nDan \u2014 Uh yeah so something that\u2019s cool that uh that probably just happened a couple days ago on january 18th if everything goes according to schedule um we will have launched uh something that we\u2019re calling metamask flask it\u2019s um a special developer distribution of metamask where we\u2019re going to experiment with features that are a little experimental a little more a little more bold than we would usually push to all users and so developers are welcome to install flask as their as their metamask driver as long as they know how to backup their keys and are willing to do a little uh coding to um you know if they if they write an application that relies on it uh just assume that apis will break so you might have to yeah we\u2019re we\u2019re saying flask is for developers um we\u2019re going to break apis but we\u2019re going to do some fun crazy things and the first fun crazy thing we\u2019re going to do on flask is we\u2019ve got a version of snaps we started realizing that something this big inorder to get it to production needed to not be a long-running branch but needed to be built in a way where we can turn it on with a single flip of a switch and so that\u2019s what flask is every feature on flask we can trivially transition into production and so uh in in flask we\u2019ve got a basic version of snaps the first version is very simple it allows you to provide apis to sites uh display confirmations to users or alerts if you\u2019re maybe something like epns as well as perform some cryptographic information with keys that are derived from the user\u2019s secret recovery phrase so long term we\u2019re going to be adding a lot of really cool apis to snaps letting you represent snaps-based assets in the user\u2019s wallet ,adding new account types showing warnings or endorsements on contracts and and much more we have a lot of things that we think this is going to be useful for so we we really think that this is going to unlock um multiple layers of innovation that just were not open to before like in the past you had to build a whole new wallet from scratch if you wanted to do a lot of these things and so uh it\u2019s been a lot of work it\u2019s basically been the equivalent of building a new operating system kernel um so i hope that people can understand and be patient with us um but i think the reward is going to be great i think we\u2019re going to make the wallet a much more versatile um tool\\n\\nRicha \u2014 Tool that\u2019s amazing and when can we expect the alpha drop to be you know ready to test and play around with.\\n\\nDan \u2014 By the time this errors you can go to flask.metamask.io and you can download it and try it out\\n\\nRicha \u2014 Awesome amazing and like super so much respect for everything that you\u2019ve been doing uh speaking of respect metamask has actually crossed 21 million active users and which is like a wow number for everybody so i just wanted to ask what has been the biggest challenge that you faced during this journey of you know this big huge metrics.\\n\\nDan \u2014 Uh the biggest challenge along the way uh i think i think it all becomes psychological at a certain point like like there\u2019s a point like everybody knows this ecosystem does not sleep you know it is 24/7 and um in particular you know if you\u2019re building if you\u2019re building a defi app or a wallet your users have like financial uh you know things at stake and when there is a an outrage or there\u2019s a bug or if there\u2019s you know god forbid if there\u2019s ever a vulnerability of any kind you don\u2019t sleep you get up you do it um and so i think that there were some periods in the middle that we we hadn\u2019t prepared for how serious this space can be at times um you know like i think you know just when we started it was like a hack yeah so the first year or two um like when the 2017 ico boom was happening that was a very hard period i think that we also had some hard periods where um you know it was like the bear season of like 2019 where people were starting to have some doubt we definitely weren\u2019t getting funded the way we are now that we\u2019ve you know created revenue um and so we were stretched then and we weren\u2019t sure if this is because a wallet is a big project or if we were just kind of failing at it you know and i think that we\u2019ve learned now that yes actually a wallet is a very big project and um we\u2019re finally i think treating it with the seriousness that it deserves and we\u2019re we\u2019re uh yeah trying to make sure everything gets the the love that it that it needs you know there\u2019s like so much creativity and innovation happening that uh yeah i mean maybe the hardest part is just like keeping up with it all it\u2019s just like you know i mean not that not that any of us do but you\u2019re trying to you can you can use yourself of just doing that.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 absolutely hundred percent and like speaking of what uh you know there is always one feature in the project that is very close to your heart or even like for my heart in my project but people really don\u2019t embrace it as much as you would want to so is there a feature like that uh with metamask.\\n\\nDan \u2014 yeah kind of i think i think there\u2019s a couple features that we have where i think people don\u2019t appreciate how they kind of complete a story um we\u2019ve got we\u2019ve got like these three features actually that i think make multi-chain long tail creativity viable on metamask so what we added is a library that\u2019s an onboarding library so people can say oh get your wallet and we get the person set up and then link back to the site then we added an api that adds your custom network so if you\u2019re on a layer 2 it says, hey this site uses blah blah you know chain would you you know would you like to switch to it or add it and then and then they do now they\u2019re on that chain and then the third method is our eip 747 which is um add a custom asset too so then you can say we also use this token would you like to show that in your wallet and and so there what we\u2019ve done is there with no central uh server nothing that can go down you know other than the site\u2019s own uh networks and dependencies we\u2019ve enabled a user to um arrive at a site without a wallet get it use a custom network and use an asset that nobody\u2019s maybe listing um all just with clicks of consent and and to me that that\u2019s really important we didn\u2019t even introduce a central major list or anything we just let you go to a site and purely through the trust that you\u2019ve got established with that link and and yes i\u2019m saying there\u2019s an act of trust when you visit a link don\u2019t click links from people you don\u2019t trust don\u2019t trust links from strangers but upon visiting a link that you can trust we can we can fully onboard you to a tool a new ecosystem a new chain that is possibly as cheap as you can imagine and a new asset that somebody may have just made up minutes before and and to me i\u2019m very proud of that.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 Awesome awesome and i would love to know that you know what\u2019s one of the maybe the coolest um experiments that you have seen in web 3 that hasn\u2019t sort of wagged me yet but you think has a lot of potential.\\n\\nDan \u2014 i\u2019ll i\u2019ll give a shout out i just yesterday learned that i guess a project by rick dudley laconic after four years in stealth mode is about to come out it was inspired by a lot of the problems that infuria or like hosting ethereum nodes has where like everyone trusts this central node but now that central node has all the server costs in this one everybody helps save some state and they help gossip it to each other um i i like \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ safe uh add-ons like the they have a whole module system um you know what\u2019s the zodiac uh kind of ecosystem i think is really cool because they\u2019re making \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ safe as a contract account allows anyone to write a contract that plugs in and can act on behalf of that contract and so zodiac is a suite of these modules that are oriented at DAOs and so it\u2019s kind of becoming a plug-and-play DAO system and um and it\u2019s a very lightweight one so i you know love and respect uh like the \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ approach and stuff and uh you know and and colony and you know there\u2019s like all these great experiments in dapps um but i really i like this one because it\u2019s just doing such a good um like featherweight you know your know is safe it\u2019s one contract module just add the modules you need you know it\u2019s like and you know the nose to safe wasn\u2019t even made for that you know i like seeing when people make contracts where they\u2019re interoperable and they didn\u2019t even have to be made together but they\u2019re just they\u2019re made so uh so well that somebody else can repurpose them i love seeing that kind of things.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 Amazing!\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 Yeah, awesome so and dan , i wanted to know like metamask, how do you guys decide like what feature should come on metamask or not like uh is there a thought process behind it we would love to know that.\\n\\nDan \u2014 yeah yeah yeah ideally it would all just be like public and open and available for others to like mutate and i know i have a doc running where i\u2019m like where i put my like craziest like open decision making process ideas today it\u2019s not that um it\u2019s not that yeah let\u2019s say like hash linked into centralized uh we\u2019ve got a series of different documents these days a lot of the prioritization is actually happening in a notion although i do a lot of like um brainstorms on on \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ so github obviously has lots of issues and lots of feature requests and there\u2019s so many i think we have like you know like 10 000 or something um and so what we try to do is we try to lump them into categories we try to list those categories and then we start talking about okay strategically which of these categories are like facilitating our upcoming goals and so just and then combine that with our long-term goals so we\u2019ve got like long-term like i have a sense of what i think a wallet needs to become you know like in 20 years if we haven\u2019t done that we kind of failed um but of course along the way we have to adapt to the current ecosystem we say oh it looks like you know the transaction fees are too damn high we really need to make sure that layer two is thriving right now so yeah so we combine our high level plans these kind of thematic we call like uh epics or initiatives uh use that to kind of prioritize the groups of issues that we\u2019re doing on a quarter by quarter basis uh we do have a community page where we invite people to post feature requests so that\u2019s ends up being one of those things where it\u2019s like okay well that\u2019s a feature that i\u2019d like to develop alongside all of our other features and so now we have to decide whether you know how much energy we want to put on optimizing our process this or that which you know which is coming first um i think uh we have so many things that we want to do that uh even just laying them out can be uh an enormous task.\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 That\u2019s an amazing insight and thanks for uh diving so deep into it uh on that note like uh we spoke about like how you guys uh look into what upcoming features will come on metamask but metamask itself has so many cool features that not many people know about uh i want you to outline one cool picture of metamask which people haven\u2019t embraced yet.\\n\\nDan \u2014 i don\u2019t think people have noticed that like sometimes we ship features and people don\u2019t even notice here\u2019s two um people haven\u2019t noticed that you can log in with multiple accounts and facilitate multi-account apps um so for example a portfolio dap like zapper or zaryan could ask for you to select as many accounts as you want they can they can view those and you can uh now interact with all those accounts at once um that\u2019s a cool thing that basically nobody\u2019s doing today also we added an encryption api so you can send encrypted messages to metamask users it does require them um providing a publickey first and then anyone can write encrypted messages to those keys and then we have a special method for decrypting those if you wanted to make a end-to-end encrypted uh messaging app or anything that incorporates absolutely secret messages to the user that\u2019s an api that\u2019s available today very few dapps have you know they use it in a creative way they don\u2019t use it even in the way that it was designed naturally they\u2019re hacking it um but uh yeah and not a lot of people using it to actually make uh encrypted messaging.\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 Got it, that\u2019s a signed message right ?\\n\\nDan \u2014 no that\u2019s um it\u2019s decrypt uh wallet decrypt method method i think\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 Wallet Decrypt ?\\n\\nDan \u2014 Yeah, docs.metamask.io there\u2019s some there\u2019s some secret gems in there we\u2019re going to be giving a lot of love to our docs uh in this coming year.\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 Awesome uh all right moving forward uh then like there\u2019s so many uh so-called chapter of wallet wars what\u2019s your opinion on that?\\n\\nDan \u2014 Yeah so what do i think about wallet wars well there\u2019s definitely more wallets today than there have ever been uh in our history and we knew when we built metamask we were building it on open standards you know the secret recovery phrase is an open standard and we did that so that people would have the option of using other tools that would work for them and yeah i think that there are a lot of there are so many things that a wallet could do and that a person might want a wallet to do that i think that there\u2019s a lot of value in having many approach you know like naturally having contract accounts is like a must-have for some people and then having having a an account that is like maybe it\u2019s more defy centric maybe it\u2019s more nft centric you know everyone\u2019s got their own sense of what web 3 is and i feel like every wallet developer is kind of bringing their own sense of that you know web3 is a it\u2019s like a very very big concept and i think that uh metamask maybe it\u2019s just because we were first uh or you know technically i guess like mist was first but you know they\u2019re they\u2019re not around anymore but because we were early and we\u2019re kind of the oldest web 3 wallet i feel like we kind of have a responsibility to kind of play the middle where we try to enable as many different use cases as possible um we\u2019re not over pandering to one community we\u2019re not you know just trying to integrate the features that facilitate one use case you know but i think also when you start making a wallet that\u2019s more entrenched in one use case um it can kind of compromise on the interoperability like when you go to another site now if that site wants to interact with the assets on that other thing that\u2019s that\u2019s part of the fun of web3 part of the fun is i can take my tokens from this sale i can take in this exchange i can bond them in this DAO i can back them on this nft you know you can go to different sites and you\u2019re doing lots of different things with the same underlying assets and i think that kind of interoperability largely comes from having a wallet that is trying to facilitate the widest set of use cases and it\u2019s totally the hardest thing to do anyways i think there\u2019s a lot of uh creative approaches to wallets right now i think you know i see a lot of people taking a lot of approaches i still don\u2019t see anybody that i think has like nailed why i\u2019m in it and why metamask is doing it um and so you know i wish them the best of luck in meeting their needs um as wallets but i look forward to somebody doing what i have in mind better than me because then i can finally get some rest.\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 that\u2019s nicely put and uh i don\u2019t think that\u2019s not happening in the near future so yeah.\\n\\nDan \u2014 yeah lots of very different ideas that\u2019s for sure.\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 Yep Yep, awesome so dan um i would love to know what\u2019s next for you what are the plans of 2022 and how do you see that evolving ?\\n\\nDan \u2014 uh 2022 well well we all know that it\u2019s the uh year of layer two thread um and uh yeah but i think for us we\u2019ve got we\u2019ve got some big uh design changes and improvements in mind largely oriented at facilitating scalability we\u2019re finally bringing ntfs to extension and we\u2019ve got some nice extra features for nft lovers in the in the works we\u2019re going to continue making transactions more readable um if we do it right we will try to get snaps to production and so metamask will be a fully not just multi-evm chain but maybe facilitating finally contract accounts and all sorts of other cool innovation i can\u2019t wait for that looking forward to finally have syncing across devices possibly-possibly maybe finally get some proper social features although i think that proper decentralized social is a little bit harder than most people think i think it\u2019s easy to just build a new web 2 social network on top of a wallet but i think that there are some things that if we want to make it a healthy ecosystem we should try to do right yea i think i think it\u2019s going to be a big year for for improving scalability and and readability and and i think the usability i think it\u2019s going to step up just like how it feels to use it like i think we are still we\u2019re using a lot of the ux that we\u2019ve had for like two and a half three years um i think that we\u2019re going to be stepping it up a lot i think we\u2019re going to be improving a lot of apis um i think it\u2019ll be a good year for developing and using web3.\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 awesome awesome so yeah one last question because we spoke about social network and uh innovation so what do you feel about communication or the pre-native communication via wallets. of course we are talking about us and i would love to know your opinion about it.\\n\\nDan \u2014 Yeah so i mean i think the first principle that i would just advocate and i think that you already do this is is that communication should be opt-in like the last thing we want is anybody can ping my address right um but as long as i\u2019m subscribing to things then i think that it\u2019s on the right direction um obviously we\u2019ve got all sorts of interesting architectural problems like who owes the server do the notifications go down if one server goes down if so that\u2019s a little embarrassing from a web 3 perspective and yet not unrealistic because of the realities of how things get built especially bit by bit communication within the like should we have a messenger built into the wallet at some point you know status does that and that\u2019s that\u2019s really cool you know maybe on the mobile client someday we\u2019ll have something like that um for now you could pretty much do that as a website on the desktop app so that\u2019s not unthinkable but should it be embedded i don\u2019t know i don\u2019t think it\u2019s our top priority right now although uh we do have we\u2019ve had some experiments that i think are get fun where we could we could make a chat where we incorporate like the apis into the chat this is like going off this is not meta masks team uh sanctioned but uh that had a like a weekend hack with kumavs a little while back where we made like a chatbot that incorporated a javascript api within the chat context and i could imagine making a cool like social smart contracting environment where you can like actually maybe code and invoke and interact right there in the chat um i think that\u2019d be really fun someday.\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 Yeah, that\u2019s insane.\\n\\nDan \u2014 no no no that was that\u2019s a lot that\u2019s uh so so there\u2019s there\u2019s a lot of different things that communication can mean of course right like so PUSH, it\u2019s a good starting point because like any other communication is based on it and uh and it seems like it should be a simple use case although making it properly decentralized is always more uh complicated than you might anticipate yep, yes so congratulations on the launch today.\\n\\nHarsh \u2014 Thanks thanks, you so ,much sam uh awesome so this brings us to the end of phase one of the interview done uh what we don\u2019t tell our guest is that richa basically uh online uh i mean she stalks uh i guess online prepares a customized set of key questions for them and then uh ask uh those questions to you uh so that\u2019s uh the phase two of the interview and on to you richa.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 thanks and these are not as scary questions as harsh as making them sound they\u2019re just funny questions so then i\u2019ll just ask some questions maybe rapid fire take five to ten seconds and we\u2019ll have some fun all right so let\u2019s get started .\\n\\nyour favorite builder?\\n\\nDan \u2014 i mean i feel like the word builder for me is almost synonymous with austin griffith like he\u2019s with the build i feel like he\u2019s done so much for making usable tools and building a community like taking on apprentices i think it\u2019s just a wonderful thing.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 yep yep and he\u2019s one of our favorite guests as well . so the next question, if fox doesn\u2019t exist in the world what does the metamask logo look like?\\n\\nDan \u2014 um maybe it\u2019s an octopus uh just because her next choice was the mustache but i don\u2019t know um yeah yeah i\u2019ll go with the octopus for now.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 so you get up and it\u2019s the year 2050, what do you see?\\n\\nDan \u2014 i get up well do we even see any more or do we just like interpret our kind of neural link sensory inputs from the world um uh hopefully i see a bunch of um well hopefully i see my bedroom and then i step out and hopefully i see a community of friends who are you know have what they need to and are empowered to uh you know build lives that they\u2019re happy with.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 we know you\u2019re multi-talented so what\u2019s your another hidden talent that we don\u2019t know of\\n\\nDan \u2014 i did i played a lot of violin as a child with like eight years or something so um when i make digital instruments they\u2019re usually fretless like i like between the notes i think it\u2019s a beautiful thing to not be constrained to a single scale.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 one of the most popular questions asked, when dollar meta ?\\n\\nDan \u2014 when dollar meta ? you mean like when token yeah uh uh definitely not as soon as you\u2019re hoping just just dial back dial back a little bit take take a break build something you care about uh don\u2019t count on us to you know like we\u2019re we\u2019re really focused on enabling people to enable themselves um you know if if we you know at any point do something like that you know we\u2019ll we\u2019ll make sure our community is the first to know but not not too soon\\n\\nRicha \u2014 awesome and that\u2019s a shout out to everybody who\u2019s trying to claim some airdrops so there is no token out there.\\n\\nDan \u2014 yeah yes we\u2019ll tell you what tell you what if you\u2019re ever claiming an airdrop just know a real airdrop is not going to ask for your secret recovery phrase okay just step one you know you can go get some shady tokens from strangers on twitter just like if they throw errors on etherscan and try to direct you to some other shady website you know don\u2019t give them your secret recovery phrase etc.. etc basically don\u2019t give out your secret recovery face and then you should be okay like you know it\u2019s fine to accept airdrops and see what those are worth but yeah just um don\u2019t also give away everything you own\\n\\nRicha \u2014 there you heard it if you could be a fly on the wall who would you want to listen in on ?\\n\\nDan \u2014 on these days i honestly i feel like i\u2019m so lucky i feel like i get to listen in on i think i feel like i get to join and and talk to and uh interact with you know some of the the most incredibly brilliant people in the world and and i\u2019m so grateful um honestly at metamask i\u2019ve we\u2019ve been getting enormous uh inspiration and mentorship from the folks at agoric so people like mark miller and dean tribble and uh and chris kowal um you know and kate sills and oh i mean i won\u2019t gonna like list that whole company sorry i will i\u2019m gonna hold back but um uh incredibly grateful i i love talking to mark and them and um they they teach us so much about building secure distributed systems and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really doing and they\u2019ve got like decades of thoughts on the topic and so i\u2019ve been so so happy to meet people that feel like they\u2019re historically deep on a topic that i\u2019ve found myself in.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 amazing uh what is the first thing that comes to your mind when i say the following wrong answers only. ATH ?\\n\\nDan \u2014 a hundred dollars right\\n\\nRicha \u2014 \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nDan \u2014 yeah we i i sure hope so let\u2019s let\u2019s make it so make it so let\u2019s not assume it.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 huh yes gm uh\\n\\nDan \u2014 yeah good morning\\n\\nRicha \u2014 Wrong answers only\\n\\nDan \u2014 Oh wrong answers only, oh sorry uh gold mine.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 amazing your favorite ice cream flavor.\\n\\nDan \u2014 i don\u2019t eat a lot of ice cream oh i\u2019ve been enjoying a salted caramel mochi though.\\n\\nRicha \u2014 really good cats or dogs?\\n\\nDan \u2014 cats, all right i got a cat i love him\\n\\nRicha \u2014 there you go your favorite superhero?\\n\\nDan \u2014 I\u2019m not a huge comic book person so you know my earliest formative superhero was just Superman.

Among these digital assets, cryptocurrencies have remained investors\u2019 popular choice in the last decade. However, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have recently picked up pace last year, providing investors with yet another viable investment opportunity and not to forget a ticket to the metaverse. Owing to this fact, NFTs recorded a whopping $41 billion in sales last year and experts believe that this number is set to grow exponentially.\\n\\nIn this regard, the emergent NFT marketplace Digible is creating an exciting and easily accessible platform for investors and collectors to enter the NFT revolution. Today, we at EPNS are enthralled to announce our pilot program collaboration with Digible through which we aim to redefine the way the platform communicates with its users.\\n\\n### How Digible Can Benefit From the Partnership With EPNS\\n\\nDescribed as the \u201ccollector\u2019s metaverse\u201d, Digible is an NFT marketplace that aims to combine the best of the physical and digital worlds through NFTs. It allows users to buy, sell, trade, and exchange rare physical cards that hold a reliable value. Every NFT on the platform is supported by an underlying physical asset that users can uniquely own.\\n\\nMoreover, Digible also offers a set of unique services like DigiDuel, DigiSafe, and DigiGrade to its users. DigiDuel allows users to battle for rare NFTs on the platform and DigiSafe and DigiGrade help in securing and safely storing valuable NFTs.\\n\\nOn this note, the platform needs a reliable medium for exchanging information with its users and updating them about the status of their NFTs. EPNS aims to create this channel for Digible.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our collaboration with Digible, we aim to create a means for the platform to be able to communicate with its users to pass on updates and increase user participation. Users of Digible can subscribe to its official channel on EPNS to receive decentralized push notifications whenever\\n\\n- They receive an offer on their NFTs\\n- Their offer for NFTs has been canceled or accepted\\n- They\u2019ve won or lost an auction bid for NFTs\\n- Sellers receive a new bid on the NFTs\\n- A sealed NFT box has been opened\\n- A new sale is made on the platform\\n\\nDigible\u2019s unique approach to combining the physical and virtual worlds through NFTs is poised to create a unique appeal in the world of NFTs and we\u2019re pleased to collaborate with this platform on their ambitious journey.\\n\\n# **About Digible**\\n\\nDigible\u2122 is powering the collector\u2019s metaverse for physically-backed collectibles by using blockchain technology to eliminate the friction of trading physical collectibles. Allowing for collectible investors such as hobby fanatics and private equity firms to acquire physical collectibles without having to worry about where to store them.\\n\\nHow it works:\\n\\nUsers that send items to the DigiSafe\u2122 will receive an NFT that contains a scanned image of their physical item, and acts as a freely tradeable legal title to the physical item. If the user wishes to retrieve their physical item, they can claim it on the Digible platform. Digible will then burn the NFT and send them the physical item at their shipping expense.\\n\\nCore products:\\n\\nDigible\u2122 marketplace: Cross-chain, Decentralized marketplace for trading physically-backed collectibles as NFTs.\\n\\nDigiGrade\u2122: Grading and authentication service for collectibles on the chain.\\n\\nDigiSafe\u2122: Decentralized, safe, insured storage of physical items represented by NFTs. Professional collectors and businesses with adequate insurance may apply for Digisafe status to qualify for additional revenue for storing of collectibles.\\n\\nDigiGames\u2122: Battle NFTs with each other in the form of mini-games and allows for third-party game developers to build card dueling systems and play to earn games using pure and physically-backed NFTs.\\n\\nDigiWax\u2122: Open-source protocol for sealed virtual NFT packs/boxes filled with physically-backed collectibles and digital collectibles. Secured and verified by Chainlink VRF. Breaker\u2019s can digitally seal boxes and ensure a verifiably fair distribution of NFTs to the participants.\\n\\nDigible\u2122 believes that physically-backed collectibles will consume a large portion of the NFT market by 2023. This vision has led to us building the future of collectibles, all on the blockchain. We believe that the transparency on blockchain will lead to a safer, more accessible, and fair ecosystem for the world to access the physical collectibles and trading card markets.\\n\\n| [Website](https://digible.io/) | [Medium](https://digibleio.medium.com/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/digibleio) |"},{"id":"epns-allies-with-mstable","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-allies-with-mstable","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-02-epns-allies-with-mstable/index.md","title":"EPNS Allies With mStable to Facilitate Decentralized Notifications for Users","description":"EPNS Allies With mStable to Facilitate Decentralized Notifications for Users","date":"2022-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 2, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Stable Coin","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/stable-coin"}],"readingTime":1.87,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-allies-with-mstable","title":"EPNS Allies With mStable to Facilitate Decentralized Notifications for Users","description":"EPNS Allies With mStable to Facilitate Decentralized Notifications for Users","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Stablecoins in DeFi have proven to be an excellent store of value and a medium of exchange within the decentralized framework.

However, recent years witnessed the extreme fragmentation of the stablecoin ecosystem. DeFi protocols and investment opportunities initially started out to be DAI-centric but they now incorporate a plethora of other stablecoins. This leaves investors and traders in DeFi constantly juggling between all the available stablecoins to take advantage of these DeFi opportunities on different platforms.\\n\\nTo circumvent this problem, the DeFi protocol mStable has come up with the concept of meta-assets that can be created by combining all these individual stablecoins into a single stable asset. The creation of these meta-assets can prove to be extremely crucial for the stablecoin economy and inturn DeFi as a whole, and we at EPNS are pleased to collaborate with mStable to improve their user experience.\\n\\n### How mStable Benefits from Decentralized Push Notifications\\n\\nmStable is a DeFi protocol and a meta-asset platform that unites stablecoin lending and swapping to create a decentralized stablecoin ecosystem. It addresses some of the major problems with stablecoins by essentially knitting the fragmented pegged-asset economy into a single standard.\\n\\nAnyone can mint meta-assets permissionlessly like mUSD on this platform by depositing a 1:1 ratio of other USD-backed assets like USDC, DAI, or USDT. This essentially means that mUSD is more stable, secure, and reliable when compared to DAI because it is fully backed by several stablecoins at once with capped weight limits for each individual stablecoin. So, in a practical sense, mStable allows for the creation of new asset-backed tokens that are greater than the sum of their counterparts, while enhancing the utility of stablecoins through its market-leading savings product.\\n\\nThe entire mStable ecosystem is powered by the native governance token MTA. Users can stake this token to participate in platform governance and earn a share of the monthly staking rewards and platform fees. In this regard, EPNS through this strategic partnership aims to build a communication channel for users and the protocol to help them better collaborate for governance and decision-making.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nDecentralized push notifications are set to become an integral part of the mStable ecosystem once the collaboration gets going. mStable\u2019s official channel on EPNS will be live for users to subscribe to and this will keep them updated about the various steps in the governance process. Users will receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- A new proposal is submitted for voting\\n- Changes are made to existing proposals\\n- Voting process begins\\n- Voting process ends\\n- The results of the voting are declared\\n- The staking vault has been topped up with rewards.\\n\\nAs mStable strives to bring about a significant change in the stablecoin ecosystem, we\u2019re pleased to work with them on this journey and hope to become an integral part of their ecosystem.\\n\\n# **About mStable**\\n\\nmStable is an autonomous and non-custodial infrastructure for pegged-value crypto assets. The protocol was created to address problems in the pegged-asset economy like lack of yield, lack of protection, and significant fragmentation. mStable provides a solution to these three problems through the creation of meta-assets, which are fully backed by a diversified basket of existing tokenized same-base assets.\\n\\n| [Website](https://mstable.org/) | [Medium](https://medium.com/mstable) |"},{"id":"epns-collaborates-with-gro-protocol","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-collaborates-with-gro-protocol","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-31-epns-collaborates-with-gro-protocol/index.md","title":"EPNS Collaborates With Gro Protocol to Enable Decentralized Notifications for Users","description":"EPNS Collaborates With Gro Protocol to Enable Decentralized Notifications for Users","date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 31, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Gro Protocol","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/gro-protocol"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"}],"readingTime":1.91,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-collaborates-with-gro-protocol","title":"EPNS Collaborates With Gro Protocol to Enable Decentralized Notifications for Users","description":"EPNS Collaborates With Gro Protocol to Enable Decentralized Notifications for Users","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"With interest rates and stock markets plummeting in the wake of the pandemic, the DeFi industry came as an attractive new opportunity for investors who benefited from its global accessibility and higher returns.

Yet, the majority of financial products in DeFi still cater to investors with a higher risk appetite. Risk-averse investors still find it very difficult to enter the decentralized framework and as such are left out of the revolution.\\n\\nFor DeFi to be able to compete with TradFi and potentially replace it needs to cater to varying risk appetites of investors and make it easy for users to transition into the decentralized world. DeFi\u2019s emergent [Gro Protocol](https://app.gro.xyz/) was launched in an effort to achieve this and we at EPNS are pleased to partner with them on this ambitious journey.\\n\\n### How Gro Protocol Can Benefit From Decentralized Notifications\\n\\nGro Protocol is a DeFi yield optimizer and stablecoin yield aggregator that is built to balance risk and protect savings through its tranching mechanism. The protocol offers PWRD and Vault that cater to varying risk appetites and combine the best of TradFi and DeFi to provide ideal returns to investors.\\n\\nPWRD is a protected savings product that consists of stablecoin baskets and the risk here is diversified across protocols and stablecoins used to ensure that investors get the best possible returns while being protected against exotic risks like protocol exploitation. Vault, on the other hand, is a product with a slightly higher risk factor that protects PWRD in return for sharing yield from PWRD deposits. Both these products are designed to offer everyday investors a taste of DeFi higher returns and transparency while efficiently optimizing to balance risk and yields.\\n\\nThe protocol\u2019s native GRO token acts as a medium of exchange within the network and it can be earned through airdrops, liquidity mining, and vesting bonuses. In this regard, there is a need for a reliable channel of communication between users and the protocol to keep users updated about the status of their GRO tokens and EPNS helps build this channel.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our pilot collaboration with Gro Protocol, we aim to create a means of seamless communication between users and the protocol through decentralized push notifications. Gro Protocol will have an official channel on EPNS that is set to go live in February this year. Users can subscribe to this channel to receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- New airdrops are available for users to claim.\\n- Airdrops are about to expire.\\n- They are eligible to claim GRO tokens from Vesting Bonus Pool.\\n\\nAs Gro Protocol works towards making DeFi accessible to everyday users, we\u2019re pleased to collaborate with them on this journey and hope to be an integral part of their operations.\\n\\n# **About Gro Protocol**\\n\\n[Gro](https://www.gro.xyz) is a DeFi protocol offering leveraged and protected stablecoin yields through risk tranching. Its products include PWRD, Vault and Labs. Gro protocol uses an automated portfolio of stablecoin yield strategies to balance yield against risk. PWRD users are protected from loss by Vault users, who take a leveraged share of protocol returns from PWRD. As Gro focuses almost entirely on stablecoins, market price volatility is minimized, even in higher risk products.\\n\\nTo learn more about Gro: [dApp](http://app.gro.xyz) | [Docs](https://docs.gro.xyz) | [Medium](https://groprotocol.medium.com/) | [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/groprotocol) | [Discord](http://discord.gg/gro) | [Telegram](https://t.me/gro_announcements) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSQeNePRCe-rfCs1eLjOhTw)"},{"id":"epns-monthly-blocks-jan-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-monthly-blocks-jan-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-31-epns-monthly-blocks-jan-2022/index.md","title":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","description":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","date":"2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 31, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"}],"readingTime":3.513333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-monthly-blocks-jan-2022","title":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","description":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"There have been very special moments though our journey that leave a mark in our hearts, and this month the EPNS Mainnet launch is one of them.

Offering transparency, decentralization, a new layer of privacy, and global accessibility to users, the industry soared to heights never seen before. However, these very distinguishing features of DeFi made the industry an easy target for hackers and defaulters who encashed it heavily. The industry lost more than $2.8B (according to Chainanalysis) to hackers and accounted for a good portion of all hacks globally.\\n\\nThis problem needed to be fixed and quickly, before users started to lose trust in the technology. As a savior for DeFi came Bridge Mutual, the DeFi protocol offering unmatched safety and security for users. We at EPNS are pleased to announce our Collaboration with Bridge Mutual through which we aim to create a reliable communication channel for the protocol and its users.\\n\\n### How Bridge Mutual Can Benefit from EPNS\\n\\nBridge Mutual is a decentralized coverage platform for DeFi that enables users to safeguard their assets and investments. Users of the platform can buy covers akin to insurance for their crypto assets to compensate for any hacks, thefts, or exploits. This allows them to safely navigate the DeFi space with the assurance that their investments are safe.\\n\\nApart from buying coverage, users of this platform can also provide coverage by staking stablecoins in dedicated pools. This allows them to earn a yield on their stake in a high-risk/high-reward scenario. Stakers earn their rewards in the form of stablecoins or BMI tokens.\\n\\nHowever, the lack of a proper communication medium between users and the protocol creates friction, and users have to manually check if their premiums have expired or when new claims are made. This could cause users to miss out on deadlines and risk losing coverage. Through our partnership with Bridge Mutual, we aim to address this very issue.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nEPNS and Bridge Mutual will be working in collaboration to build a reliable communication medium for users of the platform. Bridge Mutual will have a dedicated channel on EPNS that users of the platform could subscribe to. Users can opt to receive whenever\\n\\n- A new insurance claim is made on the platform.\\n- Their coverage premium expires.\\n- The withdrawal request matures for coverage pool passes and BMI staking passes and users have 48 hours to withdraw the request.\\n\\nAs Bridge Mutual works towards making DeFi a safe space for users and investors, we\u2019re pleased to be partnering with them on this journey and hope to become an integral part of their operation.\\n\\n**About Bridge Mutual**\\n\\nBridge Mutual, a decentralized coverage platform, is on a mission to become a #1 crypto-armorer of the Decentralized Finance and equip everyone with protection against universal crypto threats. We are a fully decentralized, p2p/p2b discretionary risk coverage platform covering smart contracts, stablecoins, centralized exchanges. Our platform allows users to provide coverage, decide on policy payouts, share profit, and get compensated for adjudicating claims. Users can get protection and provide one in exchange for yield. We focus on great product design, pro-community business objectives and synergy with other web3 innovations.\\n\\n[Website](https://www.bridgemutual.io/) | [Telegram](https://t.me/bridge_mutual) | [Medium](https://bridgemutual.medium.com/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bridge_mutual) | [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bridge-mutual) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/BridgeMutual) | [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/en/trade/BMI_USDT) | [Bitfinex](https://trading.bitfinex.com/t/BMI:USD) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bmi)"},{"id":"push-grants-program-going-live","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-grants-program-going-live","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-26-push-grants-program-going-live/index.md","title":"Push Grants Program Going Live!","description":"Push Grants Program Going Live!","date":"2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 26, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Grants Program","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/grants-program"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"}],"readingTime":2.1433333333333335,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"push-grants-program-going-live","title":"Push Grants Program Going Live!","description":"Push Grants Program Going Live!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"With the overwhelming turnout and support received for PIP-01: Push Grants Program (12% of $PUSH circulating supply taking part in the vote, 3X amount needed for quorum!), PGP is now approved to run for two quarters with a total budget of 1,000,000 $USD.

I got a curious mind for science and stuff and then became interested in computers which was a very theoretical interest back then in the Soviet Union. Then, I went to study computer science in Moscow, where I met Natalia (my Vitalik\u2019s mom) and got married. Then Vitalik was born, and I watched the Soviet Union fall apart, ended up accidentally starting a business with a few friends, eventually moving to Canada 22 years ago, and living here in Toronto, Canada, ever since. I mostly spent most of my life building tech businesses of various kinds, and then a few years ago, I sold the latest business, and I guess you can say that I\u2019m semi-retired and have been engaging in a lot of things that peak my curiosity.\\n\\n**Richa :** Well, you were talking about you growing up in the Soviet Union, so we would love to know what the culture was like back there when you were growing up and how life was back home?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** I mean, generally speaking life was really poor in the Soviet Union so the most you can say is that everyone was equally poor. Most people were more or less in the same position financially, there was a lot of propaganda about how bad the west is and that they were trying to destroy our freedoms and our quest for communism or whatever was happening. So yeah, there was lots of propaganda, lots of family times. Our family had a huge library and I loved reading books and also grew up in a region which had a lot of ethnic tension so that was also part of their background. Those were just some of the little bits and pieces and there are millions of them.\\n\\n**Richa :** Thanks for sharing that story. You briefly mentioned your entrepreneurship career, so we would love to know what your first startup was like and how you feel after becoming an entrepreneur?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Well, when i was growing up, I had no concept of entrepreneurship because entrepreneurship was not a thing in the Soviet Union, in the Soviet Union everything was supposed to be centrally around like, government takes care of everything, provides free education, free healthcare, free apartments, free everything and that sucked, everything sucked, it was all horrible you know because no centralized institution can really hope to you know like, it\u2019s like, imagine if your brain tried to control all of your organs, your feet, your heart, your lungs and everything, it just doesn\u2019t work that way so it was not really working so my point is that there was no concept of entrepreneurship so I didn\u2019t have that in me but then also the Soviet Union fell apart and it was very difficult time for many people because all of their basic structures that supported them you know in some ways and now all of that was just falling apart and it was very difficult but also it gave us lots of freedom, lots of ingenuity and creativity so even as a student then, I ended up having to to make some money by being entrepreneurial a little bit like you know, I would go to different city to buy some stuff and then bring it to this city and try to sell it to people who didn\u2019t have access to it here and stuff like that, so I had a little bit of taste of entrepreneurship while in university and then I worked for a little bit at the bank and then I worked for a big american company and then in a consulting capacity implementing complex IT systems and then I made a good friend (we have been good friends ever since) then who suggested that we should leave that company and we should start our own business so we ended up doing so and I really had no clue what I was doing so we just left that company, the three of us, and then we started our first serious business which was a joint venture with a danish software company, so yeah that was my first business.\\n\\n**Richa :** That\u2019s amazing, so you\u2019ve had so much experience you know bootstrapping companies while running maybe three successful businesses, so what\u2019s some of the lessons that you\u2019ve learned through your experience and what\u2019s your advice for founders who are entering the space now?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** I try to stay away from advice because you know all advice is really specific to a particular moment, particular person, particular situation. In terms of my own lessons there were so many. Entrepreneurship is such an amazing, exciting and challenging journey where you get to learn so much and it will keep challenging you. For me as a guy who grew up basically being \u201call about knowing stuff\u201d, being a nerd, into math and whatever sciences.\\n\\nSo computers were really eye-opening, especially to realize that you can create the perfect technology, piece of software but have nobody to care about it, your business would just die right? So one huge lesson early on was that you have to sell it, you have to promote it and again growing up in the Soviet Union, the whole concept of selling and marketing was totally foreign. As you learn about this, for me as a guy who is smart and technical, it was like \u201coh, I have to talk to people and try to convince them, oh my god this is scary\u201d. But yeah eventually, I found my groove and realized that good selling is not about pushing the stuff that you have created into others but it\u2019s really about understanding what the world needs, what people need to adjust to it.\\n\\nThat\u2019s really for me, the whole concept of capitalism of entrepreneurship, it\u2019s really about solving people\u2019s problems. It\u2019s not anything else. It\u2019s like you try to identify what is the problem, who are the people who have this problem, then try to figure out the solution. Hopefully, this solution is better than other existing solutions. Then you keep listening to your customers to keep improving. You know the solution, you know what you are offering. Make it better, present it better to build up your reputation. That\u2019s really what entrepreneurship is. These were the first wave of lessons.\\n\\nThere are many others, like think of any business however unique it is, but also think about this in a structured way: a business has to build stuff, a business has to sell and market stuff, a business has to have a controlling accounting function and a business has to have a people function.\\n\\nThere are awesome frameworks out there, so it\u2019s really important to think about business. I mean it\u2019s useful, I found that to think about business in a very structured way, so that was another layer of lessons around that. Additionally, of course eventually you realize that a business is built on people. In my personal experience, I\u2019ve been \u201call in\u2019\u2019 tech businesses. In tech businesses you get to work with really smart amazing people. I love working with them but they can also be very hard to work with because if so many of us are smart, we end up over-aligning our brains. We think we know what\u2019s happening and we know it better than anybody else. We\u2019re so much smarter than everybody else but learning humility, learning about human emotions and emotional intelligence and all of the soft skills, that\u2019s a different dimension of learning. An extremely important one.\\n\\nSo in business it\u2019s really about understanding people, understanding why this person is working here. On the surface you can say, you know we pay them money and they do what I tell them but that\u2019s basically because, again in high-tech business if you want to build a successful high-tech business, you work with smart people, smart people who create amazing technologies can find jobs very easily. They\u2019re not really here for whatever money they\u2019re making here, money is useful and important and great resources but it is really important for them to understand why this business exists, what it does, is it making anything good? Are we here just to try to make some money? and spend that money? That\u2019s not exciting, right.\\n\\nThe purpose of a business is extremely important to understand, being human in the business. How we interact with each other as equal human beings versus like an old school hierarchy, \u201coh i\u2019m the important boss, I told you to do this, \u201cgo on\u201d and do this thing right\u201d. This doesn\u2019t work with smart people. They will tell you to \u201cgo on\u201d and go to some other place. This happens all the time.\\n\\nFor me, those learnings were extremely important. The human side of the equation of building technological business. This also brings me to ethereum, a wonderful yet extremely complicated technology. After eight years it\u2019s been around the complexity, unimaginable right?\\n\\nI have a bare superficial grasp of the complexity and the technical aspects of this. But also a really good grasp of the human aspects of ethereum, of all the amazing people of their ecosystem, of all the builders and all their startups. I have a really good sense of what it\u2019s about. That gives me a lot of interest and confidence in what is happening to entrepreneurship.\\n\\nIt\u2019s awesome to have a great technological idea but then mapping that idea to problems people have, mapping that to the mission, the purpose, the correctness of the business. Mapping that to the structure of a business that can unite people that can help support each other. To help people open up to their full potential, that\u2019s exciting stuff!\\n\\n**Harsh :** Definitely!\\n\\n**Richa :** That\u2019s some amazing entrepreneurial and also life lessons, all your experiences thank you so much for sharing all of that.\\n\\n**Harsh:** Awesome, so I think it\u2019s February now, so the new metrics has been one of the\\n\\nearliest adopters to when it comes to crypto, so I just wanted to know what excited you the most about bitcoin and building on that and what was your first reaction when you learned about ethereum?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** I have a curious mind so for me, learning about bitcoin was just an extremely interesting concept. I learned about it pretty much by accident, I think it was mentioned on a podcast that i\u2019ve been listening for many years the podcast was about security of information systems but the guy (Steve Gibson) had a very curious mind and he mentions all these kinds of stuff, he mentioned bitcoin so I looked it up and explored it and it seemed like such a fascinating technology which was trying to create money without any kind of central authority and again, I cannot say that I paid a lot of attention to bitcoin and crypto until Vitalik really got into crypto space and then after seeing his interest in that, I started paying more attention and you know with his involvement and bitcoin magazine i started reading all of the\\n\\nissues of bitcoin magazine and that was one of the skills that Vitalik always had that he could take a very complex thing right and all of those things people were trying to build on top of bitcoin or enhance bitcoin in some ways and then he could explain it really well for relatively non-technical people so i enjoyed learning through all of those articles and eventually eight years ago when Vitalik came up with their concept of Ethereum and i remember like in this very house where i\u2019m sitting right now and he was sitting upstairs at the table and he showed me like \u201coh hey, check it out i\u2019ve been working on this thing you know here\u2019s a little white paper description of what it is and what do you think about this\u201d right and i read the document and even though i only had the superficial knowledge of character but his writing was always very precise and concise and well and you know easy to understand so i\u2019m reading this like, this makes total sense right and I mentioned that a few times that there\u2019s the analogy that came to me and I used it quite a lot but bitcoin like, it was such an awesome invention for digital trustless money, I observed the emergence of internet so i saw the early websites that were built on html, just lines and maybe some colors, some images and then they became this interactive complicated, flashy, complex systems. When the programming languages were added to internet like EB script and javascript and whatnot, and for me ethereum was like, I could see that here\u2019s this technology, but if we add programming language on top of this then it will become infinitely more flexible and you can do so much more with that right, the sky is the limit and then of course I had really no idea how complicated that would be and i guess Vitalik had some idea of how complicated that would be but nobody could have imagined the journey that was undertaken by the idea of ethereum over the last eight years.\\n\\n**Harsh :** Yep, I mean I love that analogy, by the way I read about it but he wanted to hear it again, so like Vitalik is someone we all look up to, his creation, his vision, I mean we are here because you know he created this thing. So, we would like to know a bit more about him, I would love to know how he was like while he was growing up.\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Actually, today a really great article came out on COINTELEGRAPH and I highly recommend that you check it out, I mean it was pretty obvious early on that he was very intelligent, he learned to read very early on, he loved numbers and he learned math and when we gave him our old IBM pc, he started playing with that and microsoft excel became his favorite toy and initially it was just like drawing stuff and typing stuff randomly but then you know he learned different formulas and he started doing stuff so one could see that he really enjoyed learning those abstract concepts and interactions with complex systems and math and stuff like that. So when we moved to Canada, he was only six years old when we started living there and again learning a new language was a bit of a challenge but not a huge deal necessarily. Then he went to school and it was clear to his teachers that he was extremely gifted and then he ended up going to a gifted school and then we also sent him to all kinds of extra curriculum teachers and facilities to help him learn all kinds of stuff and yeah I mean that\u2019s really something specific because there\u2019s so much stuff.\\n\\n**Harsh :** Got it, so let\u2019s go with what\u2019s your favorite or one of your favorite moments with Vitalik?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Like there are so many of them right, but you know any parent knows that when you have children especially, when they are young, you want to buy them toys that you could not afford when you were growing up and i\u2019m no exception so I remember when I was trying to buy him all kinds of lego sets because i used to dream about them and you know in the Soviet Union, there wasn\u2019t much that you could get your hands on. No legos that\u2019s for sure and the funny thing is that when he started playing with them, i think there\u2019s a picture in their article today, like instead of building houses and stuff he was actually building numbers like \u201chere\u2019s five!\u201d \u201chere\u2019s six!\u201d and you know you could see that, numbers, they played a very important part in this, so I mean that\u2019s kind of one of those little moments but again there are so many like teaching him to ride the bike, and you know getting him to try his first burger and all of those things.\\n\\n**Harsh :** That\u2019s so awesome to know. Moving back to butane time, so as an investor and without naming any project geometry can you share any funny or weird experience you had with someone?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** I cannot think of a particular situation, I mean there are times where I talked to a lot of people about a lot of things and the thing is like I find it surprising that for a lot of people it\u2019s hard for them to communicate a specific question because people reach out to me and i don\u2019t mind that at all and i\u2019m very open to people reaching out to communicate and then they give me so much information I look at all of this like \u201doh my god\u201d okay, I don\u2019t like getting overwhelmed and then I always ask him okay what is one specific question that you want me to answer right and it\u2019s really funny because people then have a very hard time answering that and then they try to reiterate like, i did this and blah blah blah and my system like wait all of this is fine this is great like awesome but what is the specific question? like do you want me to invest money into this, do you want this?\\n\\n**Harsh :** That\u2019s so amazing and it\u2019s something that we all can learn from. All right @Demetry, next one okay, this is interesting, so who owns step 3 and what the hell is going on with Jack?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Well, I mean again, people, it\u2019s so interesting because we humans, we try to make some sense out of this world and you know the world, it\u2019s very complex right and we come up with a name and then we came to know what it means and, this means that, and love means this, and happiness means that, you know everyone,s just whipped through the same thing like what the hell is webtree, well it\u2019s our name of a cloud of emerging things that probably has something to do with decentralized technologies and creep the base and blah blah blah and you know the definitions are happening right now and like I\u2019ve never met Jack and I don\u2019t know him but it sounds like Jack is really into the camp of people who think that bitcoin is one and perfect solution to everything right and I don\u2019t really believe that it\u2019s feasible and again it\u2019s really funny because the thing is I understand that in his own world he knows it really well that this is the perfect answer to everything like, in my world I know perfectly well that he\u2019s wrong and you know this is how the world is. We all, each human being, we live in our own world, the world we constructed based on all of our personal knowledge and our brain genetics and whatnot. Human mind wants to find something perfect and static and simple that will keep us safe and happy and whatnot.\\n\\n**Harsh :** Right, so Dmitry my last question to you is that, in these eight years, ethereum has evolved so much so we want to know what is your vision for ethereum going to 2022 and for the upcoming future?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** If we look specifically for 2022, for me I see that we get into the fruition of all this level two technologies to scale Ethereum because again, ethereum is in so much demand that you know all the improvements that are being worked on the base layer are not able to sustain this huge level of demand and this is fine because ethereum again, ecosystem evolved and found a new way to address that right and again i\u2019ve seen that over the years how much research and trial and error and thinking and whatever went into this and there was a plasma and there was this and that, and now we finally have this amazing solutions finally live and people are using them and they\u2019re growing like crazy, so for me 2022 is very likely the era of ethereum L2s, I think and hopefully we will see lots and lots of people using those systems because again they\u2019re much faster, they\u2019re much cheaper and all of that stuff i would also say that we might see the emergence of some new areas of some new types of systems being built on top of decentralized blockchain starting with yorum, i\u2019m thinking about decentralized social media, i\u2019m thinking identity systems and things like that. So it definitely seems like that\u2019s\\n\\ngoing to be happening and in general i\u2019m very excited like all of that stuff for me conceptually is really about giving more opportunities to so many more people around the world, so when Jack talks about like \u201coh vc funded blah blah blah\u201d i don\u2019t really get it, like what the hell is everybody talking about like connection they can learn programming they can do this they can actually go online, they can start using you know systems like polygon, optimal, orbitrum and they can contribute, they can make some money, they can play games like axi infinity make some money there, for me, this is amazing, the empowerment of humans around the world to create, to participate the economy to own their own money, the money that cannot be censored by their governments by anybody else that like i\u2019m so excited for that in 2022 and beyond that like it\u2019s beautiful.\\n\\n**Harsh :** Exactly, I mean that\u2019s something that I feel as well, basically you have the power to create a global bank and all you need is a computer with an internet connection and you can do it from anywhere, this this is actually web3 and this is innovation like if this is not decentralization taking the power away to create bank from anywhere around the world then what is. So yeah I completely agree and this was such a fun interview Dmitry but we are not done yet, we do have a surprise sound of questions that are rapid fire which are prepared by Richa and customized to each and every person so yeah now Richa onto you.\\n\\n**Richa :** Yeah sure thanks Harsh, so these are just very fun rapid questions that i\u2019ll ask you, just take five-ten seconds to answer so if you\u2019re ready we can start.\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Sure!\\n\\n**Richa :** Awesome, so what\u2019s the best piece of advice you have received?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Understand that your own perspective is always biased, that\u2019s some solid advice.\\n\\n**Richa :** Can you show us something from your workspace right now?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** I\u2019m in my bedroom so, I don\u2019t have anything here.\\n\\n**Richa :** We\u2019ll keep it for the next times, What is one hobby of Vitalik that we all don\u2019t know about?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** He\u2019s a pretty good player of Gore, you know that game?\\n\\n**Richa :** Awesome, Who came up with the name Vitalik and why?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** We came up with this name between myself and his mom, i barely remember how that happened, a number of factors but i think one of them was that i had a childhood friend, he was a bit older and a very awesome guy who was a little bit of a mentor being a few years older to me when i was getting into electronics and stuff like that so that was his name so somehow that name felt good to me.\\n\\n**Richa :** Nice cool,and what\u2019s your favorite food?\\n\\n**Dmitry:** There are so many, I love so many different types of food it\u2019s hard for me to find just\\n\\none but I love pastry I\u2019ll go with pastry croissants.\\n\\n**Richa:** We\u2019ll take that croissants, awesome, what\u2019s the first thing that comes to your mind when i say the following words, Russia?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Pain\\n\\n**Richa :** NFTs\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Beauty\\n\\n**Richa :** What do you like to do, Sing or Dance?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Sing, that feels more natural to me.\\n\\n**Richa :** Awesome, would you like to sing something?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Not really.\\n\\n**Richa :** All right, speed or decentralization your pick?\\n\\n**Dmitry:** Decentralization. I\u2019m a big believer in long-term solutions like life is not a sprint, life is a marathon.\\n\\n**Richa:** Yeah, multichain?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** Whatever happens reality will know better.\\n\\n**Richa :** Awesome, really be on the lookout for that, uh your top three projects of ethereum are?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** MakerDAO, Uniswap and i\u2019ll say AAVE\\n\\n**Richa :** All the OGs and finally, Dmitry, what does ethereum mean to you?\\n\\n**Dmitry :** For me, it\u2019s a movement for really bright adn smart people who want to change the world for the better and who are doing this in a way that they\u2019re having fun, nobody\u2019s controlling and nobody is structuring that it\u2019s very messy, it\u2019s very disorganized, it\u2019s very inefficient, it\u2019s nothing like a well organized VC funded corporation/startup whatever, but it\u2019s so beautiful, it\u2019s so resilient, it\u2019s so creative that it\u2019s unstoppable.\\n\\n**Harsh :** Awesome, alright so this brings us to the end of the interview, thank you so much Dmitry for coming over here and for sharing some of the really cool answers, now we get to know Vitalik a bit more and we get to know about your journey in such a glorious fashion, all right, i think we can wrap it up over here and to all our viewers see you next time bye!\\n\\nHere is the link to the youtube video if you want to watch the whole interview : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v1wzCkS9G4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v1wzCkS9G4)"},{"id":"how-to-get-started-with-epns","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/how-to-get-started-with-epns","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-25-how-to-get-started-with-epns/index.md","title":"How to Get Started with EPNS (for Devs!)","description":"How to Get Started with EPNS (for Devs!)","date":"2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 25, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Developer","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/developer"}],"readingTime":3.0633333333333335,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-to-get-started-with-epns","title":"How to Get Started with EPNS (for Devs!)","description":"How to Get Started with EPNS (for Devs!)","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"EPNS is an open-source, decentralized notification protocol.

They offer fiat level stability to investors while being transparent and secure like cryptocurrencies, making for a reliable medium of exchange within DeFi. But, as the number of users and their utility within DeFi started to grow, the inherent problems with stable coins started to surface.\\n\\nWhile the largest stablecoin projects like USDC and USDT remain centralized, the decentralized ones like Maker and Synthetix run on complex structures where the 1:1 convertibility of collateral against stablecoins is not possible. Additionally, there is no decentralized protocol that allows hassle-free minting of stablecoins, especially those pegged to the Euro.\\n\\nIn this regard, Angle Protocol is a decentralized platform striving to make a change and democratize the stablecoin market to build a bankless future. We at EPNS are pleased to announce our partnership with Angle Protocol to enable their democratization efforts by building a reliable communication channel for users and the protocol.\\n\\n### How Angle Protocol Can Benefit from EPNS\\n\\nAngle is the first-ever fully decentralized, capital-efficient, and over-collateralized stablecoin platform in DeFi. The primary goal of Angle Protocol is to enable the minting of stable assets tradable over the blockchain. It lets investors buy stablecoins with collateral of their choice and also convert the stablecoins back into collateral. This means that Angle is among the first protocols to achieve the 1:1 convertibility of collateral against stablecoins.\\n\\nAngle can be used to issue any stablecoin on the blockchain. It has launched agEUR, the biggest Euro stablecoin in the market, and aims to create stablecoins for Forex currencies in the near future. To achieve this ambitious goal, the protocol requires hedging agents (HA) who provide liquidity to the protocol and bear the volatility of the underlying by holding perpetual futures. HA\u2019s benefit the rise in prices of the collateral assets and protect the protocol from price drops.\\n\\nSo, it goes without saying that for Angle Protocol to function smoothly, there needs to be a way for the protocol to communicate with its HA seamlessly. And, EPNS provides that way through decentralized push notifications.\\n\\n# What Does the Partnership Entail\\n\\nThrough our pilot partnership with Angle Protocol, we aim to build a proper medium for the protocol to be able to communicate with its HAs. Angle Protocol will now have an official channel on the EPNS platform that the users of the protocol, especially HAs can subscribe to.\\n\\nIn doing so, they benefit from direct communication from the protocol without the need for external media.\\n\\n- Whenever perpetual futures near liquidation HAs are warned to re-collateralize their positions.\\n- If their position is in danger of force-closing, HAs are informed beforehand.\\n- Standard liquidity providers are informed whenever a high yielding opportunity emerges and\\n- Lastly, users are informed as to how rewards are being distributed every week.\\n\\nAs Angle Protocol strives towards revolutionizing the stablecoin space, we\u2019re pleased to be partnering with them on this journey and hope to become an integral part of their operation.\\n\\n**About Angle Protocol**\\n\\nAngle is the first over-collateralized, decentralized, and capital-efficient stablecoin protocol. Thanks to the liquidity providers it uses, the protocol proposes full convertibility between stable assets and collateral, meaning that it is possible to swap collateral against stable assets, and stable assets against collateral at oracle value. This makes the protocol not only capital-efficient but also highly liquid.\\n\\n| [Website](https://www.angle.money/) | [Medium](https://blog.angle.money/) |"},{"id":"epns-x-aave-protection","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-x-aave-protection","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-24-epns-x-aave-protection/index.md","title":"EPNS x AAVE: Protection Against Asset Liquidation","description":"EPNS x AAVE: Protection Against Asset Liquidation","date":"2022-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 24, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Aave","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/aave"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"}],"readingTime":1.6533333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-x-aave-protection","title":"EPNS x AAVE: Protection Against Asset Liquidation","description":"EPNS x AAVE: Protection Against Asset Liquidation","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Up until 2015, cryptocurrencies were considered to be mere luxuries or collectibles for the rich.

But with the launch of the Ethereum Network and its smart contracts, the perception around digital assets began to change. Ethereum based protocols brought bank-like services onto the blockchain and made them even better with global accessibility, transparency, and security.\\n\\nAmong the protocols that contributed to the unprecedented success of DeFi is AAVE. This decentralized lending platform became the heart of DeFi, contributing to a significant part of the total volume locked.\\n\\nWith its innovative financial services, AAVE also managed to bring in an influx of new users to DeFi. But, the lack of a reliable communication system in DeFi created a void between the users and the network. The user-experience was poor and all updates had to be checked manually. This caused users to miss out on significant updates pertaining to their investments and loans.\\n\\nBut, integrating into AAve decentralized push notifications through EPNS can change this for good.\\n\\n### How EPNS x AAVE Could Change Communication in DeFi\\n\\nAs mentioned before, AAVE is a non-custodial lending and yield farming protocol for DeFi. The protocol has a variety of liquidity pools funded by liquidity providers and borrowers are required to deposit collateral to obtain loans. However, in cases where the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold, it is liquidated to protect the lender. But because there is no means of direct communication between the protocol and users, borrowers end up realizing the liquidation long after it\u2019s done. In this situation, they are in no position to take action and end up losing their collateral. This is where EPNS comes into play. We\u2019ve managed to build a robust, reliable communication channel for AAve users and the network to always stay one step ahead and keep your assets safe.\\n\\nBorrowers on AAVE can subscribe to the channel to get notified whenever their collateral is at risk of being liquidated. This new communication channel will play a huge role in catapulting the success of AAVE by reducing the friction between users and the network and increasing user participation.\\n\\nA simple communication mechanism like this, could hugely benefit both the users and the protocol. Users would have a significantly improved user-experience where they no longer are worried or constantly in need of manually checking updates. For the protocol, this means increased user-engagement, increased decentralization, and overall better communication with its users.\\n\\n# The Way Forward\\n\\nDeFi\u2019s lending protocols with their yield farming opportunities and higher rewards shaped the foundations of the industry itself. They transformed the way global financial markets perceived digital assets and cemented their place in the bigger picture. We aim to collaborate with many more DeFi protocols to increase the ease of communication in the industry. By doing so, we aim to safeguard user assets and their newfound trust in DeFi."},{"id":"epns-and-atlantis-world-collaborate","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-and-atlantis-world-collaborate","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-14-epns-and-atlantis-world-collaborate/index.md","title":"EPNS and Atlantis World Collaborate To Build a Communication Layer for the Social Metaverse","description":"EPNS and Atlantis World Collaborate To Build a Communication Layer for the Social Metaverse","date":"2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Partnerships","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/partnerships"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Defi","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/defi"},{"label":"FAQ","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/faq"}],"readingTime":2.0766666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-and-atlantis-world-collaborate","title":"EPNS and Atlantis World Collaborate To Build a Communication Layer for the Social Metaverse","description":"EPNS and Atlantis World Collaborate To Build a Communication Layer for the Social Metaverse","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"The impending dawn of the Metaverse is creating waves of excitement among people across the globe.

With promises of fully immersive virtual worlds where everything is possible, the Metaverse is poised to bring significant changes to our world.\\n\\nIn this context, Atlantis World is a social metaverse project that aims to build immersive experiences for the world of DeFi in an effort to improve user experiences and make the industry more appealing. We\u2019re pleased to announce our collaboration with this emergent project through which we hope to build a communication layer for the Metaverse.\\n\\n### How Atlantis World Could Benefit from EPNS\\n\\nAs mentioned before, Atlantis world is a futuristic project fabricating a new social metaverse for Web3. This brand new project believes that the DeFi industry in its present state lacks that immersive user experiences to appeal to the majority of the population. But, by building immersive virtual worlds and gamifying DeFi\u2019s core concepts, the industry as a whole could progress to an exciting new dimension. This is exactly what Altantis World aims to achieve.\\n\\nThe project is building an immersive social metaverse with a full-fledged virtual economy integrated into it. The project features virtual banks where liquidity can be unlocked and used within the metaverse to buy, sell, trade, and transfer digital assets. With a clever integration of cryptocurrencies and NFTs into virtual gaming worlds, Atlantis world aims to take staking, yield farming, and trading in DeFi to a whole new level that is appealing to the masses.\\n\\nMoreover, when compared to other metaverse projects that require sophisticated hardware to enter the metaverse, Atlantis world is built to run on any device or web browser across the world. The project calls this a \u201clightweight 2D metaverse\u201d that is more practical and feasible to an average person.\\n\\nOn this journey of creating immersive user experiences, the role of push notifications is invaluable. It is through push notifications that users can stay updated with the happenings of the Metaverse and promptly engage with protocols. And through our collaboration with Atlantis World, we aim to make this possible.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nBy teaming up with Atlantis World, we at EPNS are working towards building an ultimate communication layer for the social metaverse that is about to unfold. The utilities of such a communication layer are practically endless. It creates a two-way interaction channel and allows users to actively engage with the metaverse.\\n\\nAtlantis World will have an official channel on EPNS that users can subscribe to, to receive push notifications that help them keep a track of digital assets and progress on the Metaverse. As the project continues to grow and evolve, EPNS will explore the best possible ways in which notifications can be integrated into the metaverse to keep users at the center of the action.\\n\\nWe\u2019re enthralled to be partnering with Atlantis World on their journey to transform DeFi and hope to be an integral part of their operations.\\n\\n**About Atlantis World**\\n\\nAtlantis World is building the Web3 social metaverse. The project connects DeFi with Web3 (NFTs, DeFi + DAOs) and gaming inside of a lightweight virtual world that\u2019s accessible to everybody, to make the industry more appealing.\\n\\nAtlantis World curates a fully-fledged crypto economy of the metaverse starting with game experiences that plug into Web3 applications. Users can even visit digital banks and unlock billions of dollars in liquidity for anything from savings accounts to borrowing, or freely exchange money and trade anything from financial instruments to NFT wearables and other digital goods/collectibles such as land.\\n\\n| [Website](https://atlantis.world/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/atlantis0x) | [Telegram](https://t.me/atlwrld) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/atlantisworld)"},{"id":"just-what-can-you-use-epns-for","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/just-what-can-you-use-epns-for","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-13-just-what-can-you-use-epns-for/index.md","title":"Just What Can You Use EPNS For?","description":"Just What Can You Use EPNS For?","date":"2022-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 13, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Mainnet","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/mainnet"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Communication","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/communication"}],"readingTime":1.5666666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"just-what-can-you-use-epns-for","title":"Just What Can You Use EPNS For?","description":"Just What Can You Use EPNS For?","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We\u2019re pretty excited that the EPNS mainnet has launched.

So let\u2019s dive in:\\n\\n# EPNS for DeFi \ud83d\udcb0\\n\\nRight now, you can subscribe to receive notifications from the top DeFi projects in the space. Notifications are sent for either liquidation dangers or governance updates.\\n\\nThe **MakerDAO** channel sends notifications whenever there are new governance proposals.\\n\\nThe **Crypto Volatility Index (CVI)** channel sends out notifications about market volatility to protect LPs from impermanent loss.\\n\\nThe **Bancor** channel notifies users when liquidity mining campaigns begin or near closure, and notifies subscribers about new governance proposals.\\n\\nThe **Oasis** channel notifies subscribers when their vaults are reaching a high risk of liquidation.\\n\\nThe **Mover** channel notifies you about your yield harvested on the platform.\\n\\n# EPNS for Domains and Governance \ud83d\udda5\\n\\nNever miss an update from some of the leading protocols in Web3 offering critical consumer applications and infrastructure.\\n\\nThe **ENS** channel notifies users when their domains are about to expire. No more needing to set manual calendar reminders!\\n\\nThe **Snapshot** channel notifies you when governance proposals are made from the projects you follow on Snapshot.\\n\\n# EPNS for Traders and Investors \ud83d\udcc8\\n\\nAll the information you need to trade and invest intelligently, delivered to an EPNS inbox near you.\\n\\nThe **ETH Tracker** and **BTC Tracker** channels notify subscribers every 6 hours of the token prices.\\n\\nThe **ETH Gas Tracker** channel tells users when ETH gas prices hit new highs, letting you more intelligently place those trades.\\n\\n# EPNS for Media and News \ud83d\uddde\\n\\nWe\u2019re proud to have partnered with **CoinDesk** to launch the first media channel on EPNS. Users will be notified whenever a news story goes live.\\n\\nAnd there you have it! And yet, that\u2019s only the beginning. Expect a lot more channels and notifications to go live in the days, weeks, and months to come. Let\u2019s #PUSH it!\\n\\n_\\\\*Note: the EPNS protocol has been under development for 1+ year, and completed a_ [_ChainSafe audit_](https://epns.io/EPNS-Protocol-Audit2021.pdf) _in October 2021.

A guide to getting started with EPNS._\\n\\nThe EPNS mainnet launched on January 11! We\u2019re thankful to the community for building with us over the last years, and we\u2019re excited for this next phase of decentralized, Web3 communication.\\n\\nSo, now that EPNS is launched \u2014 what should you do? Check out the guide below to figure out how to get started, whether you want to send or receive notifications.\\n\\n# Channel or Subscriber \u2014 Who Are You?\\n\\nUsers of EPNS are classified into two groups: **channels** and **subscribers.**\\n\\n**Channels** are users who send out notifications. **Subscribers** are those who elect to receive notifications from certain channels. Businesses, dapps, and even individuals can all be channels; they can program notifications to be sent in response to on-chain information, and/or send notifications manually for off-chain activities. Subscribers opt-in to receive notifications from any of these channels. All of this happens through the [app.epns.io](http://app.epns.io) site.\\n\\n# Channels: How to Start Sending Notifications\\n\\nTo start sending out notifications, businesses, DEXs, and other protocols in DeFi need to create a dedicated channel. They can choose to create one of the three types of channels \u2014 open, closed, and mutual. An open channel is open for anyone to subscribe and start receiving notifications. If the channel creator wants a specific user to subscribe to their channel, they can pay a small fee to the subscriber and add them indirectly. The subscriber is of course free to opt-out of this subscription.\\n\\nA closed channel, on the other hand, is not universally open. Only users of the channel creator\u2019s choice get added to this channel. The mutual channel sits in between both these channels. Users can request to subscribe and the channel creator can either accept or reject their proposal.\\n\\nThe process of creating a channel on EPNS is quite simple and usually a one-time setup.\\n\\n- Users who want to create a channel are recommended to do it either from the EPNS dApp or the EPNS JS library. But apart from this, channels can also be created using custom JS libraries.\\n- To begin, users are required to visit [http://staging-app.epns.io/](http://staging-app.epns.io/)\\n- They are then prompted to connect to their crypto wallet, either Metamask, Ledger, or Portis.\\n- Once this is done, they can click on \u201ccreate your channel\u201d and upload the channel logo.\\n- To activate the channel, users are required to stake DAI tokens to contribute to the interest generating staking pool on AAVE. 50 DAI is the minimum stake fees and the more DAI that is staked, the more interest can be generated by a channel. Which inturn is used to incentivize subscribers.\\n- Once the DAI is staked, users can give their channel a name, a description, and click on \u201csetup channel\u201d to activate it.\\n\\n# How Subscribers Can Receive Notifications\\n\\nNow that the channels are created, users can start subscribing to them.\\n\\nEPNS provides a mobile application and a dApp to ensure that users receive notifications on time. The mobile app uses EPNS Infra to convert decentralized notifications into their centralized format that can be received on ios and Android devices. Unlike the boring web 2.0 notifications that only consist of text, EPNS notifications can consist of images, videos, and links. This takes the whole notification game to the next level, making it interesting for users to interact with.\\n\\nThe dApp brings notifications from web browsers and decentralized carriers. The combination of the dApp and app allows users to stay up to date with all the happenings of the market irrespective of the device they use. To subscribe to a channel,\\n\\n- Users can visit [https://app.epns.io/](https://app.epns.io/)\\n- Once on the website, they connect their crypto wallet to begin the process.\\n- EPNS has a dedicated channels page that houses all the created channels and users can access this page by clicking on \u201cchannels\u201d.\\n- Users can them browse the page for channels of their choice and click \u201csubscribe\u201d to start getting notifications from that particular channel.\\n\\nIn the next phase of the protocol, EPNS aims to launch incentivized notifications for users. The DAI used to create a channel is staked in a staking pool on AAVE and the interest generated is redistributed to all the subscribers of the channel. This means that users get rewarded for choosing to interact with the protocols.\\n\\n# What Does it Mean for the DeFi Ecosystem?\\n\\nIncentivized push notifications could do wonders for the DeFi ecosystem. The DeFi and Web 3.0 space today are quite fragmented, to say the least. There is no means for businesses and users to communicate with each other or among themselves. But EPNS is about to change that for good. We have created a reliable, robust communications layer that is poised to bring all the players of web 3.0 onto a single platform. Businesses can effectively reach their target consumers without waiting for them to reach out. With this, the existing communication gap disappears, driving user engagement and collaboration. This in turn can transform the course of the DeFi ecosystem for the better.\\n\\n_Note: the EPNS protocol has been under development for over a year, and completed a_ [_ChainSafe audit_](https://epns.io/EPNS-Protocol-Audit2021.pdf) _in April 2021.

CEXes offer users easy onboarding to crypto concepts, simple UI to start buying tokens, and the most user-friendly ways to on- and off-board into Web3 applications.\\n\\nOne such exchange is Huobi Global. With a market cap of over $1.6 billion, this China-based CeFi platform has provided an easy on-ramp for millions of people across the globe to jump into the crypto revolution. Now, with Huobi\u2019s integration of EPNS decentralized push notifications, the platform is spreading its wings into the DeFi world as well.\\n\\n### The Communication Benefits and Drawbacks of CEXes\\n\\n1.  CEXes like Huobi are constantly listing new tokens, issuing communications about existing tokens, launching new incentives, announcing interest-earning capabilities, and more.\\n2.  The only method of communication CEXes have are the channels that most companies have, like Twitter, Telegram, Discord, blogs, and email.\\n3.  Though this has worked for many years, it\u2019s not the _optimal method_ of communication. Huobi (and other centralized exchanges) stand to benefit from a decentralized communication method where they can send notifications directly to the growing number of Web3.\\n4.  The future of crypto we should acknowledge is even more seamless relationships between centralized and decentralized ecosystems, where people feel empowered to move between them as they see fit, without barriers or silos in their way.\\n5.  EPNS offers this decentralized communication opportunity to Huobi, opening up not only a brand new era for Huobi to interact with Web3, but also for Web3 users to respond more effectively to actions taken by one of the world\u2019s leading exchanges.\\n\\n# EPNS x Huobi\\n\\n1.  The flagship collaboration between Huobi and EPNS will launch a token notification channel. Subscribers to this channel will be notified whenever a critical action occurs regarding a token on Huobi Exchange. At launch, this includes when a new token is listed or when a token sale is occurring or upcoming.\\n2.  As many of us know, the ability and foresight to invest in a token prior to its listing on a centralized exchange can yield higher returns. A decentralized communication channel that connects to these types of announcements from Huobi will enable Web3 users to more immediately respond to listings of tokens \u2014 a much better UX than hoping to stumble across a tweet or actively searching for announcements.\\n3.  On the other side of the coin, Huobi is opening itself up to communication with the entirety of Web3, which is a vast and rapidly growing ecosystem. By pioneering the relationship between centralized and decentralized communities, Huobi will be able early on to capture the audiences that are seeking to know what CEXes are doing in order to influence their own actions.\\n\\n# Uniting the Two Branches of the Crypto Industry\\n\\nHuobi began its journey as a crypto exchange back in 2013 when the concept of digital assets was still quite new to people. Today, Huobi facilitates the trading of a plethora of cryptocurrencies and is known to list tokens with promising potential very early on. Along with this, Huobi also offers Spot and Derivatives trading for its users.\\n\\nHowever, because Huobi Global is a centralized crypto exchange, the users of DeFi have been missing out on the opportunities this platform provides. Huobi Global has always had the knack for identifying promising tokens and listing them on its platform way before others. This causes DeFi users to miss out on potential investment opportunities that could be life-changing.\\n\\nThis is precisely why Huobi Global opted to integrate EPNS push notifications. Users of DeFi will now have a window into the world of CeFi with this integration. Every time a promising new token is listed on the platform, DeFi users are intimated of the same through decentralized push notifications. This allows them to stay relevant in the world of investments and take a share of the profit pie.\\n\\n# Collaborating for Collective Progress\\n\\nThe feud between decentralized finance and traditional finance is not new to anyone in the world. But even with the world of decentralization, there is an ongoing battle between CeFi and DeFi. While both of these have advantages and disadvantages of their own, it is important for both branches of the crypto industry to unite for collective progress. In this regard, Huobi\u2019s integration of EPNS could be the first step forward. By creating a reliable communication platform between a CeFi platform and DeFi users, EPNS facilitates the easy flow of information to unite CeFi and DeFi."},{"id":"the-epns-mainnet-is-here","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/the-epns-mainnet-is-here","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-11-the-epns-mainnet-is-here/index.md","title":"The EPNS Mainnet is Here!","description":"The EPNS Mainnet is Here!","date":"2022-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 11, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Mainnet","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/mainnet"},{"label":"Live","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/live"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"}],"readingTime":1.49,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-epns-mainnet-is-here","title":"The EPNS Mainnet is Here!","description":"The EPNS Mainnet is Here!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"As of today, January 11, at 4 PM UTC, the Ethereum Push Notification Service is live on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet!","tags":["Mainnet","Live","Ethereum","Notifications","Web3"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EPNS x Huobi Global: Never Miss a Token Listing","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-x-huobi"},"nextItem":{"title":"Push Grants Program.. it\u2019s here!","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/push-grants-program-here"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of The EPNS Mainnet is Here!](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**As of today, January 11, at 4 PM UTC, the Ethereum Push Notification Service is live on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet!**\\n\\nThis is an exciting moment for EPNS, and we know you\u2019re itching to get started.

The protocol can be used by two broad audiences: **channels** and **subscribers.**\\n\\n**Channels** are dapps, users, and businesses that want to send notifications to others. These notifications can be sent manually, or they can be built to respond automatically to on-chain or off-chain information. For example, a media company can push out alerts for breaking news when a story is released. Or, a DeFi project can allow users to automatically receive notifications when their loans are closing in on liquidation.\\n\\n_How to get started as a channel?_ Head to [app.epns.io](http://app.epns.io) and \u2018Create Your Channel\u2019. Follow the guided steps to set up your channel, create notifications, and publish your channel to mainnet. Then, watch the subscribers roll in. If you need support, head to [How to EPNS](https://www.notion.so/epns/How-to-EPNS-853afe64839b4cdd8c63209342a783d0) for more information.\\n\\n**Subscribers** are those who wish to receive notifications from others. Subscribers can browse the live channels on EPNS through the app, and opt-in to receive notifications from any of them. Notifications are then delivered to the subscriber\u2019s \u2018inbox\u2019.

That process will last at least 5 days, then once any revisions are completed we\u2019ll submit it to a formal Push Improvement Proposal (the inaugural \u201cPIP-01\u201d)\\n\\nAll delegated $PUSH holders will then have the opportunity to vote for it on Snapshot.

However, the current model for trading cryptocurrencies on these exchanges has its own problems. For starters, the token has to be listed on the exchange and has to cross a certain trading volume to achieve liquidity. This creates a scenario where several small-cap cryptocurrencies have no liquidity.\\n\\nTo circumvent this problem, came Bancor Network in 2017. And we at EPNS are pleased to announce our integration with Bancor Network to provide push notifications for users.\\n\\n### How Bancor Network Could Benefit from EPNS\\n\\nThe Bancor Network is a blockchain-agnostic decentralized finance protocol that allows users to trade tokens without the need for an order book. It essentially consists of open-source liquidity pools that serve as an endpoint for automated market making. Bancor\u2019s smart contracts manage all these liquidity pools and execute the conversion of tokens on-chain to remove the need for order books.\\n\\nOne of the main aims of this platform is to eliminate the need for middlemen by facilitating automatic token trades across blockchains. But, in doing so, it also aims to provide liquidity to tokens by incentivizing users for creating and providing liquidity to pools of these coins. Each liquidity pool on this network consists of a trading pair and a reserve of BNT tokens. BNT tokens are the native tokens of the Bancor network and are used as intermediate currency while trading tokens. Liquidity providers (LP) can deposit assets into the pool to begin earning yield.\\n\\nThe best part is that users can provide just a single token and maintain single-token exposure. For reference, most popular protocols require LPs to provide liquidity for both tokens in the trading pair. Bancor\u2019s single token approach significantly reduces the entry barriers to DeFi and also removes the risk of impermanent loss. When LPs provide liquidity they receive special pool tokens that are linked to smart contracts containing reserves of other ERC-20 tokens.\\n\\nWhile Bancor network has had remarkable success with its vision so far, the lack of a proper communication channel between users and the network creates friction. For instance, users have to manually check for new token listings, liquidity mining updates, and governance proposals. In the long run, this could reduce user participation.\\n\\nThis is why we\u2019ve integrated with Bancor Network to create a reliable communication channel for the protocol and its users.\\n\\n# What Does the Integration Entail?\\n\\nThrough this integration, we aim to equip users of Bancor with decentralized push notifications. Bancor Network will now have an official channel on EPNS that users can subscribe to. By subscribing, users get notified whenever:\\n\\n- liquidity mining begins or approaches closure\\n- there are any fee changes on the platform\\n- there are new governance proposals on Snapshot\\n- new tokens are listed on the platform\\n\\nThis ensures that users are always kept informed about the latest happenings in the protocol and can improve their participation significantly.\\n\\nAs Bancor Network continues to provide DeFi with revolutionary financial products, we\u2019re pleased to integrate with the protocol on their journey and hope to become an integral part of the protocol.\\n\\n# About Bancor Protocol\\n\\n[Bancor](https://bancor.network/) is the only decentralized staking protocol that allows you to earn money with single-token exposure and full protection from impermanent loss. Launched in 2017, Bancor was the first DeFi protocol. Today, it generates millions in fees per month for depositors, offering up to 60% APR on tokens like ETH, WBTC, LINK, MATIC, AAVE & more. Bancor is owned by its community as a decentralized autonomous organization (Bancor DAO).

This technology made it possible for a network of participants from different parts of the world who do not know each other to collaborate and run the blockchain network. All without the need for centralized authorities.\\n\\nThe participants can make decisions on how the blockchain should evolve, how the tokens should be distributed, and how the blockchain network should handle itself in the face of unforeseen events through a robust process called blockchain governance. Now, for blockchain governance to be truly effective, it requires the broad participation of stakeholders, i.e. the users of the network or protocol. But the lack of a reliable communication channel between the network and its participants leads to a situation where generally only a small portion of stakeholders participate.\\n\\nTo avoid this situation and ensure greater decentralization, EPNS has worked with participants in various DeFi protocols to enable push notifications for governance updates. The latest to benefit from EPNS push notifications service are participants in the dYdX protocol.\\n\\n# How dYdX Benefits From Decentralized Push Notifications\\n\\ndYdX is a leading non-custodial derivatives exchange that runs on audited smart contracts on Ethereum. The exchange combines the security and transparency of a decentralized exchange, with the speed and usability of a centralized exchange. To significantly scale trading, dYdX Trading Inc. and StarkWare built a Layer 2 protocol for cross-margined crypto assets perpetual contracts, based on StarkWare\u2019s StarkEx scalability engine and dYdX Trading\u2019s perpetual smart contracts. Traders can now trade with zero gas costs, lower trading fees, and reduced minimum trade sizes.\\n\\nWith this context, participants in the dYdX protocol constantly strive to improve the protocol to meet the demands of the ever-growing crypto industry. To do so, it requires further participation of its users who can readily vote on decisions pertaining to platform governance when proposals are made to change it.\\n\\nThe governance process on dYdX is powered by community governance forums and implemented through dYdX Improvement Proposals (DIPs). Anyone can use the governance forum and create a proposal, which is initially off-chain and is called the dYdX Request for Comments (DRC). Once the DRC is posted on the forum, community members can participate in discussions pertaining to it and any member who holds more than 10K DYDX tokens can create an off-chain poll for the DRC. Consensus regarding the DRC should be achieved within 5 days through a process of voting.\\n\\nOnce a consensus is reached off-chain, a DIP is created on-chain again by a user with enough proposing power. After a short period of voting delay, voting for the DIP is activated and users can vote on it. If the DIP passes, it is queued, and later implemented.\\n\\nA close look at this governance process reveals that there needs to be proper communication at every step between those seeking to implement changes to the protocol and its participants who must approve those changes to ensure a smooth governance and voting process with maximum participation. This is where EPNS push notifications come into the picture.\\n\\n# What Does the EPNS Implementation Entail\\n\\nThrough our work with the dYdX Foundation, we aim to build a robust communication channel through which participants in dYdX protocol governance can remain updated at every step of the governance process. Currently, dYdX stakeholders can subscribe to receive notifications when\\n\\n- a DRC is created,\\n- the voting process for DRC begins,\\n- a DIP is created,\\n- the voting for the DIP is activated,\\n- the DIP is queued, and\\n- the DIP is implemented.\\n\\nIn the future, the EPNS team is working to provide notifications for dYdX stakeholders when\\n\\n- an epoch begins,\\n- an epoch ends,\\n- rewards become claimable,\\n- a Snapshot poll is created, and\\n- the voting for a Snapshot poll begins.\\n\\nAs the dYdX protocol continues to be revolutionary for perpetual contracts trading in DeFi, we are pleased to work with them to ensure the smooth running of their governance process in an effort to improve the dYdX protocol and participation in its governance. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of the dYdX ecosystem.\\n\\n# About dYdX Foundation\\n\\nThe dYdX Foundation is an independent not-for-profit foundation headquartered in Zug, Switzerland. By fostering decentralized governance and assisting to empower traders with powerful, transparent, and open crypto financial products, the dYdX Foundation will help push the dYdX Layer 2 protocol forwards towards community-led growth, development, and self-sustainability.

And not just us, for the entire crypto space. It was the year when the world finally opened up to crypto, blockchain, DeFi, and all their use cases. Along with the fundamental changes also arrived the age of L2 scaling and NFTs, pushing blockchain and crypto further into the mainstream.\\n\\nAlongside all the massive developments that the crypto space accomplished altogether, EPNS too has been growing at a rapid pace. From our Token Generation Event giving birth to our native token $PUSH to hitting important milestones, to say 2021 was a thrilling year would be a massive understatement. Some major milestones we reached include protocol audit, Community Incentives Programs, the EPNS Governance launch, community growth with EPNS Rockstars, mobile app launch, SDKs, the EPNS browser extension release, and project collaborations with some of the most renowned protocols in the space!\\n\\nThat being said, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without our super supportive community that kept pushing us for the best in us. We are humbled by the love and support that we have received from the EPNS and wider Ethereum community. We love you all. A HUGE Kudos to the EPNS team as well for working tirelessly day in and day out to make EPNS the truly robust, reliant, and decentralized communication protocol for Web3.\\n\\nWelcome to the EPNS 2021 Rewind, where we summarize our journey and highlights in the past year, reminiscing how much we\u2019ve grown as a project.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f And then it Began \u2014 The $PUSH Token Genesis \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\n- Token Generation Event\\n- Liquidity mining\\n- Airdrop to our early adopters and community members\\n\\nAs the year kicked off, EPNS took huge steps. It all started with a genesis \u2014 the Token Generation Event of $PUSH. It was no mean feat! It was the culmination of months of hard work combined with thorough discussions and feedback from members of the community, advisors and investors regarding the overall tokenomics of $PUSH. The token generation was followed by the initiation of the [Liquidity Rewards Program](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-liquidity-rewards-program-d16ff2c0fef4). The Rewards program launched with two pools: The PUSH Staking Pool and the Uniswap LP Pool, allowing users to participate in yield farming and liquidity mining opportunities with $PUSH.\\n\\nOver the months that followed the TGE, $PUSH got listed on highly popular crypto exchanges like Huobi, KuCoin, Uniswap, ParaSwap, WazirX, MEXC, ZebPay, Gate.io, Bitbns.\\n\\nThis truly was an exciting time for the team, and so was it for the community as it marked the beginning of EPNS\u2019s push (pun totally intended) to become the world\u2019s first decentralized notifications & Web3 communication protocol.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f Frens Coming Together \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nAs we built the world\u2019s first decentralized web3 notifications and communications protocol, we realized that it was time to put EPNS to heavy testing and start onboarding more participants to the protocol! So, we partnered with numerous decentralized protocols to start working with them as part of our pilot program and implementing channels for their various use cases. The pilot program gradually grew into something we did not imagine. By the end of 2021, we were working with a number of household DeFi and Web3 projects joining the list. We are super excited to be able to integrate EPNS with our fellow partners and thrilled to be working with some of the best minds in the industry and bringing push notifications for their users.\\n\\n<iframe

ew\\">Symphony Finance</strong></a></p>\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f Following the Roadmap: Building the Tech! \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nAs the EPNS community grew and flourished over the year, so did our tech! Building a community is one thing, building the tech to deliver our promise for a decentralized web3 notifications protocol is another. In the past months, we\u2019ve followed our Roadmap carefully and executed sequentially to eventually lead up to our soon-to-come Mainnet launch!\\n\\n![First Image of Our 2021 Year in Review \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nIn Q1, while our main focus was to get prepared and successfully complete our Smart Contracts Audit and everything surrounding the Token Generation Event, we also made great improvements in our frontends and worked on providing tooling for developers to start experimenting with the protocol. By the end of Q1, we ended up by successfully launching our token together with our incentives website and our ROCKSTARS of EPNS NFTs initiative for the community to participate.\\n\\nDuring Q2, a lot of our efforts were towards establishing collaborations with some of the most important protocols in the space. We started working on our strategic pilot partnerships and collabs with some of the major Defi protocols and communities in the ecosystem, these include Uniswap, AAVE, Alpha Homora, TrueFi, Gitcoin, Polygon, Superfluid, Biconomy, and much much more!\\n\\nQ2 also saw the release of the EPNS browser extension (allowing you to receive notifications on your browser as well), [SDK Beta v1.0 releases](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework-and-backend-sdk-beta-v1-0-are-live-7348c0725a12) for the Showrunners SDK & Backend SDKs with example dApps for you developers to test us out!\\n\\nQ3 saw MAJOR leaps and changes in how EPNS is designed and progressed as a protocol. It was time that EPNS looked to be future-proof and ready for a multi-chain world. The EPNS Protocol was now divided into EPNS Core Protocol and EPNS Communicator Protocol. The Core protocol is deployed only on Ethereum while the Communicator Protocol would be deployed on multiple chains, allowing for multi-chain functionality. Going multi-chain also meant that we needed to change how user incentives were designed, the details of which you can [read here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/roadmap-q3-audited-epns-push-protocol-v1-is-here-f4560dfe550c).\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe id=\\"player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" title=\\"Breakpoint 2021: Surf\'s Up: Demos from the Solana Ecosystem (Day 2)\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\" }}  src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eY9uxsJtfYQ?wmode=opaque&amp;start=9&amp;widget_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fpush-protocol%2Four-2021-year-in-review-8193ddbab4d8&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com&amp;widgetid=1\\"></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\nQ3 also included the official [launch of EPNS Governance](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-governance-goes-live-lets-push-for-progressive-decentralized-governance-7448b58b89b4), marking the first step to progressively decentralizing the EPNS Protocol among $PUSH holders.\\n\\nFurther, the Protocol contracts were also audited by [Chainsafe](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1452640272475574277?s=20) during this Q3!\\n\\nWe were also able to achieve the launch of the alpha of [PUSH Nodes](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-nodes-p2p-web3s-way-to-communicate-6a473577d173) which would enable communication across Ethereum, L2s, and even other EVM and non-EVM L1s!\\n\\nIt was in the same quarter that we also started working on EPIPs (Ethereum Push Improvement Proposals) as a means to allow users to propose changes to and vote on proposals related to EPNS.\\n\\nAs the year started coming to a close in Q4, our complete focus shifted on preparing EPNS for its upcoming Mainnet launch in early January 2022.\\n\\nThis quarter saw us adding some much needed protocol feature updates such as a spam box for indirect subscriptions, delegation of channel controls, and verification badges on frontend. Along with this came our successful implementation of meta transactions for \u201csubscribe/unsubscribe\u201d actions, as well as for sending notifications themselves! This represents a huge step forward in terms of user experience as users wanting to opt-in to receive notifications will now just need to sign an off-chain transaction.\\n\\nThe staging environment, PUSH Mobile App and PUSH Nodes were migrated to Kovan Testnet, allowing us to ensure that our migration scripts are rock solid, and assuring us that we were taking all the necessary precautions in our preparation for the big day!\\n\\n2021 was a busy year, and we\u2019re proud to have achieved the vast majority of our product and community milestones. To always remain transparent, it\u2019s important to note that the third party mobile SDK, P2P Push Nodes incentives, and Ceramic DID integration milestones were postponed so we could prioritize making EPNS multi-chain compatible ahead of mainnet launch. In our upcoming 2022 Roadmap, we are brainstorming the best implementation cycle for these features.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f Rocking the world with EPNS Rockstars \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\n- NFTs and Rockstars\\n- Community contributions: from beautiful artwork, development guides, articles and more!\\n  At EPNS, we realized that we are nothing without the backing of our wonderful community. In order to show our gratitude to our most passionate and vibrant supporters, we launched the EPNS ROCKSTARS NFT Collection. Every week, a member from the community is chosen (currently via [Governance](https://gov.epns.io/)) to be awarded that week\u2019s ROCKSTAR NFT and by extension be crowned as that week\u2019s EPNS Rockstar! And that\u2019s not all, every ROCKSTAR receives a bag of 2400 $PUSH along with their prestigious NFT!\\n\\nOver the course of this year we have chosen 35 EPNS Rockstars, and we are at a loss for words for the sheer dedication, love, and support this community has shown us while participating in this program!\\n\\n![Second Image of Our 2021 Year in Review \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nFrom community education through articles, development guides, and simple explainers, to EPNS-themed artworks, memes, and videos; this community showed us that they really are our Rockstars!\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f Power to the People \u2014 Governance Launch \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\n<img alt=\\"\\" class=\\"bg kq lw c\\" width=\\"700\\" height=\\"394\\" loading=\\"eager\\" role=\\"presentation\\" src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*S2xhUAhgf5IrLEDG\\" ></img>\\n\\nIn September, we launched EPNS Governance, as a push for progressive decentralization of the EPNS protocol among the community. It was time for the $PUSH community to take charge by delegating their votes! The Governance framework launched with three ways for the community to vote and be involved: 1) Weekly Rockstar NFT, 2) Grants Program and 3) Metagovernance.\\n\\nThe Governance framework laid out the rules, processes, and roles of governance by the community during Phase 0 of the progressive decentralization plan for EPNS. This ensured that there was a clear groundwork for the community to coordinate to make better decisions. In the first iteration of the governance mechanism we use Snapshot, a multi-chain gasless client for decentralized voting. Due to its Snapshot-based implementation, the voting mechanism shall be weighted based on the number of $PUSH tokens delegated to the voting address. Hereafter, any potential modifications to the protocol must pass through a proposal and voting process.\\n\\nOver the past few months, we saw a steady increase in the number of participants and delegates in governance. The governance forum has been gaining traction to propose and discuss proposals. The increasing involvement of community members within the forum\u2019s General Discussion, and also during the Snapshot voting of the weekly EPNS Rockstar has helped us slowly achieve the progressive decentralization we aimed for when we launched the EPNS Governance.\\n\\nLearn more about how EPNS Governance works [here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-governance-goes-live-lets-push-for-progressive-decentralized-governance-7448b58b89b4).\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf1f Giving Back through Retroactive Public Goods Funding \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nWhat started as a small but ambitious project in Gitcoin Grants Round 7 ended up as a top 5 project in the round with 210 contributors, and has grown today to be a sponsor for the past two Grants Rounds this year!\\n\\nSo, now, with all the love and support we\u2019ve been receiving from you amazing folks in our community. it was time for us to give back to the Web3 community by sponsoring Gitcoin Grants Rounds 11, & 12!\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1471163142960934912&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"790\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"EPNS | $PUSH - We\'re hiring! on Twitter: &quot;EPNS is sponsoring @gitcoin Grants Round 12 - GR12 \ud83d\udcabStarted as a Grantee, &amp; now here we are as a Grantor \u23e9As we look back, we\'re incredibly excited to help early projects the same way we were helped back in our early days \u2728A glimpse into GR12 \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/3PHO64kvIM / Twitter&quot;\\" class=\\"eh n ei tm bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\n\\n<div class=\\"ab ca\\"><div class=\\"ch bg dx dy dz ea\\"><h2 id=\\"4ba4\\" class=\\"nd ne ev be nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn mi no np nq mm nr ns nt mq nu nv nw nx bj\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\"\\">\ud83c\udf1f Conferences, Talks, AMAs\u2026Events Galore!!! \ud83c\udf1f</h2><p id=\\"5580\\" class=\\"pw-post-body-paragraph lx ly ev lz b ma ny mc md me nz mg mh mi oa mk ml mm ob mo mp mq oc ms mt mu eo bj\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\"\\">2021 had no shortage of events within the crypto and web3 community.

The past year was an inspiring one with EPNS accomplishing and expanding beyond imagination. We worked hard to ensure EPNS is cross-chain ready! And we even had the opportunity to put a POC ready during the Solana Breakpoint event! We expanded our team and integrated with multiple major protocols and projects within the ecosystem, and continue to have the backing of the most amazing community we\u2019ve seen!\\n\\n2022 marks a new beginning, it\u2019s now time for EPNS to go big. We have big plans for the upcoming year \u2014 Mainnet launch, grants program and more!\\n\\nThe EPNS mainnet launches on January 11, 2022. With it, applications across Web3 will begin exploring what it means to communicate with each other and with their users in a decentralized, permissionless, and incentivized way.\\n\\nWith the launch of our mainnet, businesses, service providers, and dApps in Web3 will officially be able to create channels to communicate with their own communities. The utilities are nearly limitless. DeFi applications can set up notifications that are triggered with on-chain information like loan liquidations and governance proposals. Good samaritans can set up channels to notify their subscribers about airdrops, or when suspicious activity could portent security issues.

This new industry is now home to a plethora of dApps, decentralized protocols, businesses, and rapid technological developments. But despite such momentous success, user participation and engagement rates in DeFi are still at the lower end.\\n\\nDeFi protocols have managed to garner significant attention from users but they lack the mechanism that keeps users coming back to the protocol to engage with it. EPNS has been working towards building this mechanism ever since its inception and decentralized push notifications are now a part of DeFi.\\n\\nHere\u2019s taking a quick look at why the DeFi industry is in dire need of a communication layer and how users and protocols can use EPNS to interact within the DeFi space.\\n\\n# The Need for EPNS\\n\\nAs a part of one of the most rapidly evolving industries in the world, users of DeFi have to keep up with quite a lot of things. The ever-changing token prices, constantly updating protocols, new product launches, and investment opportunities to name a few.\\n\\nBut because of the lack of reliable means of communication within DeFi, users are required to manually go about finding this information and keeping themselves updated. This is quite a hectic task especially since most of us are spoiled by push notifications delivering this information to us in the Web2 space. Some of the critical communication that needs to happen are:\\n\\n- Near Liquidation Alert (Borrowers & Liquidators)\\n- Staking Rewards Available to Claim (Stakers)\\n- Staking Rewards About to Expire (Stakers)\\n- Price Alerts (Traders)\\n- Stablecoin Peg Slippage (Arbitragers)\\n- Low Gas Cost (Devs, ETH Power Users)\\n- Rebalances (Token Set Users)\\n- Index Selection/Weighting Changes (Index Users)\\n- Token/Contract Migrations (Protocol Users)\\n- Governance Updates, Token Launches\\n- New Collateral Types on Money Markets\\n- New Liquidity Mining Incentives\\n- Yield Farming APY alerts\\n- Escrow Periods Ending / Tokens Coming Unlocked\\n\\nThe possibilities are endless and one of the main goals of EPNS is to reduce this communication gap in DeFi and help retain the good user experience Web2 has established. Let\u2019s look at a subset of above use cases and how they bring the UX on par with Web2.0 with EPNS.\\n\\n# Loan Liquidations\\n\\nOn DeFi lending platforms, borrowers are at risk of liquidation of collateral if the price of the collateralized asset falls below a certain threshold. The lack of a reliable communication channel means that borrowers have to manually keep track of the price fluctuations and more often than not, liquidation occurs unexpectedly. So, by integrating EPNS into their protocol, lending protocols can promptly inform users when their collateral nears liquidation. Along with this, they can also get notified when their loan approaches the end of term.\\n\\n# Governance Updates\\n\\nGovernance is another aspect where EPNS can prove to be invaluable. To ensure proper decentralization, DeFi protocols require all community members to participate in the governance process. But most users miss out on this simply because they aren\u2019t aware of the new governance proposals that have been created. By incorporating EPNS, DeFi protocols would be able to inform their users whenever new governance proposals are created and voting begins. The result of the voting and the dates of implementation of new updates can also be informed to the community members with ease.\\n\\nAdditionally, stakers can be informed when the rewards are available to claim or about to expire.\\n\\n# Token Launches and Pricing\\n\\nWith the number of traders and investors in DeFi growing exponentially, the need for a mechanism that keeps them updated about the various opportunities is quite evident. In this regard, the integration of EPNS into decentralized exchanges and trading platforms could be a welcome windfall. Through EPNS, investors and traders can get notified whenever there are new token launches or when the prices of assets fluctuate.\\n\\nArbitrageurs in DeFi can also hugely benefit from EPNS, getting notified every time there are pricing differences in the market that they can profit from. Stablecoin peg slippage for instance.\\n\\n# Farm Launches and Updates\\n\\nNot just trading and investing but yield farming in DeFi has become quite popular in the past couple of years. Here too, the integration of EPNS can have a significant impact.. Every time a new farming opportunity emerges, investors can promptly get notified about the same. Along with this, escrow ending, APY alerts, and new mining incentives can create an overall better farming experience for users.\\n\\n# Layer-2 Updates\\n\\nOf course, L2 protocols are also poised to benefit from a communication layer built for DeFi. The protocols can keep users updated about things like governance updates, low gas costs periods, deployment on other chains, and contract migrations.\\n\\n# General Updates\\n\\nLastly, NFT marketplaces, Metaverse projects, and GameFi protocols could also use EPNS Gaming projects could send out notifications every time a new battle starts, or when users have successfully completed missions. This ensures that user participation and engagement is retained at all times and improve the user-experiences\\n\\nLong story short, EPNS makes it possible for the DeFi industry to have a communication layer that reduces friction and drives user participation.\\n\\n# Upholding Decentralization\\n\\nUsers are the center of all operations in the DeFi space. In fact, the very purpose of DeFi is to give power back into the hands of users. While this sounds very impressive, the implementation of true decentralization has been a challenge in DeFi. This is because of the lack of a communications layer. Users are still kept in the dark about various happenings in the DeFi space until they check manually. This causes them to miss out on several investment and governance opportunities, reducing user participation and threatening decentralization.\\n\\nHowever, EPNS ensures that DeFi\u2019s core principles of decentralization are upheld by constantly keeping users informed. In doing so, it creates a level of trust and transparency within the industry and improves their user experience significantly.\\n\\nStay in touch!

Fundamental to the success and engagement of Web2 is a ubiquitous communication network that keeps bringing users _back_ to the web, over and over again. One of the most revolutionary digital communication techniques of the last 20 years has been the trusty push notification. By keeping users constantly updated about various happenings on the internet, this notification tool has shaped the way users and applications interact with each other on the web.\\n\\nWith the rise of blockchain technology, an ecosystem of decentralized applications have exploded, offering new tools to developers, investors, creators, and more. Like the early days of the internet, however, this nascent landscape has no means of internal communication, and instead has been reliant entirely on legacy centralized platforms.\\n\\nThis has created unnecessary friction between users and protocols, leading to non-deal user experience and lower engagement rates. This is why EPNS has been building the ultimate communication layer for Web3. Now, with the launch of the EPNS mainnet, push notifications and on-chain communication will officially become a fundamental link in the mesh of Web3.\\n\\nHere\u2019s taking a quick look at how EPNS is poised to change the communication game in Web3.\\n\\n### Building the Web3 Communication Layer\\n\\nFor a better understanding of what EPNS does, it is critical to recall how EPNS works. The EPNS ecosystem consists of three main players \u2014 **users, channels, and subscribers.**\\n\\nEveryone using EPNS in any possible way is considered a _user_ of the platform, split between _providers_ and _consumers._ Service providers can register themselves as _channels_ and send notifications, whereas consumers can subscribe to those channels to receive notifications (thus becoming _subscribers_). Furthermore, a channel itself can subscribe to other channels to receive their notifications. \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nWith the launch of our mainnet, businesses, service providers, and dApps in Web3 will officially be able to create channels to communicate with their own communities. The best part? The utilities are nearly limitless. DeFi applications can set up notifications that are triggered with on-chain information like loan liquidations and governance proposals. Good samaritans can set up channels to notify their subscribers about airdrops, or when suspicious activity could portent security issues. Centralized exchanges can notify people when new tokens are launched. All of this happens with just a click of a button, putting so much more power into the hands of the everyday Web3 user.\\n\\nSince the EPNS token generation event in Spring 2021, we have partnered with dozens of DeFi, gaming, NFT, and infrastructure projects to build channel and notification prototypes with them. Many of these will be immediately available at mainnet launch.\\n\\n# Becoming Blockchain Agnostic\\n\\nAs our name suggests, our initial focus was to enable this communication network for Ethereum. Once we succeeded in building that technology, we updated our goal to become the _default communication layer for all of Web3._ We now have a solution to be blockchain-agnostic, meaning businesses across any L1 or L2 will be able to effectively communicate and collaborate through EPNS.\\n\\n> **To achieve this, we divided our protocol into two different smart contracts \u2014 EPNS Core and EPNS Communicator.**\\n\\nThe EPNS Core smart contract deals with most of the heavy lifting, including channel creation, governance, and incentive mechanisms. The EPNS Core smart contract will remain on the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nThe EPNS Communicator enables multi-chain communication. It can be deployed on any blockchain network that wants to integrate push notifications. This smart contract is responsible for actually sending out notifications and handling channel subscriptions. The operations of both these smart contracts are overseen by a system of PUSH Nodes that are central to our architecture.\\n\\nPUSH Nodes track the events and smart contracts of different protocols across blockchain networks. Based on these events, they dispatch relevant notifications from the correct service provider to its corresponding subscribers without fail. What these nodes do is map the blockchain address of every subscriber with all the channels they have subscribed to and then deliver notifications as and when they\u2019re triggered by an event at the service provider\u2019s end. They\u2019re also capable of deconstructing and synchronizing payloads (notifications) sent from a channel in the database.\\n\\nTo learn more about Core, Communicator, and Nodes \u2014 [see here.](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-nodes-p2p-web3s-way-to-communicate-6a473577d173)\\n\\n# For the New-Age Internet\\n\\nPush notifications played a vital role in the success of businesses across industries in Web2. Now, by bringing a similar service in the Web3 space, EPNS will ensure it can fast pace the growth of the new age internet services, becoming an integral part of its operations."},{"id":"epns-sponsoring-gitcoin-grants-12","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-sponsoring-gitcoin-grants-12","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-15-epns-sponsoring-gitcoin-grants/index.md","title":"EPNS sponsoring Gitcoin Grants Round 12!","description":"EPNS sponsoring Gitcoin Grants Round 12!","date":"2021-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 15, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Gitcoin","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/gitcoin"},{"label":"Open Source","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"}],"readingTime":1.3466666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-sponsoring-gitcoin-grants-12","title":"EPNS sponsoring Gitcoin Grants Round 12!","description":"EPNS sponsoring Gitcoin Grants Round 12!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"EPNS is excited to announce that we are sponsoring $50K to yet another Gitcoin Grants Round, the GR12, in order to support and facilitate the growth of digital public goods.","tags":["Gitcoin","Open Source","Web3","Ethereum"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Web3\u2019s Ultimate Communication Layer is Around the Corner","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/web3-ultimate-communication-layer"},"nextItem":{"title":"EPNS Collaborates With Symphony Finance To Facilitate Push Notifications for Limit Order","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-collaborates-with-symphony-finance"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover image of EPNS sponsoring Gitcoin Grants Round 12!](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\x3c!-- > Gitcoin Grants Round 12 ends December 16th! --\x3e\\n\\nEPNS is excited to announce that **we are sponsoring $50K to yet another Gitcoin Grants Round, the GR12,** in order to support and facilitate the growth of digital public goods.\\n\\nHow it started \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1311723039348858881&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"281\\" width=\\"500\\" title=\\"EPNS | $PUSH - We\'re hiring! on Twitter: &quot;\ud83e\udd41 Last 24 hrs left !!Thanks to all the amazing people who donated to our @gitcoin grant and all our well wishers \ud83d\ude4fWe love you all and are humbled and pumped by the response and community support \ud83e\udd17 \ud83d\udc93https://t.co/Ia465RDt7P pic.twitter.com/XdYh0LkisG / Twitter&quot;\\" class=\\"eo n ff dy bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\n\\nHow it\u2019s going \ud83e\uddf5\\n\\n[Link](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1435620157800419329?s=20)\\n\\nThe bond between EPNS and Gitcoin has been ever-growing since its inception in Gitcoin KERNEL, where EPNS was incubated and molded in our early days.

Our existing collab with Gitcoin, which was [announced earlier this year](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/gitcoin-growing-open-source-using-web3-notifs-36a9ec6e97dc), focuses on the EPNS platform to deliver notifications during the grants process, which would help in connecting grantees and grantors.\\n\\nOur story from grantee to grantors \u2764\\n\\nMoreover, the Gitcoin community has also supported EPNS immensely in the past, notably back in Grants Round 7 where EPNS was one among the top 5 projects during the round with over 210 contributors!

It was wholesome and we are truly grateful to everyone who backed and supported us.\\n\\nSince then, EPNS has grown immensely with a successful seed round and collaboration with not only Gitcoin but many major Web3 protocols in the space today. Using the platform set up by this wonderful community, we were able to take the opportunity to give back to them by successfully sponsoring Gitcoin\u2019s Grants Round 11 (GR11) and now the opportunity to sponsor Grant\u2019s Round 12 (GR12)!\\n\\nWe are incredibly excited to help early projects looking for community support just like we were once during our early days.\\n\\nWe believe in the future of an open, free, and public web3.0 and are glad to be able to play part in supporting others who are building towards the same goal.\\n\\n[Fund a grant today](https://gitcoin.co/grants/explorer?page=1&limit=12&me=false&sort_option=weighted_shuffle&collection_id=false&network=mainnet&state=active&profile=false&sub_round_slug=false&collections_page=1&grant_regions=&grant_types=&grant_tags=&tenants=&idle=false&featured=true&round_type=false&tab=grants) \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf31"},{"id":"epns-collaborates-with-symphony-finance","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-collaborates-with-symphony-finance","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-14-epns-collaborates-with-symphony-finance/index.md","title":"EPNS Collaborates With Symphony Finance To Facilitate Push Notifications for Limit Order","description":"EPNS Collaborates With Symphony Finance To Facilitate Push Notifications for Limit Order","date":"2021-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 14, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Collaboration","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/collaboration"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Symphony","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/symphony"}],"readingTime":1.7033333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-collaborates-with-symphony-finance","title":"EPNS Collaborates With Symphony Finance To Facilitate Push Notifications for Limit Order","description":"EPNS Collaborates With Symphony Finance To Facilitate Push Notifications for Limit Order","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Post its illustrious summer of 2020, DeFi established itself as one of the major industries of the world.

The sheer number of opportunities now available in DeFi, for investors, entrepreneurs, and arbitrageurs are mind-boggling. DeFi\u2019s trusty yield farming and staking are still working wonders bringing an influx of new users into DeFi every day.\\n\\nAlong with this, cryptocurrency-based derivatives have also been picking up steam recently. Options and futures are now among the most popular financial products on crypto exchanges. Now, even limit orders are being introduced to DeFi with the emergent Symphony Finance and we\u2019re pleased to be working with the protocol in their journey of becoming DeFi\u2019s go-to trading protocol.\\n\\n### How Symphony Finance Can Benefit from EPNS\\n\\nSymphony Finance has built one of DeFi\u2019s first yield optimized limit protocols called \u201cYOLO\u201d. It aims to maximize the total returns users can reap by combining limit orders with yield farming. For the uninitiated, limit orders are financial products that allow the owner to set their own limit price to either buy or sell an asset. If the limit price is reached, the order is executed.\\n\\nIn this context, Symphony Finance\u2019s YOLO allows users to create limit orders for digital assets by depositing the sold asset. The asset is then deposited by the protocol on yield farming protocols like AAVE, Mstable, and Yearn. This way, the underlying asset generates yield continuously for the user. If the limit price is reached the limit order is automatically executed and the user receives the asset along with all the generated yield.\\n\\nApart from yield generation YOLO has other great features like \u201cLiquidity Aggregation\u201d, which benefits the users by filling their limit orders at the best price. YOLO also guarantees the orders get executed once the prices are there in the market by eliminating the need for \u201cTakers\u201d. In the context of YOLO, the integrated DEXes act as Takers. Stop loss is another feature that YOLO provides although this feature is not available in many orderbook DEXes in DeFi today.\\n\\nFor all these processes in Symphony Finance to run smoothly, the protocol needs a means of direct communication with its users, and what better than EPNS to make this happen.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our collaboration with Symphony Finance, we aim to facilitate decentralized push notifications for investors, traders, and users of the protocol. These decentralized notifications can become a reliable means for the protocol to communicate with its users.\\n\\nUsers can subscribe to the official Symphony Finance channel on the EPNS and opt to receive notifications. Whenever the users\u2019 orders are executed on Symphony, users are immediately intimated. This eliminates the need for them to manually check on their limit order status, reducing friction between the protocol and users.\\n\\nAs Symphony Finance strives to create futuristic financial products for DeFi users, we\u2019re pleased to join them on this journey and hope to become an integral part of their operations."},{"id":"behold-the-metaverse","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/behold-the-metaverse","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-08-behold-the-metaverse/index.md","title":"Behold the Metaverse!

It brings about a new era, a new frontier \u2014 \u201cthe next big thing\u201d of the digital revolution of the internet that we all are part of for the past 20\u201330 years.\\n\\nSo what\u2019s so exciting about this so-called Metaverse? In fact, what is it even? Let\u2019s dive deep into this rabbit hole of endless possibilities and learn more about what all this hype is all about.\\n\\n## **What is the Metaverse?**\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve seen movies like \u201cReady Player One\u201d, you must already be able to grasp what a Metaverse means. A Metaverse is not a specific game or an application; it is a virtual space that could possibly combine virtual reality, augmented reality, the internet, and of course crypto. The Metaverse is one of the most obvious \u201cnext steps\u201d in the evolution of social technological advancements and immersion we have as a human species. As we moved from local/regional gatherings to instant messaging and group chats, to now group video calls and meetings. Being \u201conline\u201d is now so common for us that life before it seems impossible or at least an inconvenience.\\n\\nOne could say that a metaverse is a new form of digital nation-state, which is powered by cryptoeconomic systems which potentially has a single source of truth.\\n\\n## **A Realm of Infinite Possibilities**\\n\\nWith the help of blockchain and Web3, we are able to create digital worlds that have cryptographically proven digital scarcity, interoperability, programmability, and permissionless innovation.\\n\\nImagine the day when you can experience the heat of the Sahara, and the wilderness of the Amazon rainforest, and experience what it feels like to be in space, all the while chatting with your friends, and while being in the comfort of your home?  \\nImagine being able to teleport virtually to any place you want to, showing off your digital space, and experiencing things in a way that you never could in the physical world. This is what the Metaverse allows you to do.  \\nIt blurs the lines between what it means to be virtual and to be in reality. Eventually, we all will move towards a digital life that intermingles with our physical life, and although it may sound crazy, what do our lives look like now? Most of us spend most of our time on the internet (and if you\u2019re a CT degen you\u2019re probably here 24/7 \ud83d\ude09).\\n\\nWhile no one is completely sure what the Metaverse is going to look like. There seems to be a general consensus about what people expect it to be \u2014 shared virtual spaces where anyone can hang out, socialize, work, play, or live, without the limitations of geographical or physical limitations. These worlds will have their own functional economies. Creators and influencers will make it more engaging just like the social media we have today. Digital identities and virtual assets will become a thing (well, it already is), and hopefully, a shared, open-sourced system, will be behind the scenes (such as Ethereum). NFTs and digital lands, and other assets, are no longer argued to be just speculative items, but something that is required to build these digital creator economies from the ground up.\\n\\nEven Facebook, recently changed its name to [Meta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gElfIo6uw4g) to signal its focus in working on building a Metaverse, although it would most probably be a closed-source one. Meta wants to bring everyone to their digital space, whereas Web3 is also working towards the same goal but using open and shared systems and in a privacy-centric way. It\u2019s almost like a race to the finish, one that remains to be seen on who will win.\\n\\n## **EPNS brings decentralized communication to a decentralized metaverse**\\n\\nAs Web3 brings about the Metaverse in a decentralized way, an issue of communication between users and protocols is posed. EPNS will play a key role in acting as the communication layer for the Web3 as the Metaverse is built in the coming years. DeFi in the Metaverse is what will connect different shared spaces to transfer value across each other, in the same way, for these protocols in the Metaverse to communicate with users, EPNS will act as the channel for it to happen.\\n\\nImagine a scenario where your virtual land in Decentraland is up for auction and when visitors bid for your land you get instantly notified about the latest bid via EPNS. Similarly, planning and communicating with your friends while visiting virtual art galleries like those replicated by Sotheby\u2019s will be a reality in the future.\\n\\nEPNS is more than just a decentralized notification system, it is a way for services, smart contracts, protocols, etc. to communicate with their users. As the Metaverse expands, so will EPNS and its importance in the digital world. Communication has been one of the biggest barriers to user experience that prevents users from mass adoption.\\n\\n> Also, we recently also spoke about Metaverse and the possibilities around it on [A Show about crypto](https://indian-podcasts.com/podcast/a-show-about-crypto-with-rohan-joshi/what-is-the-metaverse-feat-harsh-rajat) podcast featuring Harsh Rajat, EPNS founder.\\n\\nWith the scaling solutions being adopted day by day and the communication layer established by EPNS for the Metaverse and Ethereum as a whole, Web3 is primed for real mass adoption among the global population."},{"id":"epns-monthly-blocks-nov-2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-monthly-blocks-nov-2021","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-01-epns-monthly-blocks-nov-2021/index.md","title":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","description":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","date":"2021-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Mainnet","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/mainnet"}],"readingTime":3.27,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-monthly-blocks-nov-2021","title":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","description":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We started the month strong with the big announcement of the successful Audit of the EPNS Push Protocol V1!\ud83d\udca5.

Let\u2019s get started \ud83d\udcaa \ud83d\udd14\\n\\n### EPNS Protocol Overview / Recap\\n\\nWe recently released an article with an [overview of the entire EPNS Protocol](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/roadmap-q3-audited-epns-push-protocol-v1-is-here-f4560dfe550c). To summarize, the EPNS Protocol is a group of smart contracts that enables 1) validation and governance through EPNS Core and 2) communication through EPNS Communicator smart contracts and SDKs.\\n\\nUnderstanding the two components of the EPNS Protocol is critical, as Push Nodes interact with them to enable decentralized communication \u2014 aka the missing piece of Web3. We will briefly describe them below, but recommend reading [the full article](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/roadmap-q3-audited-epns-push-protocol-v1-is-here-f4560dfe550c).\\n\\n#### EPNS Core (Governance Smart Contract)\\n\\nBefore anyone can send a notification, they must first be activated on EPNS Core as a channel. It is important to note that the EPNS Core resides only on the Ethereum blockchain. EPNS Core handles a majority of governance and channel related task including:\\n\\n- Channel Creation\\n- Channel Modification\\n- Channel Blocking / Deletion\\n- Verified Channels\\n- Fees Management among token holders, etc\\n\\n#### EPNS Communicator\\n\\nEPNS Communicator, as the name suggests, is the layer where actual communication happens. The Communicator Protocol is comparatively much simpler & handles tasks including:\\n\\n- Opt-in for notifications\\n- Sending Notifs\\n- Delegating responsibilities of Notifs to other wallets\\n- Verifying multichain channel creation, etc\\n\\n<blockquote><i>Note: the EPNS Communicator resides on multiple blockchains, both EVM and non-EVM compatible. In addition to being available as smart contracts, the EPNS Communicator SDK enables sending notification payloads directly to Push Nodes as well as enabling off-chain transactions.</i></blockquote>\\n\\nThe EPNS Communicator ensures that on-chain and off-chain notifications alike can make it to your wallet address regardless of what a services chooses to send them from. In other words, notifications make it to you whether they come from the logic of a smart contract, dapp, or backend.\\n\\nWith the brief intro out of the way, it\u2019s time to dive deep into Push Nodes and how they make everything possible \u2764\ufe0f!\\n\\n### Push Nodes Overview\\n\\nMultichain, huh! So if the contracts are deployed on multiple chains and governance happens on Ethereum how does everything work together \ud83e\udd14! Well Frens, the answer to that lies in Push Nodes!!!\\n\\n![First Image of Push Nodes P2P \u2014 Web3\u2019s way to communicate!](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nPush Nodes are the central piece of the network that enables the blockchain of Web3 notifications to work. In essence, they are validators that can be run by anyone in the future with staking and slashing. Push Nodes have three crucial tasks:\\n\\n- <b>Listening</b>: Push Nodes listens to EPNS Communicator smart contracts on every blockchain. Besides that, they also enable off-chain or direct communication via API calls either from a backend or a dApp. This on-chain and off-chain communication listening enables EPNS to support just about any Web3 service\u2026 ie: smart contracts, dApps, backends or direct payloads!!\\n- <b>Validating and Governing</b>: The communication which is driven by the EPNS Communicator layers require validation (Checking if the channel exists, is not spamming, is cross-chain verified, etc) which happens via the EPNS Core layer which contains functions to enable governance and to verify the existence of the channel.\\n- <b>Admitting to Network / Dispatching</b>: Lastly, the Push Nodes admit these notifications that are tied to wallet address in the network which can then be tapped into by any crypto frontend / wallet to display them. The dispatch functionality is also present in these nodes to allow bridging of Web3 notifications to be displayed in Web2 apps in case the wallet / frontend / software wants to enable that instead of handling direct socket connection.\\n\\n<blockquote><i>Push Nodes along with the functionality outlined above are already working in a test environment. We plan to decentralize push nodes after mainnet.</i></blockquote>\\n\\n#### Push Nodes Architecture Deep Dive\\n\\n![Second Image of Push Nodes P2P \u2014 Web3\u2019s way to communicate!](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nLet\u2019s briefly look at some of the key functionalities of the Push Nodes and how the multichain construction of payload and dispatching works.\\n\\n#### History Fetcher (Syncing / Indexing)\\n\\nSyncing the previous history of EPNS Core and EPNS Communicator is one of the crucial feature of this module. It ensures replication of data which is one of the core feature of push nodes apart from ensuring quick validation as it indexes EPNS Core data including channels.\\n\\n#### Web Sockets (Receiving)\\n\\nThe main job of Push Nodes is to enable wss sockets on both the receiving side, ie: EPNS Comm smart contracts (on-chain) and direct payloads coming from backend / dapp (off-chain) side as a way to listen and update the state of the persistent data storage. The web socket connection and the router that enables routes ensures this functionality.\\n\\n#### Validation and Admittance (Validators)\\n\\nThe received payloads whether direct or from EPNS Communicator smart contracts always trigger multiple validation phases which are outlined below:\\n\\n- Validating Payload Authenticity: The push nodes check any incoming payload for the channel address (or delegator address) to ensure that the payloads are authentic and will drop any payloads that doesn\u2019t fit the scenario.\\n- Extrapolating payload and recipients: The next step which happens is the extrapolation of data that fetches the actual payload from the identity following which will include looking at where the payload is stored (at the time of writing, supports IPFS and smart contract bytes), expanding on the recipient list (entire channel, subset or single), etc to get the list of recipients as well as the actual payload.\\n- Mapping to recipients inbox / spambox: The next step in the validation requires mapping these payloads of individual recipients to either their inbox or spambox based on the users opt-in that has already been recorded either via the history fetcher or via the EPNS Comm smart contracts or via direct opt-in on the push nodes itself.\\n\\n#### Dispatching via Web Sockets (Dispatching)\\n\\nOn the opposite side, the web sockets connection ensures that any crypto frontend / wallet can listen directly to the push nodes and use it to display the notifications / communications meant for the user wallet address.\\n\\n#### Dispatching via Web3 to Web2 bridge (Dispatching)\\n\\nAn optional functionality that runs locally and will not be synced across push nodes is the ability to transmit these notifications from Web3 to Web2 apps / extensions. For example: sending the notifications to a mobile app on iOS / Android.\\n\\nThe way this bridge works is having a local functionality of mapping wallets addresses to device ids of a particular third party app along with the centralized credentials of the app push certificates. If this module is active then that push node not only syncs and validates the data but is also responsible for pushing the notifications out to web2 apps or extension.\\n\\n#### Road Forward\\n\\nAll these features and other crucial data outlined above are present and working which is how you guys are getting the web3 notifications we all wanted \ud83d\ude03 (though running in a controlled environment).\\n\\nIn brief, the plan from here is to create a cluster of nodes that will communicate with each other and keep the data in sync and create decentralization around this layer as well.\\n\\n<blockquote><i>\\nWe will be creating a rewards (via staking) and penalizing (via slashing) game theory around it which will ensure active participation and true decentralization of these nodes as we move further into syncing and readying our push nodes to be open for users to freely run on.\\n</i></blockquote>"},{"id":"fabwelt-partners-with-epns","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/fabwelt-partners-with-epns","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-18-fabwelt-partners-with-epns/index.md","title":"Fabwelt partners with EPNS to bring push notifications to crypto gaming","description":"Fabwelt partners with EPNS to bring push notifications to crypto gaming","date":"2021-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 18, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Gaming","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/gaming"},{"label":"Nft","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/nft"},{"label":"Collaboration","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/collaboration"}],"readingTime":1.5066666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"fabwelt-partners-with-epns","title":"Fabwelt partners with EPNS to bring push notifications to crypto gaming","description":"Fabwelt partners with EPNS to bring push notifications to crypto gaming","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"The growing mainstream adoption for NFTs and its potential has made the crypto-world go crazy.

IoTeX has built a privacy-centric and scalable IoT blockchain network running on the fastest and most secure blockchain architecture to create a decentralized trusted fabric for IoT. EPNS is pleased to announce the launch of a pilot program to provide decentralized push notifications to the users of the IoTeX blockchain to help them more deeply integrate IoT blockchain solutions into their business.\\n\\n### **IoTeX and EPNS Partner to Power IoT Blockchains**\\n\\nKnown as the Internet of Trusted Things, IoTeX has built a truly business-ready blockchain. Enterprises do not have to spend large amounts of time and money to seamlessly connect their physical and digital worlds and improve operational efficiencies. Built-in services include asset tracking and supply chain management with Pebble Tracker, video cameras to manage data ownership and control, and multi-stakeholder collaboration of trusted data.\\n\\nThe IoTeX blockchain powers real devices, allowing for real world use cases in supply chain management, healthcare, DeFi, and other industries. Currently, 6,666 devices are connected to the blockchain. Devices include the first blockchain-powered home security camera Ucam and the multi-sensor IoT data oracle Pebble, which converts real world phenomenon into blockchain-ready data. This is made possible by the IoTeX network of hierarchically arranged blockchains and subchains, allowing for the concurrent running of many interoperable blockchains.\\n\\nThe blockchain IoT market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 45.1 percent to 2.4 billion USD between 2020 to 2026 as enterprises migrate to IoT blockchains for increased operational efficiency and security. As the blockchain IoT platform streamlines and decentralizes complex networks of devices, all stakeholders in the network will be highly dependent on notifications to optimize operations. These users rely on notification services to deliver important information, including:\\n\\n- Customizable notifications based on user-defined thresholds for streaming data from Pebble Tracker, which captures real world data and sends it to IoTeX smart contracts.\\n- Daily notifications of rewards received from the IoTeX staking ecosystem (>10k unique stakers).\\n- Notifs any time a proposal starts/ends as part of the decentralized governance via snapshot (http://gov.iotex.io/) initiative.\\n\\nUnfortunately, IoTeX users are currently reliant on email, Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels to receive alerts. A push notification service would allow all platform users to receive and take timely action on data while still protecting data privacy as smart contract users interact with internal and external data sources.\\n\\n# **The EPNS Solution**\\n\\nThe EPNS decentralized push notification service sends timely notifications through a single source of communication, the investor\u2019s wallet. All notifications go directly to the user\u2019s wallet where they can take immediate action. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet. The partnership benefits to IoTeX users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all data notifications directly to IoTeX user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and IoTeX teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the various push notification needs of DeFi data users and markets.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different data notification requirements.\\n\\n# **How EPNS Will Support IoTeX and IoT Blockchains**\\n\\nUnder this pilot program, EPNS is building a dedicated channel for IoTeX (see the [EPNS litepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io) for definitions of channels, services, and more). IoTeX users can subscribe to the IoTeX channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets. Through collaboration with the IoTeX team, we will gain insight into the push notification needs of users of IOT blockchain services and what they want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nDecentralized notifications will allow enterprises to actively respond to real world data interactions with IoT devices and smart contracts, receive notifications of IoTeX staking rewards, and reply in a timely manner to governance notifs. Meanwhile, all users can continue to operate within the private, secure ecosystem of IoTeX across different chains, without having to deal with integration pains across many different device and data services. Likewise, all push notifications will now be integrated into the IoTeX ecosystem.\\n\\n\\\\[\u201c_A key driver of the value proposition of IoT is the quality of the interaction and coordination across devices, systems, and data. We are excited to be providing decentralized push notifications to the IoT blockchain and adding an important communications dimension to the Trusted Internet of Things_\u201d, commented Harsh Rajat, Founder and Project Lead of the Ethereum Push Notification Service.\\\\]\\n\\nLooking forward, we foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced within IoTeX in particular, and IoT blockchain markets in general. The decentralized IoT blockchain is freeing devices and data from centralized control, and therefore will open up more innovation and opportunities for interoperable IOT networks. Push notifications will be essential to enabling future IoTeX users to take advantage of the improved performance and communication tools in IoT ecosystems. Thus, we view decentralized push notifications as an important service that will accelerate the mass adoption of IoT blockchains. Since IoTeX is at the forefront of new interoperable IOT blockchains, we expect our partnership to yield many new useful notification services and features for the IOT market.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of IoTeX. Users \u2014 who can easily integrate the EPNS protocol into a wallet \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service. Going forward, we also expect to work closely with IoTeX users to create new messaging solutions to meet their evolving push notification needs.\\n\\nWe are pleased to be collaborating with the IoTex IoT blockchain platform and anticipate EPNS push notifications becoming an indispensable tool in decentralized data markets.\\n\\n# **About IoTeX**\\n\\nFounded as an open source platform in 2017, IoTeX is building the Internet of Trusted Things, where all physical and virtual \u201cthings\u201d \u2014 humans, machines, businesses, and DApps \u2014 can exchange information and value at global scale. Backed by a global team of 30+ research scientists and engineers, IoTeX combines blockchain, secure hardware, and decentralized identity innovations to empower intelligent IoT networks and machine economies. By serving as a decentralized trust fabric for IoT, IoTeX will empower the future decentralized economy by \u201cconnecting the physical and digital worlds, block by block\u201d."},{"id":"epns-snapshot-voting","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-snapshot-voting","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-10-epns-snapshot-voting/index.md","title":"EPNS Snapshot Voting: A step by step guide","description":"EPNS Snapshot Voting: A step by step guide","date":"2021-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 10, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Governance","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/governance"},{"label":"Voting","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/voting"},{"label":"Democracy","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/democracy"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"}],"readingTime":1.38,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-snapshot-voting","title":"EPNS Snapshot Voting: A step by step guide","description":"EPNS Snapshot Voting: A step by step guide","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We human being is social animal who enjoys communicating and exchanging ideas, each one having unique ideas and opinion that mostly leads to chaos.

ENS as a decentralized domain name system on Ethereum creates business resiliency by lowering the risk of domain name failure, cyber exploits, and censorship. EPNS is pleased to announce the launch of a pilot program to provide decentralized push notifications to ENS domain name owners so they can maintain a reliable and always on Web 3 presence.\\n\\n### Securing Decentralized Domain Names With Push Notifications\\n\\nThe Ethereum Name Service is an open and distributed naming system on the Ethereum blockchain and the most widely used integrated blockchain naming standard, with over 400k names registered. Website names ending in .eth are mapped to Ethereum addresses, as well as cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS domain name owners benefit by obtaining a decentralized website identity and one meaningful name in place of long addresses for wallets to store cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFTs.\\n\\nENS serves a similar function as the Internet Domain Name Service but uses a decentralized in place of a centralized architecture. In the case of a decentralized DNS, the registrars of the top-level domains like eth are smart contracts. Once assigned a dot-separated hierarchical name, the domain name owner also has control of the subdomains.\\n\\nAnyone can register an ENS domain name or import DNS names. Second level DNS suffixes such as .com or .org also can be used on ENS. ENS domain names can be easily requisitioned and managed through the ENS Manager App or its large ecosystem of wallets, browsers, and other apps. Managing ENS services via messages, however, involves messages from multiple platforms since no central messaging service exists. One essential element is missing, decentralized push notifications. Domain name users are highly dependent on notification services to notify them when their domains will soon expire so they can take action and avoid losing them.\\n\\nBecause domain names are often renewed on an annual basis, lacking a decentralized push notification service, until now, means important notifications may be distributed to multiple places, such as email or a Telegram account. Consequently, the risk of missing a renewal date and the domain name expiring is high. A push notification service would allow you to receive all renewal notices and take timely action on important notifications while still protecting data privacy as ENS users interact with internal and external data sources.\\n\\n# The EPNS Solution\\n\\nThe EPNS decentralized push notification service sends timely notifications through a single source of communication, the investor\u2019s wallet. All notifications go directly to the user\u2019s wallet where they can take immediate action. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet. The partnership benefits to ENS users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all data notifications directly to ENS user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and ENS teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the various push notification needs of decentralized domain name owners.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different data notification requirements.\\n\\n# How EPNS Will Support ENS\\n\\nUnder this pilot program, EPNS is building a dedicated channel for ENS (see our [litepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io) for definitions of channels, services, and more). ENS users can subscribe to the ENS channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets. Through collaboration with the ENS team, we will gain insight into the push notification needs of users of domain name services and what they want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nDecentralized notifications will provide real-time data to one wallet so all users can act in a timely manner. Users can easily register and renew ENS decentralized names for websites, wallets, and other apps on a timely basis. Users can be secure in knowing that the IP and branding of assets like usernames, stores, and avatars are registered, secure, and censorship-resistant while safely operating within the private, secure ecosystem of ENS, without having to deal with integration pains across many different protocols.\\n\\nLooking forward, we foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced for ENS in particular, and the decentralized domain services market in general, such as push notifs for domain name auctions. Push notifications will be essential to enable future ENS users to protect their usernames, and thus IP and digital brand identity. Thus, we view decentralized push notifications as an important service that will accelerate the mass adoption of decentralized business models. Since ENS is at the forefront of creating decentralized domain identities within the Ethereum ecosystem, we expect our partnership to yield many new useful notification services and features for the domain name service market.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of ENS. Web3 username owners \u2014 who can easily integrate the EPNS protocol into a wallet \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service. Going forward, we also expect to work closely with ENS users to create new messaging solutions to meet their evolving push notification needs.\\n\\nWe are pleased to be partnering with ENS and anticipate EPNS push notifications becoming an indispensable tool in the Web 3 ecosystem.\\n\\n# About ENS\\n\\nThe [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://ens.domains/) is an open source blockchain-based naming protocol. Started at the Ethereum Foundation in early 2017, ENS spun off with a separate organization in 2018. ENS development is managed by the Singaporean non-profit True Names LTD and is a public good, a basic piece of Internet infrastructure that belongs to the community.

With this goal in mind, we set ourselves the task to make sure we end Q3 with our EPNS Protocol ready to support multi-chain interoperability.\\n\\n### Understanding the Crucial Changes in the EPNS Protocol\\n\\n#### Protocol Transformation\\n\\nThe EPNS Protocol has now been divided into two different smart contracts, i.e., <i>EPNS Core & EPNS Communicator.</i>\\n\\n1. <b>EPNS Core Protocol</b>: The Core protocol (EPNSCore.sol), as the name might indicate, is the main smart contract as it handles some of the most crucial features like Channel creation, governance, channel state changes as well as funds and incentive mechanisms, etc.\\n\\nIt\u2019s very important to note, however, that the EPNS Core smart contract will only be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and not on any other chain.\\n\\n2. <b>EPNS Communicator Protocol</b>: Unlike the EPNS Core smart contract, the Communicator Protocol (EPNSComm.sol) is designed to be deployed on multiple chains. The EPNS Communicator protocol is comparatively quite simple.\\n\\nThe communicator protocol includes features that allow users to subscribe to a channel, unsubscribe from a channel as well as the imperative one, i.e., sending notifications. As the communicator protocol can be deployed on various chains, it allows us to trigger notifications on multiple chains and not just the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\n#### User Incentives Transformation\\n\\nWith Protocol V1, we move towards blockchain agnostic behavior, the architecture also means that users preferences and notifications validation falls on the network (Push Nodes) as opposed to Ethereum smart contract.\\n\\nWith this new horizon, we understood that our staking (by service) \u2014 lending (by protocol)\u2014 interest (to users) will be complicated (if not improbable) to design for multi-chain. With this in mind, we are pivoting the earning to Push Token holders, the [token already had time weight](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf418588522d5dd018b425e472991e52ebbeeeeee#readContract) built into it when we launched it in April 2021, we will be utilizing this to calculate the interest and distribute to Push holders.\\n\\n<blockquote>Note: This feature still required some work as per the <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/ChainSafeth/status/1452640644397248520\\">audit done by Chainsafe</a>, we will be introducing this feature soon via update once we iron out the clinks.</blockquote>\\n\\nWith that being said, we still are keeping the weight calculation formula on EPNS Communication contracts and will be exploring incentives for the users on different chains as we launch on them.\\n\\nAlright, it\u2019s time to dive deeper and understand the significant details about both of these smart contracts. Let\u2019s begin with the EPNS Core first.\\n\\n### EPNS Core Protocol\\n\\n#### a. Channel Creation on EPNS Core Protocol\\n\\nThe creation of channels as well as storing all the imperative details about a channel is <b>handled only by the EPNS Core protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.</b>\\n\\nBefore we proceed to understand how exactly channels are created in the EPNS Core, it\'s quite important to understand the 4 different states of channels in the protocol.\\n\\nEvery channel in the protocol might have any one of the following states at a given time:\\n\\n1. Inactive State: The Inactive state simply means that a particular address has not been activated as a channel yet, on the EPNS Core protocol.\\n2. Activated State: Once a channel is created for a particular Ethereum address, it is marked as Activated. Activated channels are capable of sending notifications as well as using all other channel-related features available in the protocol.\\n3. Deactivated State: Every active channel has the power to deactivate itself in the protocol and stop providing its services to the users. Deactivation of a particular channel can only be done by the Channel owner.\\n\\nChannel deactivation is not a permanent action as the channel owner can choose to reactivate their channel at any time and can go back from Deactivated to Active state, more on this later. 4. Blocked State: Every Activated or Deactivated channel can be sent to a blocked state. Blocking a particular channel is a permanent action as once blocked, a channel cannot reactivate itself on the EPNS Core protocol again.\\n\\n<blockquote>While as per the current protocol design, only the Push channel admin can block a channel, this power will eventually be shifted to <i>On-Chain Governance.</i></blockquote>\\n\\nAlright, now that we have a brief idea about all the possible states of a Channel in the protocol, let\u2019s understand the channel creation process on EPNS Core.\\n\\nKeeping in mind the fact that the EPNS Core resides only on the Ethereum blockchain, it\u2019s important to note that every channel must be created on Ethereum itself.\\n\\nThe entire channel creation process in the protocol can be well understood by breaking it down into 4 main steps:\\n\\n1. <b>Checkpoints</b>: Before the channel creation process is initiated, the channel address must go through some crucial checkpoints to ensure that it is valid. For instance, some of the significant factors to check are:\\n   a. A channel must not be in an active state before the channel creation process starts.\\n   b. Channel addresses that are already in a blocked state should never be allowed to create channels again.\\n   c. The amount of DAI being deposited for channel creation must be above the minimum threshold, etc.\\n2. <b>Deposit of Channel Creation Fee</b>: Creating a channel on EPNS Core requires a channel creation fee of at least 50 DAI. In order to create a channel, the channel owner must deposit a sum of at least 50 DAI or more.\\n\\nThe amount of DAI transferred by a channel owner while creating their channel is directly deposited on Aave\u2019s lending pool in order to generate interests in aDAI. 3. <b>Storing imperative Channel data</b>: Once the deposited amount is handled properly, the significant details like channel\u2019s pool contribution, state, weight, the channel creation block number as well as the total number of channels in the protocol, etc, are updated and stored on-chain. 4. <b>Subscribing to important channels</b>: As per the current architecture of the protocol, the new channel being created must subscribe to 3 important channels right at the time of its creation:\\na. EPNS Alerter Channel\\nb. Push Channel Admin\\nc. Channel owner must subscribe to its own channel as well.\\nOnce all the above-mentioned steps are completed successfully, the channel\u2019s state is activated and it\'s all set to start sending notifications \ud83d\udd14.\\n\\n#### b. Channel State Cycles\\n\\nAs discussed previously, a channel can have 4 states in the protocol, i.e., inactive, activated, deactivated, and blocked. Now that we already have a better understanding of the activated state of a channel, let\u2019s understand the deactivation, reactivation, and blocking of a channel.\\n\\n1. <b>Channel Deactivation</b>: A channel that is currently in an active state can choose to deactivate itself using the deactivateChannel() function of the protocol. It\u2019s important to note that a channel can only be deactivated by the channel owner.\\n\\nWhen a channel is deactivated, a small amount of 10 DAI is deducted as channel deactivation fees. However, the remaining DAI amount, initially deposited at the time of Channel creation, is refunded back to the channel owner in the form of PUSH tokens.\\n\\nAs previously mentioned, the deactivation of a channel is not a permanent action as the channel owner can choose to reactivate their channel at any time. Moreover, it\'s interesting to note that the channel deactivation fees are added back to the channel\u2019s pool contribution account, once it\'s reactivated. Let\u2019s understand more about this in the reactivate channel section. 2. <b>Channel Reactivation</b>: Any deactivated channel can always be reactivated at any time by calling the reactivateChannel() function of the EPNS Core protocol. Reactivation of a channel can be done by the channel owner only. The reactivateChannel() function basically changes the state of the channel from a deactivated to an activated state.\\n\\nIt\u2019s important to note that while reactivating their channel, the channel owner must deposit a sum of at least 50 DAI or more to complete the reactivation process.\\n\\nAlright, now it\'s time to understand the entire working mechanism of <b>channel activation, deactivation, and reactivation fees.</b>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n1. You Create a new Channel:\\n-> Minimum Channel Creation fees = 50 DAI\\n-> 50 DAI is deposited to create a new channel.\\n-> Channel\u2019s Pool contribution in Core protocol is 50 DAI\\n\\n2. You Deactivate your Channel.\\n   -> Channel Deactivation Fees = 10 DAI\\n   -> 10 DAI is deducted, and 40 DAI is refunded back to you\\n   -> Channel\u2019s Pool contribution in Core protocol now is 10 DAI\\n\\n3. You Reactivate your Channel.\\n-> Minimum reactivation fees = 50 DAI\\n-> You deposit 50 DAI, for channel reactivation.\\n-> Your Channel\u2019s Pool contribution in Core protocol now is 60 DAI\\n(Reactivation Fee(50) + Previous Deactivation Fee(10))\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n![First Image of Roadmap Q3: Audited EPNS Push Protocol V1 is here!](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n3. <b>Blocking a Channel</b>: As the name implies, blocking a channel changes the channel state from Active to Blocked state.\\n\\nSince blocking a channel is a permanent action, once blocked a channel can never go back to the activated state again. A channel can be blocked whenever the blockChannel() function in the protocol is triggered. This function can only be activated by the Push channel admin as of now and no other channel owners can trigger this function.\\n\\nOnce a channel is blocked, it is no more a part of the protocol, and therefore, the total count of channels in the protocol decreases as well.\\n\\nMost importantly, unlike the channel deactivation process in the protocol, blocking a channel doesn\u2019t refund any amount back to the owner of that channel.\\n\\n#### c. Channel Verification Feature\\n\\nEPNS Core contract also includes a new Channel Verification feature which allows Channels to have a verification tag.\\n\\nThe verification tag of a Channel has its own significance. While on one hand, a verified channel enhances the user\u2019s reliability on the channel and its notifications, it also gets a comparatively better position on the User interface.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Channel Verification procedure\\nChannels in the EPNS Core protocol can have either a Primary or a Secondary verification tag.\\n\\na. <b>Primary Verification tag</b>: Channels that have directly been verified by the Push Channel Admin are the ones that have a primary verification tag.\\nAll Primary Verified channels have the power to verify other unverified channels.\\n\\nb. <b>Secondary Verification tag</b>: Channels that have been verified by other Primary Verified channels and not directly by the Push Channel Admin, have a secondary verification tag.\\n\\n<b>Revocation of the Verification Tag</b>\\n\\nThe protocol also allows revocation of the verification tag of any specific channel in specific circumstances. Any channel can be unverified either by the Channel\u2019s actual verifier or Push Channel Admin.\\n\\na. <b>Unverifying a Primary verified channel</b>: The verification tag of a primary verified channel can only be revoked by the Push channel admin.\\nHowever, an imperative part to note here is the fact that once a specific target channel with a primary verification tag is unverified, the secondary verification tag of all those channels that were verified by this target channel will be revoked as well.\\nFor instance:\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n1. Push Channel Admin verifies Channel A \u2014 Primary Verification\\n\\n2. Channel A verifies Channel B, C & D \u2014 Secondary Verification\\n\\n3. Push channel admin revokes the verification of Channel A\\n\\n4. Channel B, C, & D are unverfied as well\\n</blockquote>\\n\\nA quick look at the infographics below will help understand the verification procedure in the core smart contract effectively.\\n\\n![Second Image of Roadmap Q3: Audited EPNS Push Protocol V1 is here!](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nb. <b>Unverifying a Secondary verified channel</b>: A channel with a secondary verification tag can be unverified either by the actual verifier of the channel or by the Push channel admin itself. As channels with secondary verification tags cannot verify other channels, their revocation of the verification tag has no impact on any other Channel\u2019s verification tag.\\n\\nNow that we have quite a better understanding of the EPNS Core protocol, let\u2019s start with EPNS Communicator\\n\\n### EPNS Communicator Protocol\\n\\n#### a. Sending notifications\\n\\nWell, it can undoubtedly be stated that sendNotification() is one of the most imperative functions of the EPNS Communicator protocol. While the older EPNS protocol had a simpler sendNotification function, EPNS Communicator has expanded the boundaries for this feature.\\n\\nUnlike the previous version of the protocol, sending the notification is now not just for the owner of the channels themselves, but there is more to it.\\nLet\u2019s understand this clearly.\\n\\nAs per the current architecture of the Communicator protocol, there can be 4 main actors who can send notifications:\\n\\n1. <b>Channel Owners</b>: It goes without saying, that the owners of a particular channel can definitely send notifications to their subscribers.\\n\\n2. <b>EPNS Alerter</b>: These are the notifications that come from the Push channel admin and are mostly targeted at every user.\\n\\n3. <b>Delegatee Notification Senders</b>: This is a new feature that allows any address to send notifications on behalf of a channel, to its subscribers. However, the notification must be allowed by the channel to do so. More on this later.\\n\\n4. <b>Sending notification to yourself</b>: Yes, the EPNS Communicator allows any address to send notifications to themselves \ud83d\ude03. It\u2019s important to note, however, that the address sends the notification to themselves only. In other words, any address can trigger a notification provided that the recipient of the notification is the caller himself/herself.\\n\\n#### Understanding Delegated Notifications\\n\\nIn very simpler terms, delegated notifications is a feature that allows channel owners to delegate their power of sending notifications to any wallet address or multiple addresses of their choice.\\n\\nThis mechanism of sending delegated notifications is quite effective in providing value-added services to the channels. It also ensures the availability of mechanisms that can be used by EPNS or any other third-party infrastructure to send on-chain notifications on the channel\u2019s behalf.\\n\\nIn order to enable the channel owner to validate a particular address to send notifications on the channel\u2019s behalf, there are 2 specific functions called <i>addDelegate() & removeDelagate()</i> in the Communicator protocol itself.\\n\\nThe channel owner can trigger the above-mentioned functions to either allow or remove an address as a valid notification sender. However, once allowed, the specific address can send a notification to the subscribers on behalf of the channel.\\n\\n#### b. Meta Transactions\\n\\nIt can undeniably be stated that paying gas fees for every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain is still one of the most daunting tasks. If you don\u2019t always have some ETH ready in your wallet, it might be comparatively difficult for you to interact with the protocols on the ethereum blockchain as you need to pay the gas fees.\\n\\nWell, interaction with the EPNS Communicator protocol requires gas as well but don\u2019t worry, we have got you covered.\\n\\nEPNS Communicator protocol supports meta transactions or, in other words, gasless transactions. In simpler terms, the protocol allows you to interact with its functions without actually paying any gas fee.\\n\\nAll you really need to do is simply sign the transaction that you want to put on the blockchain with your keys. This action doesn\u2019t really require any gas fees as you aren\u2019t actually interacting with the protocol on-chain but just signing a transaction.\\n\\nThe signed transaction will then be submitted on the blockchain by the operator by paying some gas fees. Once the transaction is submitted on the blockchain, the communicator protocol verifies your signature to ensure it\u2019s a valid signed transaction and executes the required function on your behalf.\\n\\nThe protocol currently allows meta transactions for the following functions:\\n\\n- subscribe()\\n- unsubscribe()\\n- sendNotification()\\n\\n#### c. Subscribing to a Channel\\n\\nThe subscribe() function in the protocol allows users to subscribe to any channel that is in an activated state.\\n\\nWhile the subscribe function can be called by any address, the caller must pass a valid channel address, that they want to subscribe to, as an input for this function.\\n\\nOnce the subscribe() function is called it performs the following actions:\\n\\n1. <b>Checkpoints</b>:\\n   -> Once the function is called, the push nodes verify whether or not the channel address passed as an input is a valid channel in an active state.\\n\\n-> If the channel is a valid one, the communicator contract then ensures that the caller (subscriber) of the function must not already be subscribed to the channel. If the user is already a subscriber of the channel, the transaction gets reverted.\\n\\n2. <b>User Activation</b>: The subscribe() function also includes an imperative procedure wherein a completely new user that is trying to subscribe to any specific channel for the first time, gets activated and added to the protocol first. At this step, the total user count in that particular Communicator contract is increased as well.\\n\\n3. <b>Subscribed to the Channel</b>: Once the checkpoints are passed successfully, the user is added as a valid subscriber of the given channel address\\n4. <b>User information storage</b>: As the final step of this function, all the relevant and crucial information about the user is stored in the protocol. At this step, the subscribed_Count of the user, i.e., the total number of channels a single user is subscribed to, is also increased.\\n\\n#### d. Unsubscribing a Channel\\n\\nThe unsubscribe() function in the protocol is quite simple, as the name already suggests.\\n\\nIt allows users to unsubscribe from a specific channel, provided that the caller of the function was already subscribed to that channel before. The unsubscribe() function updates the user\u2019s state in the protocol by removing it as a subscriber for the given channel and decreasing the total subscribed_Count of the user."},{"id":"timeswap-partners-with-epns","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/timeswap-partners-with-epns","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-02-timeswap-partners-with-epns/index.md","title":"Timeswap Partners with EPNS To Bring Push Notifications to Its Users","description":"Timeswap Partners with EPNS To Bring Push Notifications to Its Users","date":"2021-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 2, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"}],"readingTime":1.9233333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"timeswap-partners-with-epns","title":"Timeswap Partners with EPNS To Bring Push Notifications to Its Users","description":"Timeswap Partners with EPNS To Bring Push Notifications to Its Users","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain went from being just a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d to a full-fledged financial sector offering a whole range of financial services in a decentralized fashion.

However, the financial services that witnessed the biggest shift in their operations through decentralized finance are lending and borrowing. We can say that they entered a new dimension, creating a world of possibilities.\\n\\nDeFi has made it possible for anyone in the world to borrow from anyone else in a decentralized, trustless, and permissionless manner. The lending protocols and underlying smart contracts ensured that through this entire ordeal user assets are secured and that lenders get what they lent and the promised interest. But, because of the lack of a proper communication system across these DeFi platforms (read protocols), borrowers sometimes miss the deadline to pay back what they owe. This creates a complicated scenario, leading to their collateral getting liquidated.\\n\\nThis is why we at EPNS have partnered with the lending protocol Timeswap to enable decentralized push notifications for lenders and borrowers on the platform.\\n\\n### How Timeswap Can Benefit from EPNS Push Notifications\\n\\nTimeswap is the first oracle-less and truly permissionless lending and borrowing protocol for the DeFi space. It is a revolutionary protocol that aims to redefine money markets with its constant product AMM (automated market maker). It allows any user on the platform to lend or borrow any ERC-20 token with any other ERC-20 token as collateral.\\n\\nThe platform also allows projects on the Ethereum network to borrow funds using their native token as collateral. The interest rates and loan periods are flexible and the protocol itself is gas efficient. This makes Timeswap the perfect protocol for users who are getting started with lending and borrowing in DeFi.\\n\\nBecause of the flexible timeframes, it is possible that borrowers miss the maturity period or even lenders miss out on withdrawing funds after maturity. This is where the partnership with EPNS could be game-changing.\\n\\n# EPNS Helps Timeswap Create a Rich User Experience\\n\\nThrough our partnership with Timeswap, we aim to create a reliable communication channel for the protocol to be able to efficiently communicate with its users. Users of Timeswap can now subscribe to EPNS to receive notifications about their loans.\\n\\n- Borrowers can receive notifications whenever the maturity date of the loan approaches so that they can pay it back on time.\\n- The lenders can receive notifications when it is time for them to withdraw their deposits after maturity.\\n\\nThe incorporation of EPNS Push notifications can assist Timeswap in its efforts to revolutionize money markets creating a hassle-free, no friction experience for its users. We hope to become an integral part of the protocol in the near future.\\n\\n# About TimeSwap\\n\\nTimeswap is the first fully permissionless, oracle-less, non-liquidatable, fixed maturity lending & borrowing protocol. Timeswap uses an AMM for interest rate discovery and collateral ratio determination. The protocol allows lenders and borrowers to set \u2018interest\u2019 and \u2018insurance\u2019 parameters that are determined along a constant product bonding curve, effectively allowing users to structure bonds against a pooled counterparty. Liquidity Providers can create pools with fixed maturities for any pair of tokens, allowing for the creation of debt markets across long tail assets.

Yield farming and staking have been popular for a while but recently, investors are leaning towards trading crypto derivatives. Crypto options have become immensely popular on cryptocurrency exchanges these days.\\n\\nIn this context, options traders need to be constantly updated about the status of the underlying asset, the expiry date of the contract, and when they can exercise their option. This is why EPNS partnered with the popular options trading platform Pods Finance to enable push notifications for their users (options buyers, sellers and liquidity providers).\\n\\n### How Pods Finance Can Benefit from Push Notifications\\n\\nPods Finance is a decentralized options trading protocol that enables users to hedge or to get additional exposure to crypto assets on Ethereum. It has an specific Options AMM that allows users to buy, sell or provide liquidity to options of any ERC20 token. The simple user interface of the platform ensures that users can do such actions with minimal friction.\\n\\nUsers can choose an option on the platform, pay the premium to receive its rights, and wait for the expiration period. Once the expiration date approaches, if the option is in-the-money, users can exercise their right and sell or buy the underlying asset at strike price.\\n\\nFor the smooth running of this process, there needs to be a proper communication channel between users and the network. The lack of such a channel creates friction and users have to constantly keep a check on their options or they might end up missing their exercising time period, which can cause financial losses to users.\\n\\nThis is why we\u2019ve partnered with Pods Finance to create a robust communication channel for the users and the network.\\n\\n# What Does the Partnership Entail\\n\\nThrough our partnership with Pods Finance, we at EPNS aim to facilitate decentralized push notifications for their users. These notifications help users stay on track with options contracts and exercise them at the right time. Users of Pods Finance can subscribe to receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- The price of the underlying asset approaches the sell threshold.\\n- The price of the asset approaches the buy threshold.\\n- The expiry date of the contract approaches.\\n\\nAs Pods Finance continues to revolutionize crypto derivatives, we\u2019re pleased to partner with them to amplify their efforts and take the protocol to new heights. We hope to be an integral part of the Pods ecosystem.\\n\\n# About Pods\\n\\nPods is a decentralized non-custodial options protocol.

RabbitHole helps projects attract long-term contributors to their communities through on-chain resumes and rewards for skill-building on various project protocols. EPNS is delighted to jump into the rabbit hole and announce the launch of a pilot program to provide decentralized push notifications to support RabbitHole\u2019s development of long-term contributors to Web3 projects.\\n\\n### Developing the Web3 Jobs Economy With Push Notifications\\n\\nThe RabbitHole is a network built to help projects quickly bootstrap and build sustainable communities by attracting long-term contributors. RabbitHole is creating the on-chain resume for the future of work. By re-organizing how talent is attracted, the protocol is helping to reshape the future of work and how we engage, train, and retain talent. Through the gamification of learning, project treasuries distribute their tokens to incentivize contributors to participate in their network.\\n\\nThe protocol uses crypto incentives to help Web3 contributors build skills and on-chain credentials. For those seeking to develop new Web3 skills, users can participate in activities to build skills ranging from asset manager to NFT creator while participating in incentivized activities on major protocols like UnisSwap, Compound, OpenSea, and Gnosis. Meanwhile, participants develop on-chain credentials and a resume based on proven on-chain skills instead of a social media reputation or conventional resume.\\n\\nRabbitHole has developed a healthy network of leading DeFi protocols ready to assign tasks to new contributors and reward them for their participation. Ensuring all future contributors are informed of tasks and rewards, however, involves messages from multiple platforms yet no central messaging service exists. One essential element is missing, decentralized push notifications. The RabbitHole network users are highly dependent on notification services to communicate important information, including notifications on:\\n\\n- When rewards have been distributed\\n- New quests issued by protocols\\n- When a quest is starting and ending\\n\\nAs RabbitHole decentralizes into a DAO, users will also rely on push notifs to actively take part in the platform\u2019s self-governance process. Yet the lack of a decentralized push notification service, until now, means important notifications may be distributed to multiple places, such as email or a Telegram account. A push notification service would allow all platform users to receive and take timely action on important campaign notifications while still protecting data privacy as RabbitHole users interact with internal and external data sources.\\n\\n\\\\[\u201cRabbithole is delighted to see solutions come along that reduce information asymmetry. As we build out our infrastructure for quests EPNS is a valuable partner in helping onboard informed users into web3\u201d commented Tim Black, Product Manager at RabbitHole.\\\\]\\n\\n# The EPNS Solution\\n\\nThe EPNS decentralized push notification service sends timely notifications through a single source of communication, the investor\u2019s wallet. All notifications go directly to the user\u2019s wallet where they can take immediate action. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet. The partnership benefits to RabbitHole users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all data notifications directly to RabbitHole user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and RabbitHole teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the various push notification needs of the different contributors to projects.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different data notification requirements.\\n\\n# How EPNS Will Support RabbitHole\\n\\nUnder this pilot program, EPNS is building a dedicated channel for RabbitHole (see our [litepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io) for definitions of channels, services, and more). RabbitHole users can subscribe to the RabbitHole channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets. Through collaboration with the RabbitHole team, we will gain insight into the push notification needs of users of community-building platforms and what they want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nDecentralized notifications will provide real-time data to one wallet so all users can act in a timely manner. Users can be informed of all opportunities to match their skills to and take ownership in projects. Projects can use on-chain information to find future contributors and keep them in the information flow on quests and rewards with push notifs. Meanwhile, all users can continue to operate within the private, secure ecosystem of RabbitHole across different project protocols, without having to deal with integration pains across many different protocols.\\n\\n\\\\[\u201dThe timely delivery of notifications will be essential for talent to develop on-chain credentials for the future of work on Web3. Reliable notifications will ensure rewards and incentives are aligned with project protocol task achievements, and thus motivate sustainable contributor commitments to projects,\u201d commented Harsh Rajat, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service.\\\\]\\n\\nLooking forward, we foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced for RabbitHole in particular, and project campaigns in general. Push notifications will streamline the matching of contributors with Web3 projects based on the on-chain resume for the future of work. Projects will rely on notifs to incentivize users through rewards and built-in on-chain vesting.\\n\\nThus, we view decentralized push notifications as an important service that will support the building of long-term sustainable communities. Since RabbitHole is at the forefront of creating new ways to reshape the future of work for Web3, we expect our partnership to yield many new useful notification services and features for the decentralized lending market.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of RabbitHole. Project contributors \u2014 who can easily integrate the EPNS protocol into a wallet \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service.

It plays a key role in ensuring decentralization within the ecosystem.\\n\\nAll the present-day blockchain networks have robust governance and consensus protocols. But, what they lack is an effective communication channel that keeps the users updated on the voting process. This leads to reduced participation levels, ultimately reducing the level of actual degree of decentralization.\\n\\nThis is why we\u2019ve partnered with the MakerDAO Development and UX (DUX) Core Unit to enable decentralized push notifications for polling and governance updates.\\n\\n# How MakerDAO can Leverage Decentralized Notifications\\n\\nMakerDAO is a decentralized protocol that lets users generate Dai against a variety of crypto assets locked in a specialized smart contract called Vault. The project was built with a long-term goal of unleashing the full potential of DeFi by bringing innovative financial tools to the ecosystem.\\n\\nFor Maker, it all started with the vision to one day truly decentralize the protocol. And in July, Rune Christensen, Maker Foundation CEO, announced that MakerDAO had achieved complete decentralization.\\n\\nTo achieve this, the protocol has a two-tier voting system in place. In the first tier, a poll is created on the governance portal to establish a consensus among the community members. The second tier entails a process where an executive poll is created for community members to vote on technical changes proposed to the protocol.\\n\\nIn this context, all the community members need to keep a constant watch on the governance portal or social channels to be informed whenever a new poll is created. Failure to do so might result in missed voting chances and overall less community participation.\\n\\nBy enabling decentralized push notification for the community through EPNS, Maker Governance participants will be able to more easily stay informed of governance-related activities.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Warrant?\\n\\nBy partnering with the MakerDAO Development and UX (DUX) Core Unit, we aim to build a proper communication medium between the network and users. This will reduce users\u2019 dependency on third-party media and ensure that they receive timely polling and governance updates. This, in turn, will reduce friction and ensure that all users participate in the network governance. Users can subscribe to receive notifications whenever:\\n\\n- A new poll is created\\n- A new executive proposal is created\\n- A poll ends\\n- An executive proposal ends\\n- An executive proposal is passed\\n\\nAs MakerDAO continues working towards revolutionizing DeFi, we are pleased to be partnering with them in an effort to improve the network\u2019s communication with its users. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of the Maker protocol.\\n\\n# About MakerDAO\\n\\nMakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that enables the generation of Dai, against digital assets without the need for a middleman.

Because humanity is the essence of these humans, is there a better place than this to start discussing our protocol\u2019s use-cases? Probably not. So that\u2019s where we begin, by elaborating the collaboration between EPNS and [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) (PoH).\\n\\nProof of Humanity \u2014 a.k.a. \u2018The Internet of Humans\u2019 \u2014 is an ecosystem for decentralized identities, facilitating the establishment and verification of community-governed trust. PoH is crucial to differentiate bots from humans without entrusting centralized (and therefore, corruptible) actors.\\n\\n# The Future of Web3: Trust & PoH\\n\\nDecentralization and trustlessness are quite inseparable. But understanding the latter as a call for the complete elimination of trust is a mistake that people often commit. Trust is an undeniable asset for humanity, a precondition for harmonious progress.\\n\\nThough trustlessness enables counterparties to interact securely even when they do not (or cannot) trust each other, there are real-life instances where trust is necessary. The future needs innovative models for trust and social identification, particularly in view of its optimal decentralization.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, the PoH Registry is poised to become one of the pivotal elements of the Web3 stack. And for its part, EPNS is thrilled to have the opportunity of contributing to PoH\u2019s progress.\\n\\n# Enhancing the PoH Experience with EPNS\\n\\nBesides Self-Sovereign Identities (SSIDs), PoH enables individuals to access decentralized certifications, quadratic funding, credit scoring, etc. Herein lies PoH\u2019s significance, as these services are foundational to building comprehensive Web3 systems. Especially concerning optimal day-to-day relevance, which is pretty much the need of the hour. Realizing PoH\u2019s role and potential, EPNS now strives to make its user experience seamless.\\n\\nA PoH profile can be in either of these phases: **Submission**, **Challenge**, **Vouching**, and **Registered**. Submitting a profile entails [multiple steps](https://blog.kleros.io/proof-of-humanity-an-explainer/), making it somewhat meticulous from the end-user\u2019s perspective. The story doesn\u2019t end there, though. To ease the journey from submission to being registered, EPNS notifies users about various profile-related updates in real-time. In courtesy of the collaboration, PoH users will have the following benefits:\\n\\n- Existing PoH profile holders whose profile has been challenged will be immediately notified allowing them to act in time to save their submission from being removed.\\n- Users will also be notified when the challenger submits new evidence for their claim.\\n- Notifications upon removal requests for other reasons, such as inadequate information for instance.\\n- Users will receive a notification when their profile is registered because there\u2019s no valid challenge.\\n- Notifications about upcoming profile expiration.\\n\\n# It\u2019s Only the Beginning\\n\\nEPNS\u2019s scope concerning Proof of Humanity is vast, and profile-related notifications are only the humble beginning. From Universal Basic Income (UBI) transactions to upcoming airdrops or new certificate issuance, the future holds myriad possibilities.\\n\\nTrust is, after all, a sensitive matter. In today\u2019s age of information, it is unacceptable for one\u2019s credibility to take a dent simply for the lack of timely awareness. EPNS\u2019s collaboration with PoH is a journey towards mitigating such mishaps.\\n\\nIndividuals won\u2019t ever miss an update from PoH by subscribing to its channel on EPNS. And Web3 will become more reliable and secure as a whole because the chances of interacting with bots instead of humans will be minimal.\\n\\n# About Proof of Humanity\\n\\nProof of Humanity is an Ethereum-based platform for the creation and management of decentralized Digital Identities. The PoH ecosystem leverages webs of trust and reverse Turing tests to create a Sybil-proof and AI-resistant identity registry for humans on the blockchain. Besides facilitating reliable and non-intermediated social verifications, PoH enables myriad use-cases including innovative DAOs, anti-spam tools, and consensus mechanisms for sidechains. In view of these use-cases, PoH emerges as a stepping stone to a more robust and anti-fragile Web3.\\n\\nStay in touch!

Adding incentives and penalties will greatly improve quality participation.\\n\\n# Development \ud83d\udea7\\n\\nThis month many development initiatives that we have been working on are coming together and started the release process.\\n\\n## Smart Contract Audit in progress \ud83d\udc6e\ud83c\udffc\\n\\nA big part of this month\u2019s effort was towards finishing the Protocol segmentation and its corresponding test cases. The formal Audit Process with ChainSafe was initiated by mid-September, and we expect to finish this process within the next couple of weeks.\\n\\n## Showrunners Framework Plug & Play\ud83e\udd16\\n\\nUpon passing a very intense period of testing in our development and staging environments, the Showrunners Framework Plug & Play is almost out! This framework allows services to trigger notifications using off-chain and on-chain logic.\\n\\nTogether with this framework release, we are also providing a step by step **video tutorial** to explain how to easily create your channels. Additionally, we are making things simpler by creating a Github template, and a step by step written guide.\\n\\n## Showrunners channels \ud83d\udcfa\\n\\nHow could we battle-test our revamped Showrunners Framework? You are right! We developed and continue developing more new channels for our awesome Pilot Collabs with the most important protocols in the space.\\n\\n**Channels in the release pipeline:** Oasis.App, bZx, B.Protocol, TracerDAO.\\n\\n**Channels in Development:** PoolTogether, CVI (Crypto Volatility Index), Armor.fi, IDLE Finance.\\n\\nAs usual, with every channel, we learn something new that helps us improve our protocol and our tooling for developers. This month a lot of the lessons learned were applied to the development of the Showrunners framework itself.\\n\\n## Channel Discovery features \ud83d\udd2e\\n\\n![Second Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nThis feature required coordinating and developing different components to communicate effectively. Backend APIs, Mobile application builds, updates to the Chrome Browser Extension. The good news is it\'s now complete and ready for release!\\n\\nA new version of the mobile app will be released over the next couple of weeks. For now, here is a sneak peek in case you missed it before!\\n\\n## FrontEnd-SDK \ud83c\udfa8\\n\\nSimilarly to the Showrunners Framework, this release will happen soon and will also include code snippets and samples for developers to easily fetch, parse and show notifications on-screen on your dApps and Mobile Apps.\\n\\nWe are additionally including a WYSIWYG tool to preview how notifications will look like before you send them.\\n\\nGithub repo and documentation coming soon!\\n\\n## Sending Payloads directly to the PUSH Nodes \ud83d\udc7e\\n\\nThis was an Alpha leak \ud83d\ude1c by Harsh at [Messari Mainnet 2021](https://youtu.be/xDhyQQLishU?t=1363)!\\n\\nIn our mission to become the de-facto middleware communication layer for the web2 and the web3, we are opening for services the possibility to interface directly with the PUSH Nodes by dropping payloads directly to them. At this initial stage PUSH nodes will verify that the transaction is coming signed by either the channel owner or one of the delegated wallets for the channel.\\n\\nWhile this is a work in progress and will require more testing and fine-tuning, the demo presented at the Messari Mainnet Conference is a fully working demo that we are hardening and extending as we see fit.\\n\\n## Polygon connect \ud83d\udd37\\n\\nAnother Alpha leak dropped during Messari Mainnet. Following the mission mentioned above, our team set to the task of making sure that the EPNS protocol can work and communicate effectively across chains. With this in mind, we deployed the EPNS communicator contract in Polygon, and have been running rounds of testing to ensure that notifications are being triggered and delivered correctly.\\n\\nDeploying the contracts is just a part of this task \u2014 ensuring that all other EPNS products are compatible is also a big part of it; and while PUSH Nodes play a very critical role in this equation, our team is making sure that Mobile App, Browser Extension, SDKs, and APIs are rock solid with this approach.\\n\\n# More frens, more fun! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\\n\\nWe keep growing our list of awesome Frens, and we couldn\u2019t be more grateful and excited about this.\\n\\n[**CVI (Crypto Volatility Index)**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1433439003215220738?s=20): to implement notifications for users about unexpected changes in index value, updates about upcoming market events, updates about user\u2019s margin positions approaching liquidation, and even arbitrage opportunities specific to the CVI arbitrageurs group.\\n\\n[**Kyber Network**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1440357337093398545?s=20): with this collaboration Kyber looks to notify users about the launch of new liquidity mining programs, pools, and integrations; as well as stream price feeds, alerts about new Kyber Improvement Proposals and more.\\n\\n[**Open Leverage**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1441084477384495108?s=20): this collaboration looks to provide notifications to users when prices move beyond a certain threshold, and also when your position is about to be liquidated or is approaching liquidation.\\n\\n[**Armor.fi**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1442489466799550475?s=20): aims at implementing notifications for their users when any of the protocols they have arCore smart cover for has been hacked, or any of the protocols they have an arNFT for has been hacked as well. Additionally, when user\u2019s arNFT are about to expire, or if their Smart Cover is below or above x% of the actual wallet value and should be updated.\\n\\n[**EasyFi**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1443214048808472576?s=20): with EasyFi, we are looking to implement Web3 notifications to alert about upcoming loan liquidations, changes in interest rates, collateralization ratios and liquidation alerts, Governance-related notifications, and more.\\n\\n# EPNS in the news \ud83d\udcfa\\n\\nWe are ecstatic with all the happenings on this front this month \ud83d\ude07.

Through permissionless lending lenders and borrowers have easy access to liquidity, yet sers on such DeFi platforms face a risk to their funds due to lack of proper communication from the platforms regarding any transaction or activity or incident that happens there.\\n\\nSo be it a change of interest rate that may result in low-yield, or a risk of liquidation of supplied collateral due to a sudden fall in asset price, timely interventions will go a long way in giving confidence to a user on a lending protocol.\\n\\nNeedless to say, timely and efficient communication tools are at the center of matching borrowers and lenders at the optimal interest rates for both parties. Managing lending and liquidation, however, involves messages from multiple platforms yet no central messaging service exists.\\n\\nAn essential element that will play a part in improving services and user adoption is **_decentralized push notifications_**. DeFi lending platform users are highly dependent on notification services to facilitate lending services, including:\\n\\n- Loan liquidation alerts\\n- Changes in interest rates\\n- Collateralization ratios and liquidation alerts\\n- Governance-related notifications, and more.\\n\\nA push notification service would hence remove the friction of the unknown and allow all platform users to receive and take timely action on important lending notifications while still protecting data privacy as users interact with internal and external data sources.\\n\\n# The EPNS Solution\\n\\nThe EPNS decentralized push notification service sends timely notifications through a single source of communication, the investor\u2019s wallet. All notifications go directly to the user\u2019s wallet where they can take immediate action. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet.\\n\\nThe partnership benefits to EasyFi users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all data notifications directly to EasyFi user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and EasyFi teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the various push notification needs of lenders and borrowers.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different data notification requirements.\\n\\n# How EPNS Will Support EasyFi\\n\\nUnder this pilot program,\\n\\n- EPNS is building a dedicated channel for EasyFi (see our [litepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io) for definitions of channels, services, and more).\\n- EasyFi users can subscribe to the EasyFi channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets.\\n- Through collaboration with the EasyFi team, we will gain insight into the push notification needs of users of lending platforms and what they want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nDecentralized notifications will provide real-time data to one wallet so all users can act in a timely manner. Lenders and borrowers can identify the most attractive interest rates and fees across lending platforms. Meanwhile, all users can continue to operate within the private, secure ecosystem of EasyFi\u2019s multi-chain lending ecosystem, without having to deal with integration pains across many different protocols.\\n\\n\\\\[\u201c_The EPNS development team has enthusiastically embraced the excitement and possibilities of instant notifs on Layer 2 DeFi solutions. So are we delighted in the opportunity to work with EasyFi, a lending protocol pushing the innovation frontier in the development of structured lending products leveraging the speed and scale of Layer 2. EPNS push notifs will ensure EasyFi users never miss an opportunity to reduce risk and improve yields through EasyFi\u2019s structured lending products,\u201dcommented Harsh Rajat, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service._\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[_Anshul Dhir, CoFounder & COO, EasyFi Network said \u2014 \u201cAs we move into high gear with full protocol launch and implementation of new products and services on EasyFi, we foresee a need to make engagement on our multichain protocol easier and intuitive for the user. Our collaboration with EPNS and the integration of push notifications on our protocol, will drive this commitment and improve overall engagement, with users taking their own decisions starting with which alert they want to receive!\u201d_\\\\]\\n\\n# Looking Forward\\n\\nWe foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced for EasyFi in particular, and DeFi lending markets in general. Easy-to-configure push notifications will enable future EasyFi users to take advantage of all products and services on EasyFi App.\\n\\nWe view decentralized push notifications as an important service that will accelerate the mass adoption of decentralized lending. Since EasyFi is at the forefront of creating structured lending products that improve permissionless lending markets, we expect our partnership to yield many new useful notification services and features for the decentralized lending market.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of EasyFi. DeFi lending users \u2014 who can easily integrate the EPNS protocol into a wallet \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service. Going forward, we also expect to work closely with EasyFi users to create new messaging solutions to meet their evolving push notification needs.\\n\\nWe are pleased to be partnering with EasyFi and anticipate EPNS push notifications becoming an indispensable tool in DeFi lending markets.\\n\\n# About EasyFi\\n\\nEasyFi is a universal layer 2 lending protocol built for DeFi focused on scalability, composability, and adoption. It has been designed as an open and inclusive financial network infrastructure running on public networks to facilitate the end-to-end lending and borrowing of digital assets and related financial products.

While DeFi protocols managed to carve a space for themselves and gain popularity among users in the past few years, they also gained popularity among hackers.\\n\\nTheir largely open-source software and pseudonymous nature make it easier for hackers to siphon large amounts of money from the protocol in an almost untraceable way. When this happens, users, more often than not, end up losing their funds. This is where a protocol like Armor is needed. It is the blockchain equivalent of a mutual fund that provides discretionary cover aiming to protect user funds.\\n\\nBy partnering with this next-generation protocol, we aim to solidify the protection of assets by establishing proper communication between users and the protocol.\\n\\n# Armor Goes a Step Further with Push Notifications\\n\\n[Armor](https://armor.fi/) is a decentralized protocol that protects user assets held on different DeFi protocols to cover unforeseen situations like hacks and attacks. Armor provides pay-as-you-go coverage for user funds and investments across popular protocols such as Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, Balancer, and over 80 more. The coverage is underwritten by Nexus Mutual and is permissionless.\\n\\nUsers are required to buy a Nexus Mutual Cover for a certain amount of asset (eg. 100ETH) which is represented as an arNFT on-chain. arNFT holders can sell, trade, or stake the NFT to earn rewards. Armor also provides an arCore smart cover that tracks user funds as they move across different protocols and charge by the second. This results in cost efficiency and flexibility.\\n\\nNow, users who have an arNFT or an arCore smart cover are definitely protected from hacks, but they need to keep a constant eye on third-party communication media to know if the protocol is hacked (as happened earlier this week with C.R.E.A.M.!) or if their cover is expiring. By enabling decentralized push notifications through EPNS, Armor would be able to circumvent these problems and provide timely updates to its users.\\n\\n# What Does the Partnership Entail?\\n\\nThrough our partnership with Armor, we aim to build a proper communication channel that reduces friction between the protocol and their users, and provides them with all the required updates. Users of Armor will be able to subscribe to the notification service to receive updates whenever:\\n\\n- Any of the protocols they have arCore smart cover for has been hacked.\\n- Any of the protocols they have an arNFT for has been hacked.\\n- Their arNFT is about to expire.\\n- Their Smart Cover is below or above x% of the actual wallet value and should be updated.\\n\\nThese are just the first 4 out of a few dozen useful notifications we have identified with the Armor team. As Armor continues securing user funds on various protocols, we\u2019re pleased to partner with them to provide notifications for their users. We wish to become an integral part of the Armor network and hope that the notifications help improve their user experience as a whole.\\n\\n# About Armor\\n\\nArmor makes investing in DeFi as safe as possible with crypto-native, dynamic smart coverage aggregation. As a decentralized brokerage, Armor\u2019s innovations provide on-demand, real-time coverage and non-custodial security solutions for user assets. Armor\u2019s focus is on building an ecosystem of interoperable protocols and products to secure and scale mass adoption of DeFi both with institutions and individuals.\\n\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/armorfi) | [Telegram](http://t.me/ArmorFi) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/8HuTB22) | [Website](https://armor.fi/) | [Github](https://github.com/ArmorFi) | [Announcements](http://t.me/armor_ann)"},{"id":"openleverage-decentralized-push-notifs","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/openleverage-decentralized-push-notifs","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-23-openleverage-decentralized-push-notifs/index.md","title":"OpenLeverage Leverages Decentralized Push Notifications with EPNS","description":"OpenLeverage Leverages Decentralized Push Notifications with EPNS","date":"2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 23, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Openleverage","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/openleverage"}],"readingTime":0.9066666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"openleverage-decentralized-push-notifs","title":"OpenLeverage Leverages Decentralized Push Notifications with EPNS","description":"OpenLeverage Leverages Decentralized Push Notifications with EPNS","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"The boom of decentralized finance allowed for permissionless trading, listing, and rapid growth of liquidity and volume.

Although users have seen a plethora of DeFi applications, even the degen of degens finds it difficult to discover permissionless markets for leveraged trading. Existing decentralized leverage trading platforms provide minimal pairs and market depth. To truly build DeFi\u2019s vision of global financial access, there needs to be a decentralized, permissionless, scalable, secure leverage trading facility that serves the long tail and fast-growing DeFi market.\\n\\nOpenLeverage is a permissionless margin trading protocol, which enables traders to long or short any trading pair on DEXs efficiently and securely. OpenLeverage Protocol aims to create an entirely permissionless decentralized margin trading infrastructure. Therefore, no permission must be needed to create a margin trading market for any pair.\\n\\nWith the huge potential OpenLeverage possesses, we at EPNS, are glad to announce our pilot program collaboration with OpenLeverage. During this pilot program we will be working with OpenLeverage to:\\n\\n- Provide notifications when prices move beyond a certain threshold.\\n- Provide notifications when your position is about to be liquidated or is approaching liquidation.\\n\\nWe are delighted that OpenLeverage is \u201cleveraging\u201d EPNS to push decentralized notifications and take one more step towards decentralizing the communication layer of DeFi and Web3.\\n\\n# **About OpenLeverage.Finance**\\n\\nOpenLeverage is a permissionless margin trading protocol, which enables traders to long or short any trading pair on DEXs efficiently and securely.\\n\\nTo learn more about [OpenLeverage](https://openleverage.finance/):\\n\\nJoin OpenLeverage [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/DmZCpgBZY3) | Follow [@OpenLeverage](https://twitter.com/OpenLeverage) on Twitter | Join OpenLeverage [Telegram](https://t.me/openleverage) group"},{"id":"epns-push-notifications-to-support-kyber","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-push-notifications-to-support-kyber","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-21-epns-push-notifications-to-support-kyber/index.md","title":"EPNS Push Notifications to Support Kyber\u2019s Frictionless Liquidity Pools","description":"EPNS Push Notifications to Support Kyber\u2019s Frictionless Liquidity Pools","date":"2021-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 21, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Openleverage","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/openleverage"}],"readingTime":3.8666666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-push-notifications-to-support-kyber","title":"EPNS Push Notifications to Support Kyber\u2019s Frictionless Liquidity Pools","description":"EPNS Push Notifications to Support Kyber\u2019s Frictionless Liquidity Pools","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Under most static AMM models, liquidity providers (LPs) often have low incentives to provide liquidity owing to illiquid markets with high volatility that reward profit-seeking arbitrageurs.","tags":["Epnsproject","Ethereum","Notifications","Openleverage"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"OpenLeverage Leverages Decentralized Push Notifications with EPNS","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/openleverage-decentralized-push-notifs"},"nextItem":{"title":"EPNS \ud83d\udc95 Gitcoin","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-gitcoin-2021"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover Image of EPNS Push Notifications to Support Kyber\u2019s Frictionless Liquidity Pools](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nUnder most static AMM models, liquidity providers (LPs) often have low incentives to provide liquidity owing to illiquid markets with high volatility that reward profit-seeking arbitrageurs.\\n\\nThe Kyber Network liquidity hub is empowering both DEX aggregators and LPs by connecting liquidity from many protocols and sources and optimizing capital utilization and fees through a dynamic market making model. EPNS is pleased to announce the launch of a pilot program to provide decentralized push notifications to support users of Kyber\u2019s deeper and more capital efficient liquidity pools.\\n\\n# EPNS Notifs Support Customized, Capital Efficient Liquidity Pools\\n\\nThe Kyber Network has grown into the largest liquidity pool hub with over 6 [billion USD](https://kyber.network/) in total volume by aggregating liquidity across hundreds of dApps, crypto wallets and DeFi platforms. In addition to Kyber\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol KyberDMM, over 100 applications including wallets and token swaps integrate with the Kyber Network to access liquidity. By providing LPs with the flexibility of market makers, they can more efficiently manage capital utilization and rebalance their token portfolios. With this increased flexibility, LPs have the potential to earn higher yields.\\n\\nAdopting Uber-style surge pricing, KyberDMM\u2019s dynamic market maker model is up to 500x more capital efficient than traditional AMMs. The DMM uses amplified pools with dynamic fees that increase or decrease in periods of high or low volatility, respectively, according to an amplification factor. In this way, the DMM optimizes returns while reducing volatility, and thus slippage and the risk of impermanent loss.\\n\\ndApps can easily integrate with Kyber to access frictionless liquidity to support diverse functions including token swaps, on-chain liquidation, portfolio rebalancing, and flash loans. Managing these services, however, involves messages from multiple platforms yet no central messaging service exists. One essential element is missing, decentralized push notifications. The growing Kyber liquidity hub and its users require notification services to:\\n\\n- introduce and integrate new protocols and chains (e.g., Polygon, BSC)) into the network\\n- launch of new liquidity mining programs, pools, and integrations\\n- announce special offers and special educational events\\n- stream price feeds\\n- send real time transaction status to users\\n- provide new KIP (Kyber Improvement Proposal) alerts\\n- broadcast notifications for any KNC token upgrades\\n- make milestone announcements on TVL and volume\\n\\nAs \u2018Kyber-style\u2019 pools are adopted on Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and other blockchains; the need for push notifs is growing. The lack of a decentralized push notification service, until now, means important notifications may be distributed to multiple places, such as email or a Telegram account. A push notification service would allow all platform users to receive and take timely action on important notifications while still protecting data privacy as Kyber users interact with internal and external data sources.\\n\\n_\\\\[\u201cEPNS brings a much needed solution to Ethereum and other networks \u2014 a convenient way to access timely information on-chain. The Kyber Network ecosystem is moving and developing fast, so users would definitely appreciate this kind of notification service.\u201d, commented Loi Luu, CEO and Co-Founder, Kyber Network\\\\]_\\n\\n# The EPNS Solution\\n\\nThe EPNS decentralized push notification service sends timely notifications through a single source of communication, the investor\u2019s wallet. All notifications go directly to the user\u2019s wallet where they can take immediate action on important information. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet. The partnership benefits to Kyber Network users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all data notifications directly to Kyber user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and Kyber teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the various push notification needs of users of decentralized swap markets and liquidity pools.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different requirements.\\n\\n# How EPNS Will Support the Kyber Network\\n\\nUnder this pilot program, EPNS is building a dedicated channel for the Kyber Network (see our [litepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io) for definitions of channels, services, and more). Kyber users can subscribe to the Kyber channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets. Through collaboration with the Kyber team, we will gain insight into the push notification needs of users of swap markets with advanced features (e.g., liquidity aggregation, dynamic market making) and what they want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nDecentralized notifications will provide real-time data to one wallet so all users can act in a timely manner. Market makers can identify the most attractive fees to rebalance portfolios. Takers can source liquidity from KyberDMM protocol with lower slippage. Meanwhile, all users and Dapps can continue to operate within the secure ecosystem of Kyber Network, without having to deal with frictions from different protocols.\\n\\n\\\\[\u201dThe Kyber dynamic market maker model has brought high capital efficiency and lower trading losses to liquidity platforms. EPNS is excited about the opportunity to automate the missing link in the DMM model, messaging. Push notifications will help liquidity providers gain more control over their positions and further maximize returns\u201d, commented Harsh Rajat, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service.\\\\]\\n\\nLooking forward, we foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced for the Kyber Network in particular, and DeFi swap markets in general. Push Notifs on pricing, KBIs and other key data will be essential to enable future Kyber users to take advantage of dynamic market making and optimize returns. Thus, as more DeFi platforms adopt Kyber-style pools, we view decentralized push notifications as an important service that will support higher capital utilization in decentralized finance. Since KyberDMM is at the forefront of creating more efficient liquidity pools, we expect our partnership to yield many new useful notification services and features for the DeFi markets.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of the Kyber Network. DeFi users \u2014 who can easily integrate the EPNS protocol into a wallet \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service. Going forward, we also expect to work closely with Kyber users to create new messaging solutions to meet their evolving push notification needs.\\n\\nWe are pleased to be partnering with the Kyber Network and anticipate EPNS push notifications becoming an indispensable tool in decentralized swap markets.\\n\\n# About Kyber Network\\n\\nKyber Network aims to deliver a sustainable liquidity infrastructure for DeFi. As a liquidity hub, Kyber connects liquidity from various protocols and sources (e.g. KyberDMM) to provide the best token rates to takers such as Dapps, DEX aggregators, DeFi platforms, and traders.\\n\\nThrough Kyber, anyone can contribute or access liquidity, and developers can build innovative applications, including token swap services, decentralized payments, and financial Dapps \u2014 helping to build a world where any token is usable anywhere.\\n\\nKyber is powering more than 100 integrated projects and has facilitated over US$6 billion worth of transactions for thousands of users since its inception.\\n\\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/HdXWUb2pQM) | [Website](https://kyber.network/) | [Forum](https://gov.kyber.org/) | [Blog](https://blog.kyber.network/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kybernetwork/) | [](https://www.reddit.com/r/kybernetwork/) [KyberDMM](https://dmm.exchange/#/about)"},{"id":"epns-gitcoin-2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-gitcoin-2021","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-09-epns-gitcoin-2021/index.md","title":"EPNS \ud83d\udc95 Gitcoin","description":"EPNS \ud83d\udc95 Gitcoin","date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 9, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Epnsproject","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/epnsproject"},{"label":"Gitcoin","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/gitcoin"},{"label":"Open Source","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/open-source"}],"readingTime":1.3366666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-gitcoin-2021","title":"EPNS \ud83d\udc95 Gitcoin","description":"EPNS \ud83d\udc95 Gitcoin","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"With Gitcoin Grants Round 11 starting today, EPNS is proud to announce we will be sponsoring GR11 to continue supporting early projects in Web3.","tags":["Ethereum","Epnsproject","Gitcoin","Open Source"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EPNS Push Notifications to Support Kyber\u2019s Frictionless Liquidity Pools","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-push-notifications-to-support-kyber"},"nextItem":{"title":"EPNS Governance goes Live!

For the community, it\u2019s the introduction of the necessary toolkit for discussing and organizing the protocol\u2019s future.\\n\\nEPNS has grown exponentially since the launch of the [$PUSH token](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/announcing-the-epns-push-token-generation-event-4d1699e716f5) in April, particularly concerning community engagement. **Over 5,400 addresses** have already subscribed to EPNS channels, and currently, there are **over 3,600 on-chain token holders**.\\n\\nFollowing our Token Genesis, we implemented several [community incentivization](http://incentives.epns.io/) programs, including liquidity mining and staking initiatives. During this phase, we also launched the [$ROCKSTAR EPNS NFT](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf), while activating the $PUSH rewards mechanism to express gratitude to our early adopters.\\n\\nImplementing EPNS Governance marks the protocol\u2019s next milestone, as we gradually move towards complete decentralization of the decision-making process. In this first iteration of the governance mechanism, we will use Snapshot, which is an off-chain and gasless multi-governance client. Due to its Snapshot-based implementation, the voting mechanism shall be weighted based on the number of $PUSH tokens delegated to the voting address. Hereafter, any potential modifications to the protocol must pass through a proposal and voting process.\\n\\n# EPNS Governance Phase 0\\n\\nWhen EPNS Governance launches on September 16, the community will be able to vote and make proposals on the following topics:\\n\\n- **Grants Program:** allocating grants to teams, projects, and initiatives across the ecosystem that are helping build around the EPNS ecosystem. The grants funds will come from the $PUSH Community Allocation (see below \u2018PUSH Allocation\u2019).\\n- **Weekly Rockstar NFTs:** each week, one EPNS community member is airdropped an NFT based on their contributions to the ecosystem. Voting for the recipient will now be part of the governance process.\\\\*\\\\*\\n- **Meta-Governance:** token holders can pass and vote on measures affecting how EPNS governance evolves past phase 0.\\n\\nAs the protocol matures, EPNS Governance will further decentralize and include more categories giving the community more power over the protocol!\\n\\nProposals to go live from 16th September! [PUSH Delegatee Nominations](https://gov.epns.io/t/epns-push-delegatee-nominations/21) are open now.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*The governance process for Rockstar NFTs will follow a slightly accelerated process, to ensure community members are rewarded quickly! The process will skip the \u201cProposal\u201d portion, and go straight to Snapshot. Team Champions will nominate 4 Rockstars from the past week, and the $PUSH community will vote for their top choice in Snapshot. For more information about Team Champions and the governance process, see below.\\n\\n# Governance Roles\\n\\nThere are four main roles in EPNS Governance:\\n\\n- **PUSH Nominee:** Active community members who strongly support the vision of EPNS can nominate themselves to be a PUSH Nominee. $PUSH token holders can then choose to delegate their voting rights to any Push Nominee, who can vote on governance proposals through Snapshot. Nominations are now open \u2014 [see here](https://gov.epns.io/t/epns-delegatees-introduction/21).\\n- **PUSH Delegatee:** PUSH Delegatees are active members of the community who have at least 75,000 $PUSH delegated to them. They will be able to create proposals on Snapshot that are approved on the forum.\\n- **PUSH Holders:** $PUSH holders can delegate their voting power to anyone, including themselves. They can also delegate it to a PUSH Delegatee to ensure their views and thoughts are well represented. The PUSH Delegatee can be changed at any time\\\\*\\\\*.\\n- **PUSH Champions:** A key part of our decentralization is making sure the community feels empowered. PUSH Champions are active community members that provide support to the EPNS metagovernance in various ways. There are 3 categories of PUSH Champions.\\n\\n_Community Champions: Web3 leaders who support the visions of EPNS and are willing to educate and empower the community to carry out progressive decentralized governance._\\n\\n_Team Champions: EPNS team members who are dedicated to guide and assist the community to implement a fair governance procedure._\\n\\n_Elected Champions: Elected community members who are trusted with the duty to assist the community to carry out a smooth governance process during each stage of a proposal. More details about the elected champions including selection, election and incentives will be made available soon. Ideally, we will select the first batch by again floating a proposal so that people can join in. We will explore compensation opportunities for these champions._\\n\\n_Note: No rewards or incentives are in place for Community Champions and Team Champions for the time being. Incentives will only be available for Elected Champions of the community._\\n\\n**_\\\\*_ Users who don\u2019t hold $PUSH but are highly motivated to participate and partake in the future of the protocol. They are also able to play a role in the ecosystem with the only condition being lobbying a Delegatee to back them up at the final stage of the voting.**\\n\\n# Governance Process\\n\\n## 1\\\\. Proposal Phase \u2014 [gov.epns.io](http://gov.epns.io/)\\n\\n![First Image of EPNS Governance goes Live! Let\u2019s PUSH for Progressive Decentralized Governance](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nThis is the very start of the entire governance journey. For any proposal to be accepted and executed for EPNS Governance, the initial proposer needs to submit their proposal on the [Governance Proposal](https://gov.epns.io/c/governance-proposals/8) Forum with the rules mentioned below.\\n\\nNote: This is a Discourse-hosted forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before participating. Proposals on the forum must be submitted following a template.\\n\\n**How to submit a Draft Proposals**\\n\\n- Users need to [follow this template](<https://github.com/push-protocol/push-governance/blob/main/Push%20Improvement%20Proposals%20(PIP)/pip-draft-proposal-template.md>) and post a new proposal draft under [Governance Proposals](https://gov.epns.io/c/governance-proposals/8).\\n- PUSH Champions then check the submitted draft proposal to ensure it follows the [governance rules](<https://github.com/push-protocol/push-governance/blob/main/Push%20Improvement%20Proposals%20(PIP)/governance-rules.md>). Some proposals will be asked to resubmit based on the Champions\u2019 discretion.\\n- Draft proposals are then promoted to the [Governance Discussions](https://gov.epns.io/c/governance-discussions/5) section provided they meet the promotion criteria mentioned below.\\n\\n**Promotion Criteria**\\n\\nChampions will move the proposal from the Governance Proposals section to the Governance Discussion section if they meet the following criteria:\\n\\n- Must follow the [Draft Proposal Template](<https://github.com/push-protocol/push-governance/blob/main/Push%20Improvement%20Proposals%20(PIP)/pip-draft-proposal-template.md>)\\n- Must be submitted under [Governance Proposal](https://gov.epns.io/c/proposals-lobby/8) section\\n- Must be live for 5+ days\\n- Must have 5 Likes (minimum)\\n\\nNote: The rules of governance (meta-governance) are also the subject of governance and thus can be changed following the due process. The git repo and the forum will always reflect the latest rules as enforced and governed by the $PUSH token holders.\\n\\n## 2\\\\. Discussion Phase \u2014 [gov.epns.io](http://gov.epns.io/)\\n\\n![Second Image of EPNS Governance goes Live! Let\u2019s PUSH for Progressive Decentralized Governance](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nThe next step in the governance journey is discussion. Draft proposals from the Proposal phase that meet the promotion criteria are promoted to the [Governance Discussions Forum](https://gov.epns.io/c/governance-discussions/5) by a PUSH Champion.\\n\\nDraft proposals in this phase should initiate discussion. We expect and encourage the community to debate them and express approval or disapproval.\\n\\n**How to submit a Draft Proposals for Discussion**\\n\\n- Only Champions can push draft proposals once they have met the criteria to Governance Discussion.\\n- This section is intended to serve as the last step before submitting a proposal to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth).\\n- Proposals can be pushed through to this section once enough traction has been gained in the Governance Proposals section.\\n- From here, draft proposals become a formal proposal once promotion criteria is met and will subsequently be pushed to Snapshot [](https://epns.io/) for voting to commence.\\n- Only PUSH Delegatees (users who have 75k+ votes) (delegated or owned) can initiate the formal proposal. If the user doesn\u2019t have enough votes, then it\u2019s expected of the user to either find a Delegatee to submit their formal proposal or request a Champion to find one for them.\\n\\n**Promotion Criteria**\\n\\nA draft proposal becomes a formal proposal if the following criteria are met:\\n\\n- Must be live for 5+ days in the Governance Discussion category\\n- Proposal on Forum must receive at least 10 likes\\n- Proposal on Forum must have a minimum of 3 replies\\n\\nNote: The draft proposal promoted by PUSH Champions can deviate a bit from what started in the Governance Proposal section owing to the discussion and the spirit of the proposal. In the event of discrepancies between the draft proposal submitted in the Governance Proposal section and the Governance Discussion section, the proposal under the Governance Discussion section will prevail.\\n\\n## 3\\\\. Governance Phase \u2014 [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth)\\n\\n![Third Image of EPNS Governance goes Live! Let\u2019s PUSH for Progressive Decentralized Governance](./image-3.webp)\\n\\nOnce the proposal on the Governance Discussion section meets the promotion criteria, It\u2019s considered a formal proposal and requires formal voting which takes place on Snapshot. A formal proposal can be defeated or accepted as outlined by the rules below.\\n\\nVotes on Snapshot are weighted by the number of $PUSH delegated to the address used to vote. A minimum of 75,000 $PUSH tokens are required to create a proposal.\\n\\nNote: Only users who have 75k+ votes (delegated or owned) can initiate the formal proposal. If the user doesn\u2019t have enough votes, then it\u2019s expected of the user to either find a Delegatee to submit their formal proposal or request a Champion to find one for them.\\n\\nHere below is the flow for the first version of the governance process:\\n\\n![Fourth Image of EPNS Governance goes Live! Let\u2019s PUSH for Progressive Decentralized Governance](./image-4.webp)\\n\\n**How to submit a Formal Proposal on Snapshot**\\n\\nThe draft proposals that pass the promotion criteria of Discussion phase are termed as formal proposals as they would be sent for formal voting. The rules for submission of a formal proposal on snapshot are as follows:\\n\\n- Formal proposals need to be submitted to Snapshot and must be given at least 7 days for the community to vote on the proposal.\\n- PUSH Champions will be moderating the proposals on Snapshot by the [rules mentioned here](<https://github.com/push-protocol/push-governance/blob/main/Push%20Improvement%20Proposals%20(PIP)/governance-rules.md#a-proposal-is-created-on-snapshot>).\\n- Only the users or a PUSH Delegatee can submit the proposals on the snapshot.\\n- All proposals on Snapshot must give at least 7 days for the community to vote on the proposal.\\n\\n**Promotion Criteria**\\n\\n- The proposal needs to meet the Quorom for it to be considered valid. Quorum is defined as 4% of the [circulating supply of $PUSH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/) voting in the affirmative.\\n- If the Quorom is not achieved in 7 days for a proposal, then the proposal is considered as defeated.\\n\\n## **What is Quorum**\\n\\nFor a vote to pass on Snapshot, it must achieve a quorum of 4% of the [circulating supply of $PUSH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/) voting in the affirmative. The purpose of the quorum is to ensure that the approved proposals have adequate voter participation. This means that if a proposal that had a majority of votes affirmative but didn\u2019t achieve the necessary quorum, it won\u2019t be approved.\\n\\n# Governance Game Theory, Incentives and Rules\\n\\nPUSH Governance is designed keeping quality participation in mind and as a byproduct carries some incentives and penalties to keep the governance focused, active and be ever improving.\\n\\n**Incentives for users whose formal draft is accepted**\\n\\n- We believe that having incentives for the users whose draft proposal are accepted will greatly improve the quality of the proposal (and quantity as well \ud83d\ude05) as it\u2019s in the best interest of the user to submit a draft proposal that can go through the entire cycle and be formally accepted.\\n- For the same, we will be creating a draft proposal soon to ask the community for the incentives they want to keep to make it happen.\\n- To counteract the quantity of draft proposals by a user, we have introduced rules which limit the number of draft proposals that can be submitted by the user in different phases.\\n\\n**Rules for users creating a proposal draft (Proposal Phase)**\\n\\n- Each user at [https://gov.epns.io](https://gov.epns.io/) is only allowed to submit a proposal draft once every 7 days under the proposal phase. Tweaks in the proposal can still be allowed at the discretion of the PUSH Champions.\\n\\n**Rules for users creating a proposal draft (Snapshot Phase)**\\n\\n- Each user (or PUSH Delegatee) that has the required votes delegated (75k $PUSH) is only allowed to submit a valid formal proposal on Snapshot once every 7 days.\\n\\nNote: These rules fall under meta governance and thus can be changed by the voting process as defined above.\\n\\n# PUSH Allocation\\n\\nThe $PUSH Token plays an essential role as it is the native governance token for the EPNS protocol. $PUSH grants its owners voting rights over core functionalities of the protocol, in addition to revenue accrued as network fees.\\n\\nThe total token supply of $PUSH is 100,000,000 that is broken down into:\\n\\n- 53% for community allocation\\n- 3.5% for advisors\\n- 7% for the foundation\\n- 16% for founders and teams\\n- 20.5% for investors\\n\\n![Fifth Image of EPNS Governance goes Live!

Let\'s review all the happenings in the dev front this month.\\n\\n## More channels \ud83d\udcfa\\n\\nA lot of progress has been made on this front this month:\\n\\n- **Channels in development**: PoolTogether, Oasis.app, Ruler Protocol, and Snapshot.\\n- **Channels in QA**: bZx, B.Protocol, and TracerDAO.\\n\\n![First Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-1.gif)\\n\\n- **Channels in preparation for release**: UniswapV3 and YAM.\\n\\n![Second Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nWorking on these channels have not only helped us gain brilliant insights on what Web3 needs, but it has also helped us improve the tooling that we use and the developers need. This brings us to another key item that we have been working on:\\n\\n**Plug & play for Showrunners framework**: we are close to releasing an update to our framework and make it available to the dev community, so you can develop on your own channels in a simpler fashion.\\n\\n## **Setting up the EPNS Governance Infrastructure**\ud83c\udfaf\\n\\nThis task entails orchestrating several moving pieces, validating that all processes are sound and that all tooling required is validated before launch.\\n\\nWith this in mind \u2014 we are adding yet one more section to our incentives website, where community and stakeholders can delegate voting power to the the person that best represents their interests.\\n\\nWe also set up and validated our Governance Forum and Snapshot space. We as a team ran several rounds of validation to cover all scenarios for a successful launch.\\n\\n## EPIP \u2014 new payloads and voting from notifications\ud83e\udd16\\n\\nOur EPIP (**E**thereum **P**ush **I**mprovement **P**roposal) to add the capability of voting from a notification itself is currently in the works. We will be testing it and making sure it works as expected as soon as the first version is ready. We will share more details soon.\\n\\n## Mobile App and Browser extension improvements \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n![Third Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-3.webp)\\n\\nAside from working on performance improvements for both the Mobile App and the Chrome Browser extension, we are at the last stage of adding **Channel Discovery** to them**.**\\n\\nThis will allow users to quickly browse the existing collection of channels available from a list, and very soon even subscribe to them from here.\\n\\nFinally, a set of cosmetic changes are in the works for the Chrome Browser Extension (currently in Alpha) aiming to closely mimic our Mobile App.\\n\\n## Protocol, Mainnet, and PUSH Nodes \ud83d\udd0e\\n\\nWith our Smart Contracts auditing being the next milestone in our list, many efforts are coming together to ensure we are ready to hit Mainnet right after.\\n\\nTons of progress has been made on the **protocol optimization and channel settings** front. We are finalizing activities regarding Protocol segmentation and its corresponding test cases. We will be done by early September and ready for audit! \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nAt the same time, a big part of our focus is on researching and finding the best approach towards developing our PUSH Nodes. This plays an important role in the decentralization of the Protocol, and it enables yet one more alternative to have an active participation in it.\\n\\n# The more the merrier \u2014 Meet our new Frens! \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\n[**Aragon**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-partners-with-aragon-voice-to-power-unstoppable-decentralized-governance-56182b9d9aa0): through this collaboration we aim to keep everyone updated on the future of the protocol and the direction is heading.

With its decentralized crypto volatility index (CVI), it lets users capitalize on market fluctuations in either direction. Combine this with our decentralized push notifications that help users maximize their profits and we get a partnership to keep.\\n\\n# Better Opportunities, Better Engagement with Push Notifications\\n\\nCOTI\u2019s CVI, as mentioned before, is the first ever decentralized volatility index (CVI) inspired by the traditional stock market VIX. Users can profit from volatility by opening positions in expectation of fluctuations in either direction. The index has a value ranging from zero to 200 calculated by analyzing the implied volatility of cryptocurrency option prices together with analyzing the market\u2019s expectation of future volatility.\\n\\nUsers who believe the volatility is on the rise can open CVI positions and rake profits by selling their positions once the index rises. On the other hand, users who believe the volatility will remain low, can provide liquidity to the platform and benefit from fees paid by users who opened CVI positions.\\n\\nIn reference to this, users have to continuously keep an eye on third party communication channels like mail and Twitter to be able to fully capitalize on these fluctuations. Failure to do so might result in missed opportunities for users and poor engagement for the platform.\\n\\nThis is where EPNS push notification could be a significant addition. By providing timely updates, EPNS can reduce users\u2019 dependency on third-party media and ensure that they miss no opportunity.\\n\\n# What Does the Partnership Have in store\\n\\nThrough our partnership with CVI, we aim to build a robust communication medium that encourages user participation on the CVI protocol. Users can subscribe to receive timely notifications about the market situation, which include\\n\\n- Updates about unexpected changes in index value for all users.\\n- Updates about upcoming market events like Coinbase IPO, EIP 1559 that could affect the CVI.\\n- Updates to individual users about their margin positions on the platform if they approach liquidation threshold.\\n- Updates on arbitrage opportunities specifically for CVI arbitrageurs group.\\n\\nThese notifications can better help users anticipate where the market is going, pre-plan their strategies, and maximize their profits. We\u2019re pleased to be partnering with CVI on this project and are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of the Crypto Volatility Index.\\n\\nTo get more updates about EPNS and the exciting partnerships we form, stay tuned!\\n\\n# About COTI\\n\\nCOTI is a fully encompassing \u201cFinance on the blockchain\u201d ecosystem, specifically designed to meet the challenges of both centralized finance (fees, latency, global inclusion and risk) and Decentralized Finance DeFi (fees, clogging and complexity) by introducing a new type of DAG based base protocol and infrastructure that is scalable, fast, private, inclusive, low cost and is optimized for finance.\\n\\nStay in touch!

CVI is a protocol tracking the 30-day implied volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The index ranges between 0 and 200 and is produced based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which computes the implied volatility of cryptocurrency option prices together with analyzing the market\u2019s expectation of future volatility. Using the index, people can have the same insights of the market that people that look into traditional markets have using the VIX: understand the expected volatility of the market, develop trading strategies for short-term gains, and hedge their portfolio against price fluctuations.\\n\\nStay in touch!

Today, on Ethereum, we build digital communities without geographical boundaries, but as we build, it is becoming increasingly difficult to govern on-chain. The need for user-friendly governance tools and infrastructure has never been higher.\\n\\nAragon is building the governance infrastructure for Web3. Their plug-in modules are enabling the deployment of decentralized organizations with multiple governance models, gasless voting and conflict resolution. These empower communities to coordinate in a censorship resistant, permissionless way.\\n\\nWe at EPNS are glad to announce that we are working with Aragon to bring decentralized push notifications to users. For our pilot program with Aragon, we will integrate with Aragon Govern, Aragon Court and Aragon Client:\\n\\n**Create a notifications channel \u2014** governance related actions will trigger push notifications for every token holder. This will keep everyone updated on the future of the protocol and the direction it is heading:\\n\\n- Aragon Govern \u2014 token holders will be notified when transactions are scheduled, disputed and executed to ensure they are aware of everything the organization is doing.\\n- Aragon Court \u2014 Guardians will be notified when they are drafted, when their vote is required and when a dispute is settled.\\n- Aragon Client \u2014 token holders will be notified at every stage of the proposal lifecycle: when a proposal is made, when voting is required and when the outcome is executed, to encourage the community to actively participate in DAO governance.\\n\\n**Include custom governance Call to Actions** \u2014 Integrated Call to Action (CTA) for the receiver of the notification, to be able to vote or signal their preference with ease, right on the notifications interface.\\n\\nWe believe that integrating the communication infrastructure of Ethereum with key governance infrastructure will be vital for the future of governance and make it more user-friendly.\\n\\nBy working with the Aragon team we look forward to the opportunity to further refine our protocol\u2019s governance and use the best tools available to create robust governance mechanisms.\\n\\n### **About Aragon**\\n\\nAragon is building the future of decentralized governance for Web3 communities & organizations. Deploy a DAO, manage your community, resolve disputes and run enterprise-level votes, all within our open-source stack.\\n\\n[**Aragon Client**](https://client.aragon.org/) is a robust, full-service solution to create and manage decentralized organizations, trusted by the biggest names with billions of dollars under management.\\n\\n[**Aragon Govern**](https://govern.aragon.org/) is a pioneering framework for frictionless DAO governance with on-chain execution and plug-in dispute resolution.\\n\\n[**Aragon Voice**](https://voice.aragon.org/) is a permissionless dApp for DAO proposals & secure voting, compatible with any ERC20 token and completely free to use.\\n\\n[**Aragon Court**](https://court.aragon.org/) is a plug-in hub for Web3 arbitration that uses crypto-economic incentives for autonomous Guardians to rule on subjective disputes.\\n\\nAragon is trusted by over 1800 DAOs building Web3 communities and organizations.

But, to execute it well, it requires all network participants to come to a consensus about building, updating or abandoning certain rules and processes within the ecosystem.\\n\\nThis can be particularly challenging if there is no communication channel that brings all the participants together and keeps them updated about the changes being made. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve partnered with [Idle](https://idle.finance/) to deliver push notifications for their governance-related proposals and updates, building unprecedented levels of communication between the participants and the network.\\n\\n# How Can Idle Benefit from Push Notifications\\n\\nIdle is a blockchain-based rebalancing protocol that allows users to manage their digital asset allocation across third-party DeFi protocols. To adapt to the ever-changing trends in the crypto space while keeping the protocol decentralized and community-driven, Idle relies on its community to make governance proposals to update its protocol and processes.\\n\\nIn this context, whenever there are new proposals made to update the protocol or processes of Idle, stakeholders need to be notified about the voting process. The community too needs to be updated about the changes they can expect to unfold within the network. Without a proper communication channel, all these participants solely rely on Twitter, Telegram, and other third-party media for updates, which creates friction between them and the network, ultimately lowering participation rates.\\n\\nThis is where Idle\u2019s collaboration with EPNS could be game-changing: decentralized push notifications provide a reliable medium for the network to effectively deliver timely updates about network governance proposals to the community members.\\n\\n# What Does the Partnership Entail\\n\\nThrough our collaboration with Idle, we aim to build a reliable communication medium for stakeholders and the community to actively drive the protocol in a direction that best suits them. Users can now subscribe to receive push notifications pertaining to Idle\u2019s governance updates directly on their mobile devices. They can also expect:\\n\\n- Information about all the new governance proposals made on the Idle network.\\n- Updates about the voting process with actionable links that encourage participation for stakeholders.\\n- Updates on the decisions made through the voting process for the community.\\n- Information about implementing the changes and the future of the Idle network.\\n\\nAs Idle works towards rebalancing assets and maximizing interest rates and yield for its users, we are delighted to collaborate with them to ease their on-chain governance process and take another important step toward building a decentralized communication layer for web 3.0.\\n\\n# About Idle\\n\\nIdle is a decentralized rebalancing protocol that allows users to automatically and algorithmically manage their digital asset allocation among different third-party DeFi protocols. You can choose to maximize your interest rate returns through the Best-Yield strategy or minimize your risk exposure through the Risk-Adjusted strategy.\\n\\nIdle operates under a DAO governance model with the Idle Leagues formed as sub-DAOs. All individual contributors are voted in by the Idle token holders.

The Tracer DAO members have developed an innovative perpetual swaps platform by proposing and deciding on all major changes through shared governance. We are excited to announce our pilot program collaboration with Tracer DAO to provide decentralized push notifications to voting members to improve the DAO governance communication process.\\n\\n# **How Decentralized Notifications Can Empower Tracer DAO**\\n\\nTracer DAO is a derivative platform that provides a suite of risk management tools for both the digital and real world. One of the first financial contracts offered by Tracer DAO will be a perpetual swap contract, which is a widely traded contract that very cheaply enables people to go long or short on any underlying asset.\\n\\nAs part of Tracer DAO governance, all decisions are made by the DAO, discussed in open forums, and validated by votes. Anyone with TCR governance tokens has Tracer governance rights and can propose and vote on changes. Decisions range from introducing new perpetual swap pairs, deciding on critical contract variables, and engaging service providers.\\n\\nTracer DAO is ramping up quickly with the deployment of its Perpetual Swaps on scalable networks, integration with decentralized price feeds for permissionless derivatives, liquidation mechanisms, and partnerships with other service providers. As the platform and its services expand, governance rights holders are dealing with more governance proposals and related information. These voting members are highly dependent on notification services to deliver important information, including:\\n\\n- governance proposals\\n- discussion forums on proposals\\n- governance votes\\n- vote results\\n\\nUnfortunately, governance rights holders are currently reliant on email, Telegram, Discord and other social media channels to receive alerts. A push notification service would allow all governance members to receive and take timely action on governance proposals and votes while still protecting data privacy as smart contract users interact with internal and external data sources.\\n\\n> By leveraging EPNS, Tracer DAO members will be able to remain active in governing the protocol \u2014 ensuring that they do not miss a beat. Tracer DAO\u2019s vision of democratic decision-making that supports the evolution of the next financial system will greatly benefit from EPNS technology. **Patrick McNab, a contributor of Tracer DAO.**\\n\\n# **The EPNS Solution**\\n\\nThe EPNS decentralized push notification service sends timely notifications through a single source of communication, the investor\u2019s wallet. All notifications go directly to the user\u2019s wallet where they can take immediate action. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet. The partnership benefits to Tracer DAO members include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all data notifications directly to Tracer DAO user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and Tracer teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the various push notification needs of governance members.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different data notification requirements.\\n\\n# **How EPNS Will Support the Tracer DAO Governance Process**\\n\\nUnder this pilot program, EPNS is building a dedicated channel for Tracer (see our lightpaper for definitions of channels, services, and more). Tracer DAO members can subscribe to the Tracer channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets. Through collaboration with the Tracer team, we will gain insight into the push notification needs of Tracer DAO governors and what they want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nDecentralized notifications will allow proposals to be introduced and their pros and cons vetted among members in a more timely manner. Votes can be held without administrative delays and the results recorded directly on the digital ledger. Meanwhile, all users can continue to operate within the private, secure ecosystem of the Tracer protocol, while still keeping proposal content and voting results fully confidential and secure. Likewise, all push notifications will now be integrated into the Tracer ecosystem.\\n\\n> The DAO is the future of the enterprise. With the rules programmed into a smart contract, decisions can be made and results broadcast instantaneously. We believe decentralized push notifications are essential to the efficiency of the distributed governance process,\u201d commented **Harsh Rajat, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service**.\\n\\nLooking forward, we foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced within Tracer in particular, and DAO governance processes in general. Participation in network governance has been hindered by fragmented and slow discussion and voting channels, consuming the time of governance participants. Push notifications will be essential to lowering these frictions and building powerful and user centric tooling that quickly and easily alerts participants of important proposals and votes that will impact the DAO. Thus, we view decentralized push notifications as an important service that will place decentralized notifications at the core of the governance process.\\n\\nSince Tracer is at the forefront of giving full responsibility to manage a DeFi platform to the distributed governance ecosystem, we expect our partnership to yield many new useful notification services and features for DAOs.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of the Tracer DAO. Governance members \u2014 who can easily integrate the EPNS protocol into a wallet \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service. Going forward, we also expect to work closely with Tracer governance members to create new messaging solutions to meet their evolving push notification needs.\\n\\nWe are pleased to be partnering with Tracer and anticipate EPNS push notifications becoming an indispensable tool in DAO-run decentralized financial services.\\n\\n# **About Tracer**\\n\\nTracer is an open-source, smart contract protocol for derivatives. The Tracer Factory is a smart contract that can be used to host, modify and deploy censorship resistant financial contracts such as perpetual swaps. Tracer\u2019s Perpetual Swaps are fully decentralised and highly capital efficient. Key characteristics include market-specific insurance, permissionless market deployment, and risk-free liquidations. Once deployed anybody with an internet connection will gain access to Tracer\u2019s highly secure markets.\\n\\n[Website](https://tracer.finance/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TracerDAO) | [Discourse](https://discourse.tracer.finance/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/tracer-protocol) | [Whitepapers](https://tracer.finance/learn/) | [Blog](https://tracer.finance/radar/)"},{"id":"ama-with-b.protocol","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/ama-with-b.protocol","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-09-ama-with-b.protocol/index.md","title":"AMA with B.

Welcome Eitan Katchka @Ekatch, Head of Ecosystem Development, B.Protocol to the EPNS Community! It is a pleasure to have you with us today for an exciting AMA session. \ud83e\udd29\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Hey all!\\n\\n**JAI**: @Ekatch, Before we start could you please introduce yourself and go over your background so everyone in here gets to know you better?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: So first of all thanks Jai for having me here on the EPNS channel for this AMA.\\n\\nMy name is Eitan Katchka and I\u2019m leading the ecosystem development at B.Protocol.\\n\\nBefore I fell down the rabbit hole of crypto, I was leading large scale community-based projects in Israel, where I live.\\n\\nI started my crypto journey in early 2014 as one of the co-founders of LaZooz, a carpooling dApp that we built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Vitalik was even one of our advisors back then. It was one of the first DAOs, even before the technology was there to support it. Was exciting times (and still is) but we were way too early.\\n\\nThen I was working with Toyota Research Institute on a PoC for a mobility service on Ethereum. It was early 2017 and that\u2019s when I first met Yaron Velner who is the founder of B.Protocol.\\n\\nThen Yaron went on to become Kyber Network\u2019s first CTO and we met again in mid-2020 when I joined B.Protocol to lead the ecosystem development of the project.\\n\\nAs for B.Protocol -\\n\\nB.Protocol is the Backstop liquidity protocol for DeFi, making liquidations more efficient. We will cover why this is crucial for scaling the DeFi ecosystem during this chat I believe.\\n\\nHope it\u2019s enough for now\u2026 ;)\\n\\n**JAI**: 2014 wow \ud83d\ude32\\n\\nImpressive stuff @Ekatch!!\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Just feeling like a dinosaur \u2026\\n\\nThis ecosystem develops so fast you know.\\n\\n**JAI**: Absolutely and I am sure, community is looking forward to it as well.\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: That\u2019s true and that\u2019s the beauty of it :D\\n\\n**JAI**: Please when you\u2019re done answering any question, you can say \u201c**DONE**\u201d @Ekatch.\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Sure.\\n\\n**JAI**: Let\u2019s move to the next segment of our AMA Session.\\n\\nI hope you\u2019re ready @Ekatch? I will be asking some questions. \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n> **Q1. Can you briefly tell our community about B.Protocol\u2019s mission and vision and why it was launched?**\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Sure.\\n\\nB.Protocol is the Backstop liquidity protocol for DeFi lending platforms.\\n\\nThe project\u2019s main goal is to offer a strong backstop for the DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nA backstop is a well-known solution in CeFi and Tradfi but is still unknown and un-used in DeFi, as we are all still early and the ecosystem is still being built. B.Protocol is doing the needed adjustments to provide a decentralized backstop which is suited for DeFi.\\n\\nA quick take on Backstop -\\n\\nHaving a backstop, e.g. dedicated liquidity for liquidations, enables smooth and immediate execution of liquidations of unsafe vaults and positions \u2014 those who crossed the collateralization ratio/factor as it was determined by the lending platform they are using. In simple words, it means that the funds a user has deposited as collateral are no longer sufficient to keep the debt he or she has taken. If these unsafe vaults/positions are not being liquidated, they cast a real threat for the platform to become insolvent \u2014 and in DeFi it means for the users who have lent the tokens to not be able to withdraw their funds.\\n\\n**JAI**: This sounds interesting \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Liquidations are one of the growth engines for DeFi. And a better liquidation system is one of the key missing elements for DeFi lending platforms and margin trading systems at the moment in DeFi. It will unleash better capital efficiency for their users \u2014 Higher leverage and better collateralization factors/ratios.\\n\\nCompared to CeFi systems like Binance, ByBit etc, which offer x100 to users capital, DeFi is still way behind with most platforms offer x3-x5 leverage (collateral ratios/factors of 130\u2013150%/66\u201375% depending on how the platforms calculate this).\\n\\n**JAI**: Great to know. \ud83d\udd25\\n\\nI completely agree with you!\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: So, B.Protocol v1 was launched in October 2020 and has mainnet integrations with MakerDAO and Compound.\\n\\nAnd yesterday we launched our first v2 integration with Liquity (LUSD), which offers passive APY on LUSD of about ~20% currently.\\n\\nOh, and last thing for now \u2014\\n\\nB.Protocol is governed by $BPRO token holders.\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**JAI**: Amazing! Let\u2019s move onto the next Question.\\n\\n> **Q2. Can you please shed light on the major milestones B.Protocol has achieved so far and what can we expect from you guys in the future?**\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Sure.\\n\\nAs I mentioned we launched in Oct 2020 and have 3 integrations live on Ethereum mainnet \u2014 MakerDAO, Compound and Liquity.\\n\\nLiquity (LUSD/LQTY) is the first integration using B.Protocol v2 which enables liquidations via our novel Backstop AMM (B.AMM) design.\\n\\nUsers can try it here \u2014 [https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity](https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity)\\n\\nor read more about it here \u2014 [https://twitter.com/bprotocoleth/status/1422476042678251526?s=20](https://twitter.com/bprotocoleth/status/1422476042678251526?s=20)\\n\\n(I hope the links are ok here\u2026)\\n\\n[app.bprotocol.org](http://app.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\nB.Protocol\\n\\nThe decentralized backstop liquidity protocol.\\n\\nBesides that, since we launched we have integrated with a few aggregators and protocols such as \u2014\\n\\n**JAI**: Absolutely :D\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Zapper, Zerion, Furucombo, DeFi Saver, DeFi Pulse, DeFi Llama and DeBank. And have insurance covered by Nsure Network, and a Bug Bounty program run by Immunefi.\\n\\nYou can find most of it in our new Docs page \u2014 [https://docs.bprotocol.org/](https://docs.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\n[docs.bprotocol.org](http://docs.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\nIntro to B.Protocol\\n\\nDeFi\u2019 Backstop Liquidity Protocol\\n\\nPickle Finance has also integrated into our Liquity integration to offer compounding yields on LUSD and LQTY. You should check it out on their Jar page\u2026\\n\\nAnd just a few days ago our proposal to the Instadapp community has passed so users could soon use B.Protocol also with Instadapp\u2019s DSA.\\n\\n**AND now of course we also have EPNS coming!!!**\\n\\nSo the ecosystem around B.Protocol is growing.\\n\\nWe already have the next lending platform to integrate with our v2 \u2014 but this is still not officially announced so you will have to wait a bit more (but not too long\u2026 ;) )\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**JAI**: That\u2019s great! Let\u2019s move onto the next question.\\n\\n> **Q3. Can you tell us a little bit about how your experience has been in building B.Protocol and what are the advantages B.Protocol has over similar projects?**\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Sure.\\n\\nIt\u2019s been intense as the ecosystem grows so rapidly and so many new projects and protocols are coming out all the time, but it\u2019s mainly lots of fun to take an active role in shaping this ecosystem and collaborating and integrating with so many other \u201cmoney lego\u201d protocols.\\n\\nThe main advantage of B.Protocol is making the DeFi ecosystem stronger and more resilient \u2014 and users who use B.Protocol make sure the lending platform they are using can handle liquidations also during sharp declines in the market.\\n\\nBut DeFi also comes with its incentives built in\u2026.\\n\\nIn B.Protocol v1 which is our integrations with Maker and Compound users actually share the liquidation proceeds made by the Backstop liquidators. As our v1 users are giving the protocol\u2019s liquidators a priority in the liquidation process, they get in return 35\u201350% of the liquidators proceeds as the liquidators don\u2019t need to compete with other liquidators and to pay high gas fees to miners (aka \u201cgas wars\u201d) in order to win the liquidation tx.\\n\\nIn v2, e.g. the integration with Liquity, users can get a PASSIVE 15\u201320% APY (currently) on their LUSD deposits in the Stability Pool. This is quite high for stablecoins.\\n\\nThis is possible thanks to the automated rebalancing of Liquity Stability Pool after liquidations are happening.\\n\\nUsers can also use Pickle.finance who has integrated with B.Protocol as well. In that case, users will also enjoy automated staking of LQTY, the reward token of Liquity, using the Pickle Jars for compounding yield.\\n\\nAlso, the community is currently discussing the next Liquidity Mining details, and some offers on the forum include rewards for new and existing users, as well as staking options for BPRO. So there is alot going on regarding advantages\u2026\\n\\nOne last thing maybe \u2014 For Maker and Compound the Import process to move from the lending platforms to B.Protocol is a **1-click process.**\\n\\nOnce you get connected with your MetaMask with the same account you are using for the original platform \u2014 an Import button pops up and all you need to do is to approve it on your MetaMask to get your funds move to be managed on B.Protocol (including any debt that you have of course).\\n\\nSo basically, if you are a user of Compound, Maker or Liquity, which are the platforms we support today, you have no real reason why NOT to use B.Protocol.\\n\\nDone \u2026\\n\\n**JAI**: \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: One clarification maybe \u2014 this is not relevant for Liquity. There users need to just withdraw their LUSD and deposit it via B.Protocol\\n\\nNow really done\u2026 ;)\\n\\n**JAI**: Thanks for the clarification! \u2708\ufe0f\\n\\nHere is the next Question :D\\n\\n> **Q4. EPNS is building a dedicated channel for B.Protocol which will allow your users to subscribe to the B.Protocol channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets.**\\n>\\n> **Can you tell us how you envision EPNS notifications playing an important role to help improve the experience for your current users, and attracting more new users?**\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: In the \u201cnon-crypto\u201d world we are so used to getting notified on our \u201cregular\u201d apps \u2014 Telegram, Whatsapp, Twitter, and definitely any finance application we are using. Even my bank app sends me notifications.\\n\\nBut in DeFi this is still a missing piece and it\u2019s a huge hurdle when on-boarding users, mainly those new to DeFi and crypto.\\n\\nI believe getting notifications from apps where you manage your money, definitely in such a volatile market such as DeFi, is a must. And it will improve the user experience significantly.\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what this collaboration is all about!!\\n\\nI think what users of lending platforms (which are our users as well) are mostly interested in, is the safety of their funds in the Vault. And one of the biggest fears for any lending platform user is to get liquidated\u2026\\n\\nSo the first notification service we will work on is letting users get notified whenever their funds are getting close to the liquidation threshold. This will enable them to manage their position in time and to try and save it.\\n\\nI believe this can bring a lot of added value to our users, and another great reason for some new users to move their funds to be managed on B.Protocol (besides all the other benefits\u2026)\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**JAI**: EPNS \ud83e\udd1d B.Protocol\\n\\nLet\u2019s move onto the last Question of this segment.\\n\\n> **Q5. Can you tell us how you plan to further collaborate with EPNS and what is your long-term vision for our project which will help to make us stronger and better in the DeFi space?**\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: As we start with the above pilot use case, I believe more and more use cases will come up as for where notifications are mostly needed in our system.\\n\\nAnd of course our community of users will probably have the best ideas for that once they get to taste the benefits.\\n\\nAs B.Protocol gets integrated with more and more lending platforms, its notification system with EPNS might be used by users across DeFi, helping to share the vision of EPNS with more parts of the entire DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nI think there is a lot of potential for this collaboration\\n\\nDone!\\n\\n**JAI**: Brilliant, Thank you for your answers @Ekatch! We will now move to the last round which is a Live Q/A session.\\n\\nDear Community, get ready to shoot all your Questions! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n**I will UNMUTE the group soon and @Ekatch will pick and answer as many questions as possible but only participants with the BEST questions will be selected as winners at the end of AMA.**\\n\\nAre you all ready?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: GIF\\n\\n**JAI**: 1\u2026 GO!! GO!!\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Let\u2019s start with this one.\\n\\n**\u26e9**: Community support is one of the biggest aspects of a project\u2019s success. Most projects have programs that interact with their users. Do you have any special plans to attract and expand the community and improve the user experience?\\n\\n**JAI**: Our chat is on MUTE again and here you go, we have got the last set of Questions from community members.\\n\\nI now request @Ekatch to pick and answer the BEST Questions. This AMA is on fire. \ud83d\udd25\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: We are putting a lot of efforts on our community. Our Discord and forum are the places to get in touch with the team as well as with other B.Protocol members.\\n\\nThe team has no voting power in the governance \u2014 so B.Protocol is a real \u201cOwned by the gov\u201d project.\\n\\nWe are just building a Growth Squad which is built from members of the community.\\n\\n**KECIA HOUGHTON**: How revenue is generated to sustain the project, and what plans do you have to attract more users in the future?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: In v1 (currently Maker and Compound integrations) the revenues are coming from sharing the liquidation proceeds with the Backstop liquidators.\\n\\nIn v2 there are fees for the rebalancing of Liquity\u2019s Stability Pool and the DAO controls that switch to set the fees.\\n\\n**SUPERSTAR**: What are the steps to become a part of your community, and start getting revenues? Where do we buy, where do we sign up? This looks like an amazing project!\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: You can just head over to app.bprotocol.org and start using the protocol. If you are a Maker or Compound user you can just Import your existing account with 1-click as I mentioned.\\n\\nTo buy BPRO you can look at the regular DEXs \u2014 Uniswap v2 has some liquidity (though not alot\u2026)\\n\\n**NATHANIAL MIRANDA**: Q. I\u2019m a developer, and I\u2019m interested in contributing to B.Protocol alongside earning, Do you have any Bug Bounty to check for vulnerabilities ?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Yes there is!\\n\\nYou can head over to Immunefi for the details\\n\\n[https://immunefi.com/bounty/bprotocol/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/bprotocol/)\\n\\nImmunefi\\n\\nVProtocol Bug Bounties | Immunefi\\n\\nFind bugs and vulnerabilities on B.Protocol and get paid up to $100,000.\\n\\nWe also have some open tasks on Gitcoin from time to time.\\n\\nThe bug bounty has up to $100k in bounties (for critical ones\u2026)\\n\\n**LFC BOY**: Can $BPRO holders have the right to submit proposal and participate in the governance of the project? What kind of project decision can they vote on?\\n\\n@Ekatch\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: There is no limit currently for submitting proposals for vote.\\n\\nMost of the governance is held off-chain to enable more token holders to participate, via Snapshot.\\n\\nToken holders vote on Liquidity Mining rewards as on any allocation of funds from the DAO reserve. It will also vote on future fees etc.\\n\\n**LORI ESPINAL**: What is the utility of your native token B Protocol ? Also, What special features do you have or plan to implement that keeps you ahead of your competitors?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: BPRO is a purely Governance token. There are discussions in B.Protocol forum about future revenue sharing models and other mechanisms that can be put in place to add other uses to the token.\\n\\n**VOID**: Good projects always have an experienced team behind them. Can you tell us something about your team and their experience in the market?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: I\u2019ll take that as a compliment and as a question\u2026 ;)\\n\\nI have introduced myself at the beginning of the AMA so you can search for that\u2026\\n\\nThe founder and lead developer of B.Protocol, Yaron Velner, is the ex-CTO of Kyber Network which is one of the leading protocols in DeFi since 2017 (even before it was called DeFi\u2026).\\n\\nYaron holds a PhD in Computer Science from the Tel Aviv University in Israel and was also one of the co-designers of the WBTC protocol.\\n\\nSo I think you can definitely say B.Protocol is in good and experienced hands\u2026\\n\\n**LIVELY**: Can you explain how is your Tokenomics Distribution? How many tokens will be minted ? And how many tokens will be locked by the team??\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: It is all described in our Docs (docs.bprotocol.org)\\n\\nBut in short -\\n\\nduring the first 4 years since we launched (Oct 2020) 10m BPRO will be minted.\\n\\nThe 33% is going to the Devs. no VCs allocation were made.\\n\\n1m BPRO were distributed to early users of the protocol, who used it during the first 6 months.\\n\\n250k BPRO went to the first LM program that ran for 3 months.\\n\\nThe rest is in the hands of the DAO in the Reserve\\n\\nThis is taking some time to answer\u2026\\n\\nHold on\u2026\\n\\n2 more to go\u2026\\n\\n**JOHNNY METZ**: I would like to know if you\u2019ve completed any security audits? What measures have been taken to protect B.Protocol community from it?\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: Yes.\\n\\nB.Protocol was audited by Solidified both for its Maker and Compound integration.\\n\\nThe Liquity integration was also audited by a separate group of auditors. I can share links later but again \u2014 it is all in the Docs (docs.bprotocol.org)\\n\\nLAST ONE\u2026.\\n\\n**MURDOCK**: From where you get the project name? What does it means to you? And why did you choose this name for your project? What is your mission and vision to build this project? What do you want to achieve in the future????\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**: A good clarification is in place!\\n\\nB. stands for Backstop.\\n\\nSo its Backstop Protocol\\n\\nSome think we should have sticked with Backstop\u2026 but B.Protocol became the name. At least until we rebrand like all the big projects do\u2026 ;)\\n\\nAs for the vision and future plans I have shared in the AMA so you can have a look above\u2026\\n\\nThanks everyone for an amazing AMA!!!\\n\\n**JAI**: @Ekatch can you drop Social Media Channel Links of B.Protocol\\n\\nThat would be awesome!\\n\\n**EITAN KATCHKA**:\\n\\nHere is where you can find everything about B.Protocol\\n\\nWebsite \u2014 [https://www.bprotocol.org/](https://www.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\nDiscord \u2014 [https://discord.com/invite/bJ4guuw](https://discord.com/invite/bJ4guuw)\\n\\nTwitter \u2014 [https://twitter.com/bprotocoleth](https://twitter.com/bprotocoleth)\\n\\nReddit \u2014 [https://www.reddit.com/r/bprotocol/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bprotocol/)\\n\\nForum \u2014 [https://forum.bprotocol.org/](https://forum.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\nDocs \u2014 [https://docs.bprotocol.org/](https://docs.bprotocol.org/)\\n\\nLatest Liquity integration \u2014 [https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity](https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity)\\n\\n**JAI**: Thank you for your insightful answers, @Ekatch.

Awesome to be here \ud83d\udc4b Thank you for hosting us.\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Please keep quiet for the first section if you want to win prizes guys!\\n\\n**HARSH**: Hey Guys! Excited to be here\ud83c\udf60\u2764\ufe0f\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Any talkers will NOT win the prize! Rule 1 \ud83d\ude04\\n\\nWelcome Richa and Harsh! How are you guys? Would you like to introduce yourselves and EPNS?\\n\\n**RICHA**: Sure! I\u2019m co-founder at Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) and mainly focus on the Marketing and Growth. \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n**HARSH**: Hey Everyone! I am Harsh, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service. Some background about me. I love all things tech and have as a byproduct gathered 11+ years of experience in dabbling across various spectrums of tech and design in almost all popular fields (mobile, web services, SAAS and of course Blockchain).\\n\\n> **ZETALEAK**: Amazing guys! Why did you guys launch EPNS and what problem does it seek to solve?\\n\\n**HARSH**: Ethereum Push Notifications Service aka EPNS is communication middleware for blockchain that enables any smart contracts, dApps or Web3 service to send notifications to wallet addresses.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*The idea in TLDR;\\\\*\\\\* Taking a note from Apple and Google Notifications Middleware, which we all virtually use, we realized that services need a standard, open communication layer protocol just like them to enable UX and services finally being able to reach users via decentralized notifications tied to their crypto wallets.\\n\\nHere is a cool video teaser we created to share a glimpse of the notifications\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwwnlmUpRsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwwnlmUpRsk)\\n\\nFor instance, Liquidation on AAVE, Compound or any DeFi, DAO Governance proposal (Yam!), or ENS/DEX orders. Each of these are a reality right now but no solution exists to address them and the problem will only worsen as more services come to Web3.\\n\\n> **ZETALEAK**: Very cool!! Can you talk about the milestones in your roadmap and what\u2019s next for EPNS?\\n\\n**RICHA**: Just to share a bit about our journey \ud83d\ude4f so far: We have had an awesome journey! Ideation and loads of research were taken to \\\\*\\\\*Ethereum Foundation\\\\*\\\\* -> \\\\*\\\\*EthGlobal HackMoney 2020\\\\*\\\\* where we build POC -> selected for \\\\*\\\\*IDEO PVD\\\\*\\\\* -> selected for \\\\*\\\\*Gitcoin Kernel fellowship \\\\*\\\\*and came out as top 20 projects! -> entered \\\\*\\\\*Gitcoin Grant round 7 (top 5 projects / 210+ contributors) \\\\*\\\\*which led us to raise our seed round.\\n\\nAlso, extremely grateful to be backed by 35+ top VCs and Web3 leaders including: Balaji Srinivasan, Binance Labs, True Ventures, LD Capital, Sandeep (Polygon), Mariano Conti, Anthony Sassano (EthHub /TheDailyGwei), DeFiDad, Preethi Kasireddy among several more awesome peeps.\\n\\n**HARSH**: Haha, Richa beat me to it, but in short: We have come a long way from Raise -> POC -> Live notifications (coming from mainnet but going through our Ropsten protocol) -> launching channel discovery on app.epns.io -> launching yield farming for community.\\n\\nBut that\u2019s just the start and that\u2019s the coolest part. We are looking at Launching Governance in just under two weeks -> Mainnet in Q3 -> Push Nodes and Staking in Q4.\\n\\n**RICHA**: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/soaring-through-the-sky-with-epns-pilot-programs-4d02f09a6a8](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/soaring-through-the-sky-with-epns-pilot-programs-4d02f09a6a8)\\n\\n**HARSH**: Alpha Drop\\n\\n> **ZETALEAK**: Woah! What a journey! And you guys are just getting started. \ud83d\ude80\\n>\\n> Can you touch upon the EPNS ecosystem briefly and how everything works?\\n\\n**HARSH**: Thanks Guys!\\n\\nThe way EPNS works in on two levels:\\n\\n\\\\- Sending Notifications (Which is done through either interacting with our middleware smart contract (EPNS Communicator/or sending notification payload directly to push nodes).\\n\\n\\\\- Receiving Notifications and Dispatching (this forms the open communication network ) which any crypto wallet can listen for and show it on their frontend.\\n\\nCurrently, these push nodes are sending notifs to our mobile apps and our extension but yes, as I mentioned the vision is that you can open Metamask and bam! the notifications will be right there.\\n\\nAs for the logic of notifications, we took the stance that services are sending notifications to users and they should decide the logic, whether on-chain or off-chain. Of course, to increase network effect, we selected few elite projects (Like Yam!) for whom we will build this logic out as well.\\n\\n**HARSH**: We lovingly call them Frens of EPNS! \ud83d\udc93\\n\\n**RICHA**:\\n![First Image of AMA with EPNS at Yam Finance](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n> **ZETALEAK**: Thanks for sharing. EPNS is leading the charge on this vital piece of infrastructure!\\n>\\n> Final question and then we will open this channel for community questions!\\n>\\n> What is your long-term vision for the EPNS project?\\n\\n**HARSH**: Easy, Become the Communication Layer for Ethereum, L2s and then finally for other blockchains as well! We are lucky to be in the right place at the right time to create this which hopefully will make the Web3 even easier to embrace and hop on!\\n\\n**RICHA**: Harsh\u2019s answers are getting too short. Here\u2019s our Roadmap \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n![Second Image of AMA with EPNS at Yam Finance](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Love the big vision guys! I\u2019m really excited that Yam DAO is joining you guys on this journey.\\n\\nWe can\u2019t wait to get set up using the EPNS service to help users of our Yam Synths platform [https://synths.yam.xyz/](https://synths.yam.xyz/)\\n\\nDon\u2019t forget you can earn yield by minting and LPing synths guys \ud83d\ude42\\n\\nAlso everyone, reminder we have a POAP for all attendees!\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/yamfinance/status/1419681062016327686?s=21](https://twitter.com/yamfinance/status/1419681062016327686?s=21)\\n\\nIf you like POAPs and NFTs make sure to stick around as we regularly do giveaways. \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\n**RICHA**: [https://tenor.com/view/wow-wow-cat-cat-cat-wow-cattitude-wow-gif-17576200](https://tenor.com/view/wow-wow-cat-cat-cat-wow-cattitude-wow-gif-17576200)\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: So that concludes the panel questions! Thank you so much Richa and Harsh !\\n\\nI will now open up for community questions!\\n\\nDon\u2019t forget, $200 PUSH is up for grabs for the best questions!\\n\\n**RICHA**: Let\u2019s do this guys!!\\n\\n**HARSH**: This was really cool, Thanks for having us. Going to get some Yield for Yam now!\\n\\nPS: We also have our yield program which users can join to earn incase they own $PUSH: [https://incentives.epns.io](https://incentives.epns.io)\\n\\nPS: We love our community and have $ROCKSTAR NFTs for one user every week: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf)\\n\\nPS: We love to have you guys join our Push community as well (https://t.me/epnsproject | [https://twitter.com/epnsproject](https://twitter.com/epnsproject) | [https://epns.io)](https://epns.io))\\n\\n> **DUODUOLIU**: Does the community empower NFTs? Like community voting, governance, etc.? Or just a JPG image?\\n\\n**HARSH**: Woah, yes, NFT contains 2400 $PUSH, and yes, it will empower voting, governance, etc as well.\\n\\n**DUODUOLIU**: Very good.\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n> **88888888**: Will early supporters have pre-emption rights or community participants have the opportunity to receive free cryptocurrency.\\n\\n**HARSH**: Early supporters get cool things like deciding the vision of the project, getting higher APRs and a lot of cool stuff though free cryptocurrency might not be one of the benefits.\\n\\n> **BLACKHORSE**: Harsh How about the future to implement this to other blockchains as well?\\n\\n**HARSH**: We already starting laying the ground work on it! And yes, plan is to make it come to all smart blockchains, even non-EVM ones, though governance will always stay on Ethereum.\\n\\n**OFFICE**: How can get this NFT?\\n\\n**HARSH**: Start here: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf)\\n\\n**88888888**: It\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s cool, and I\u2019m looking forward to it now, and it feels good.\\n\\n**BLACKHORSE**: Sound good. Estimated timeline to launch first version for non-ethereums?\\n\\n> **SAKURALU**: $Will there be more empowerment and application scenarios for $PUSH in the future?\\n\\n**HARSH**: Yes, Push Nodes will need staking (just like Eth2.0) + Since we are a middleware, the token holders decide the fee split (when it\u2019s enabled) among themselves and other crypto wallets integrating the protocol + Incentives and Yield farming (https://incentives.epns.io) + Governance\\n\\n> **ETHFLY**: When does the project plan to issue its own digital currency.\\n\\n**HARSH**: Already done, it\u2019s called $PUSH.\\n\\n**SAKURALU**: Cool. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\\n\\n> **OFFICE**: How can get this NFT?\\n\\n**RICHA**: Teaser of our Weekly Community ROCKSTAR NFT along with the blog link on how to participate: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf)\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1417168210718244868](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1417168210718244868)\\n\\n> **VOLWORLD**: Harsh ROSS What kind of cooperation do YAM and EPNS plan in the future?\\n\\n**HARSH**: We are building notifications for YAM, which means you as a user will soon start receiving about various events starting from liquidation risks, read more: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/bringing-power-of-web3notif-to-the-awesome-yam-community-95d8a39ed86c](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/bringing-power-of-web3notif-to-the-awesome-yam-community-95d8a39ed86c)\\n\\n> **HANJIANG**: Is EPNS ready to launch an app?\\n\\n**HARSH**: Already live on iOS, Android and Chrome. Checkout [https://app.epns.io](https://app.epns.io)\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: \u23f0 3 minutes remaining to ask your questions, get them in quick!\\n\\n**BLACKHORSE**: I think it is not best for secure, How about your think?\\n\\n**HARSH**: It is secure. We support encrypted notifications as well. \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n> **BLACKHORSE**: Harsh, It is safe for Hacking?\\n\\n**HARSH**: Yes, completely safe, read about the technical overview here: [https://whitepaper.epns.io](https://whitepaper.epns.io)\\n\\n> **88888888**: Is there too little NTFs? After 48 are sent, we only have one a week to fight for. It\u2019s too little. Could you please send more?\\n\\n**HARSH**: There are still 40+ NFTs up for grabs.\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Ok guys time is up!!\\n\\n**HARSH**: 100 in total. Here\u2019s a preview of one of them.\\n\\n> **VOLWORLD**: As far as I know, will YAM\u2019s synths products be applied to? But if the user does not start Discord, are there other types of push methods, such as silent push of mobile APP!\\n\\n**HARSH**: Yes, we focus on mobile and desktop notifications first :). Check [https://epns.io](https://epns.io) or [https://app.epns.io](https://app.epns.io) for more info.\\n\\n> **ROSS**: How do you guys feel about a multi-chain world and what kind of additional work will it take to make EPNS work for more than just Ethereum?\\n\\n**HARSH**: We already started multi-chain preps and laying foundation. Technically, we have two middleware contracts (EPNSCore and EPNSCommunicator), EPNSCore handles governance and will be on Ethereum while EPNSCommunicator will be deployed to multiple chains. The Push Nodes will listen to EPNSCommunicator and validate it with EPNSCore protocol essentially enabling multichain, even non-EVM ones. \ud83d\ude31\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Wow, thank you so much for answering Harsh and Richa ! It\u2019s been a real pleasure having you guys here!\\n\\nThat now concludes the event! Thanks everyone!\\n\\nDon\u2019t forget to claim your FREE POAP!\\n\\nTo get it you need to message the @POAP-BOT the password \u2018epnsama\u2019.\\n\\n**RICHA**: Thanks Zetaleak for hosting us. This was really fun and thanks.\\n\\nAwesome YAM peeps for all the wonderful questions. Finally, if you\u2019d like to know more about what we are building, please join:\\n\\n[https://t.me/epnsproject](https://t.me/epnsproject)\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/epnsproject](https://twitter.com/epnsproject)\\n\\nIncentives portal: [https://incentives.epns.io](https://incentives.epns.io)\\n\\nVisit us: [epns.io](http://epns.io)\\n\\n**HARSH**: Thanks for having us guys!! We love Yam and this was quite fun for us, hope it was the same for you guys as well. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Absolutely! It was amazing having you here. Here\u2019s to a long future building together. \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n**BLACKHORSE**: Security weaknesses: Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with $PUSH and/or the EPNS protocol in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company, the Distributor or their respective affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of $PUSH and/or the EPNS protocol, which could negatively affect $PUSH and/or the EPNS protocol. Further, the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable and advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to $PUSH and/or the EPNS protocol by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.\\n\\n**HARSH**: Love the thoroughness. As with any network, we need to design a proper game theory around it. Though some points are already covered:\\n\\n\\\\- Malware attacks, Spoofing: Only the channel can send notifications on their behalf, which is verified cryptographically. Furthermore, opt in by users ensure spam isn\u2019t allowed. To ensure that channels don\u2019t turn into bad actors in the middle, we have spam score that will throttle notifications and governance to take the worst channels out.\\n\\n\\\\- Consensus-based attacks: We are still researching the best approach to follow on this but in essence, defining a quorum (like how eth tx requires multiple confirmation or how etherjs uses multiple data source) should take care of it but this is an ongoing discussion rn and we would \\\\[encourage\\\\] you to participate as well.\\n\\n\\\\- Third party risk: All our contracts are put in use after audits, $PUSH, incentives, timelocks which are live are already audited by Chainsafe: [https://epns.io/EPNS-release-Audit.pdf](https://epns.io/EPNS-release-Audit.pdf)\\n\\nWould love to discuss this further as well!\\n\\nWe are grateful and motivated \ud83d\ude4fwith all the support and participation from both communities.

We will also be implementing a notification that will allow users to sign the proposals right form the notifications if they want to.\\n\\n[TrueFi](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/truefi-taking-defi-to-new-horizons-with-epns-cc4d230d550a): We launched this channel early in the month to notify users when new loans are available for voting, and to receive alerts when loans are coming due.\\n\\n[Oasis.app](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-notifications-arrive-at-defi-on-oasis-app-770ae7ed1b): With this collaboration Oasis.app users will receive notifications directly to their wallets, allowing them to take timely action on important DeFi notifications while still protecting data privacy.\\n\\n[B.Protocol](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-notifications-to-back-backstop-liquidity-platform-b-protocol-8a93c7b96f4): With B.Protocol already simplifying the lending and liquidation by connecting lending platforms, this collaboration aims to send timely notifications through a single source of communication directly to the user\u2019s wallet.\\n\\n[Ruler Protocol](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ruler-protocol-innovating-the-defi-space-with-epns-3dc80c739097): This pilot program looks to deliver notifications to Ruler Protocol users when their loans are at least 24 hours before loan expiry, when minting rcTokens and rrTokens, when mint ratio goes significantly down, and more.\\n\\n[Boardroom](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-collaborates-with-boardroom-to-deliver-push-notifications-for-protocol-and-dao-governance-11bee8c8718e): The initial goal with this collaboration is to send notifications to Boardroom users about new proposals, voting, and brainstorming; as well as updates and results.\\n\\n[YAM Finance](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/bringing-power-of-web3notif-to-the-awesome-yam-community-95d8a39ed86c): We are currently working with the Yam.Finance team to create a channel to notify YAM users about new governance proposals. We will keep the community informed when the channel will go live.\\n\\n#### Community Activities\\n\\nWith new projects & teams coming on board with EPNS for Pilot Program Collaborations, we also want to make sure we give our communities the opportunity to learn more about what the integration means and what are the plans for the future.\\n\\nWith this in mind \u2014 we have been coordinating with our new Frens a series of cross AMAs and community calls. This ensures our communities grow strong together and have the chance to ask questions, and even participate in other activities such as our shared Meme Contests \ud83d\ude38.\\n\\nAMA transcripts are available through our [Medium](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/).\\n\\n### Development \ud83d\udea7\\n\\nEPNS keeps evolving into a much stronger protocol with a more complete feature set thanks to feedback from collaborators and the community. These are the main development activities that kept us busy this month.\\n\\n<b>Progressive Decentralized Governance</b>: this is one of our top priority items that we are aiming to align and have well-tested by the moment our protocol goes to Mainnet (end of Q3). Currently we are in the process of deploying and validating all governance tools and rules. The first step towards this Progressive Decentralized Governance will take place in August 2021\ud83d\udca3.\\n\\n<b>Chrome Browser Extension (Alpha) v0.1 is Live!</b>: While this is still an Alpha version, our team is currently working on improvements starting with better usability and UI, but will also be adding additional features to continue expanding its capabilities. Make sure to check out the release blog post and download the extension from here.\\n\\n<b>Improvements to the Mobile App</b>: switched to push-pull mechanism (push to your mobile and pull inside the app), also lazy loading of notifications available in the Android App. And we are currently working on adding the initial Channel Discovery features.\\n\\n<b>Plug & Play for Showrunners Framework</b>: providing more tooling and ease of use to the Developers community is a priority for us. This being said, we are putting efforts into improving the Showrunners framework to make the process of adding new channels much straightforward. The upcoming update on the showrunners framework makes it easier for developers to implement their customized channel logic in a plug and play manner.\\n\\n<b>Protocol optimizations and channel settings</b>: we continue working on developing furthermore the channel settings to offer more flexibility when setting up notifications. Another cool feature that we are working on right now is the implementation of gas-less transactions while subscribing and unsubscribing to a channel and sending notifications.\\n\\n<b>Ethereum PUSH Improvement Proposal (EPIP)</b>: We started working on adding the capability to sign right from a notification. For instance: voting on a proposal via YES/NO vote.\\n\\n<b>Mainnet and Push nodes</b>: another big bucket on our list. A lot of time this month was spent on feature validation and brainstorming. And while this is still a work in progress\u2026 someone mentioned something about staking nodes, and becoming blockchain agnostic \ud83e\udd10\\n\\nTo end this section with a cherry on top \ud83c\udf52 \u2014 we are excited to be working on other big and important protocol improvements that are coming soon, but they will be announced and discussed in its own blog post. Stay tuned!\\n\\nAlso, It\u2019s not a monthly review recap unless we have an alpha drop \ud83d\ude40\\n\\n![Second Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n#### EPNS Community Incentives\\n\\nThis month the community incentives come not only in the form of great continued APR percentages in our UNI-LP and PUSH pools. We still APR of 108% / 39% for LP / PUSH Staking.\\n\\n![Third Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-3.webp)\\n\\n<blockquote><i>Check it out and stake APR here: https://incentives.epns.io</i></blockquote>\\n\\nThe next biggest success among community incentives has been our Rockstars NFT, it contains custom unique art created by Indian artists and is dropped every week to the most creative community member, along with 2400 $Push.

Welcome to the EPNS Community! It is a pleasure to have you with us today.\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Hey guys! Amazing to be here and looking forward to the questions :)\\n\\n**ROSS**: Hey! Happy to be here!\\n\\n**JIM**: Hi guys, thanks for the invite!\\n\\n**JAI**: Before we start, could you guys please introduce yourself and go over your backgrounds so everyone in here gets to know you better? @rossgalloway @zetaleak @DaddyJimbo\\n\\n**ROSS**: Hey Everyone! I have been working full time for YAM for a few months now and was a part-time contributor and community member before that. I\u2019ve been in the crytpo/Ethereum space for a few years now and have recently jumped in full time. I was an architect (building buildings) before that.\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Hay all! I got into Ethereum in 2016, before that I was focused on education and some work in traditional finance marketing. Since then, I contributed to a few projects, writing content and helping with marketing and growth. At Yam I am the community lead!\\n\\n**JIM**: Marketing, branding and design have been my vocation through an agency that specialized in bringing high-tech companies to market and growing their brands\\n\\nI came to Yam as I saw a lot of opportunity to help and learn\\n\\n**JAI**: Just WOW! I am already impressed. \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nPlease when you\u2019re done answering any question, you can say **\u201cDONE.\u201d**\\n\\n**ROSS:** Good to know.\\n\\n**JIM:** Done.\\n\\n**JAI:** Let\u2019s move to the next segment of our AMA Session. \ud83d\udca5\\n\\nI hope you\u2019re ready for the next segment? I will be asking some questions! \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n**ROSS:** Ready! Pretty sure everyone else on our side is too.\\n\\n**JAI:** :D\\n\\nAlright then!\\n\\n> Q1. Why did you guys launch YAM Finance? What is the rationale behind it?\\n\\n**ROSS:** I was not part of the team that originally launched YAM finance. The original founders, Trent, Brock, Will, Clinton, and Dan put the idea out into the world but have all stepped back to let the community take over. All of the core team, like me, started out as community members and joined because we love the idea of YAM and see exciting things ahead in its future.\\n\\nYAM was launched about 11 months ago as an experiment in fair launch mechanics, community governance, and mechanism design where the YAM token was given away over a week to anyone who deposited tokens from 8 different DeFi projects in the YAM staking contracts (shoutout to Synthetix for the OG staking contracts!).\\n\\nThe original idea was to create a mashup of YFI\u2019s fair launch distribution method with the rebasing mechanics of Ampleforth, but also throw in a way for the DAO to fund a treasury that would be governed by YAM token holders. What the project was supposed to become was not defined and it was up to the token holders to figure that out.\\n\\nAfter a number of trial and tribulations (showstopping bugs, crazy price swings, and the general mayhem of a leaderless organization) things settled down a bit and the community solidified around a few core contributors with the following mission statement:\\n\\n_Yam DAO is a self-governed community building integrated and novel DeFi products designed to grow the value of the Yam Ecosystem. We are empowered by shared economic incentives in pursuit of a decentralized financial system for all._\\n\\nIn the months since launch we have removed the rebasing mechanism from the YAM token, worked to improve our governance and treasury management processes, started a partnership with UMA for our Yam Synths product, designed a proof of concept smart contract protection protocol, built out a treasury management protocol on Tokensets, and recently moved into doing more NFT and art-focused work on Ethereum and in the metaverse.\\n\\nWhile we are no longer a rebasing token, we are now focused on growing and managing our DAO treasury and building unique DeFi-centric products within the Ethereum ecosystem.\\n\\nDone. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n**JAI**: Sounds really interesting! Well done. \ud83e\udd29\\n\\nLet\u2019s move to the next Question\\n\\n> Q2. Can you talk about the milestones in your Roadmap for the remaining part of the year? And maybe a sneak peek at what\u2019s coming next year?\\n\\n**ZETALEAK:** Sure. \u201cNext year\u201d is a decade in crypto time, but I\u2019ll do my best!\\n\\nWe recently released a big upgrade to our Yam Synths product with our new website at \\\\[https://synths.yam.xyz\\\\](https://synths.yam.xyz) and we have a number of new synths in the pipeline that we are building using UMA\u2019s new LSP contracts. These are going to be what we think are pretty interesting and novel DeFi-focused synth products that are pretty unique in the space. We are hoping to release these in the next month or so.\\n\\nWe also want to build upon our uPUNKS product, which is a synth that tracks the price of LarvaLabs Cryptopunk NFTs, with other synths that let NFT owners unlock some of the value in their investments. At the same time we will continuing to iterate on the website functionality. We want to be \\\\*the\\\\* place to go to use with UMA Protocol.\\n\\nWe are also continuing to iterate on our smart contract protection protocol called Yam Protection (previously Umbrella) and have admittedly run into some bumps in the road. But we hope to keep iterating and release an MVP soon:tm:. We are hoping we can work out some of the kinks, but it may need additional work before we release so I can\u2019t promise a timeline.\\n\\nOn the NFT and metaverse front we recently had a great virtual gallery exhibit at the Museum of Fine Yams that our super talented team member Chillzone designed in CryptoVoxels. It featuring the incredible art of @dielamaharanie and @gogoporen. The exhibit is still up for anyone who wants to visit it at (https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=W@453W,86N\\\\](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=W@453W,86N).\\n\\nWe are planning on exhibiting more up and coming artists at the gallery in the near future and are looking to take some bigger steps into both how NFT art is exhibited and sold as well as virtual real estate development. It is still early days for this space and we are excited to see how it develops.\\n\\n**JAI**: Haha \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Done :)\\n\\n**JAI**: Impressive stuff! @zetaleak\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Lot\u2019s going on! :D\\n\\n**JAI**: Time for the next Question\\n\\n**ROSS**: Bring it on!\\n\\n> Q3. Can you describe the YAM Finance ecosystem? What are the main components of it, and perhaps the role of governance in the direction of your protocol?\\n\\n**ROSS**: I see YAM as having 2 distinct parts. The workings of the DAO and the different products we are building.\\n\\nWe are a true DAO in that all actions that touch our treasury require an on-chain vote with YAM tokens. We do most of our signaling and individual votes on snapshot and then roll up the passed votes into monthly on-chain votes (this has been a necessity with recent gas costs).\\n\\nThis is great since it means that token holders really do have a say in what gets done, but it also means that if a vote doesn\u2019t meet quorum then things can get delayed.\\n\\nSo building out better tools and processes for the operation of the DAO is really important to things running smoothly and we think EPNS can be very useful for that.\\n\\nThe other big category is the projects that we are building. These are all supported by the DAO, funded by the treasury, and built by contributors. Yam Synths is our most developed product, but we are working on others, as mentioned by @zetaleak above. I like to think that anyone could come to the DAO with a great idea, propose it to the community of YAM holders, and get it funded from the treasury.\\n\\nDone! :D\\n\\n**JAI**: Absolutely. \ud83e\udd17\\n\\n**ROSS**: Now this is really exciting.\\n\\nLet\u2019s move onto the next Question!\\n\\n> Q4. With this EPNS X YAM collaboration to further develop a communication/notifications layer \u2014 what are the initial use cases where you see an important impact for your user base to start receiving notifications?\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: We are going to start off with notifications for governance actions like on-chain and snapshot votes. Because governance makes the whole DAO work we need to make sure that our DAO members can stay up to date on important information and action items without spending all day in Discord.\\n\\nBeyond Governance, we want to use EPNS notifications to create a better user experience for our Yam Synths product by allowing users to get alerts about liquidation risks, synth expiries, and any other information that may be useful for them to manage or trade their synths. We haven\u2019t had a great way to get this information out to those who need it and hope that EPNS can fill that gap.\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Done! \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\nThank you @zetaleak\\n\\nTime for the last Question of this segment!\\n\\n> Q5. What is your long-term vision for the EPNS project and what other exciting things are you working on that you see a good fit for our projects to continue growing and accelerating DeFi together?\\n\\n**JIM**: Oooo, that\u2019s a tough one\u2026 We may need to ask the EPNS Wizard what he sees in the looking glass \u2014 haha.\\n\\nBeyond notifications, we see some really cool ways to create opt-in marketing campaigns and focused content creation that respects the privacy and data of our community. EPNS alerts are a blank canvas for us to create and invent on.\\n\\nYam is interested in experimentation and innovation, so as we explore deeper into what the future holds for DeFi as it fuses with the new technologies that are emerging now like NFTs and the Metaverse, etc; EPNS alerts can help stitch the various pieces together and help Yam create a more unified brand known for its superior UX and UI.\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: \\\\[TO THE MOON sticker\\\\]\\n\\n**JIM**: It\u2019s all about user experience \u2014 and that\u2019s how how we think EPNS can help Yam achieve its long-term goals.\\n\\nThe design space for the future of DeFi and the emerging technologies are huge, and EPNS is an open design space too.\\n\\n**JAI**: EPNS \ud83e\udd1d YAM Finance! \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\n**JIM**: I\u2019m very excited to go to the next phase of blue sky thinking around the possibilities of how to use EPNS in highly creative ways.\\n\\nDone\\n\\n**JAI**: Exciting times ahead for sure!\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: \\\\[icon\\\\]\\n\\n**JIM**: The Wizard knows best.\\n\\n**JAI**: For more details on the partnership, read: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/bringing-power-of-web3notif-to-the-awesome-yam-community-95d8a39ed86c](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/bringing-power-of-web3notif-to-the-awesome-yam-community-95d8a39ed86c)\\n\\nAmazing! Thank you for your answers @rossgalloway @zetaleak @DaddyJimbo! We will now move to the last round which is a Live Q/A session.\\n\\nDear Community, get ready to shoot all your Questions! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nI will UNMUTE the group soon and @rossgalloway @zetaleak @DaddyJimbo will pick and answer as many questions as possible but only participants with the BEST questions will be selected as winners!\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: gif\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: Let\u2019s do it!!!! \ud83d\udc4c\\n\\n**JAI**: 3..\\n\\n2\u2026\\n\\nAnd\u2026..\\n\\n**JAI**: GO GO GO!!!!!!\\n\\n\\\\[100+ questions are submitted by the community\\\\]\\n\\n**JAI**: Our chat is on MUTE again. We have got the last set of Questions from community members.\\n\\n> EMILIA: Kindly explain more about your Tokenomics, Release Schedule and UTILITY, is it inflationary or deflationary?\\n\\n**ROSS**: The tokenomics are mostly up to the DAO. There was an initial release of the tokens during our farming event where they were given away to the community. We have since voted to extend rewards and mint YAM for contributor compensation. The Token holders vote on whether more YAM are printed. It is all in the hands of the community!\\n\\nYAM is a governance token but we are working on different utilities for the token, whether farming, or in synths, and more. We encourage anyone interested to come participate and let their ideas be known!\\n\\n**JAI**: @rossgalloway @zetaleak @DaddyJimbo you can pick and answer the BEST 10 Questions in total. This AMA is getting interesting!\\n\\n> DUMMA LIFE: Without proper marketing and capital infusion, project dies, how do you convince us you have adequate marketing power and capital to push this project to the top project?\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: We are focused on building products that provide real opportunities and financial freedom for people globally! We\u2019ve also built a strong reputation for treasury management, ensuring decentralized communities protect their funds to ensure a long-term growth roadmap!\\n\\n> TRIKA MINA: Who participate in the public-sale event and holding the token for long term, how will these early investors benefit greatly from the project?\\n\\nROSS: Anyone was able to participate in the initial release of tokens last year by locking up any one of 8 different DeFi Tokens. We were one of the first fair launch farming tokens! There was no private or public crowd sale.\\n\\n> KEVIN: Staking programme is very important for any project, Can I stake your token? Do you have any plan of starting staking programme?\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: You can absolutely stake YAM and also earn yield for providing liquidity to our synthetic products like uPUNKS! Check it out here: [https://synths.yam.xyz/](https://synths.yam.xyz/)\\n\\n> LOLI: What major partnerships does YAM Finance intend to use or how does YAM Finance bring its products to the average consumer, especially non-crypto users?\\n\\n**JIM**: Good question: The average consumer who is not yet in DeFi will come at some point and this is one area that we are experimenting in and planning for. I do think this is the mother load of opportunity. We are heading this way on two fronts. One, with UMA and Crypto.com a potential partnership currently in consideration around bringing exposure to CryptoPunks via our uPunk synth. Two, by experimenting in the the NFT, metaverse, social tokens space.\\n\\n> BAULA DEA: Your project plans to operate in a public and transparent way, which is good, but how involved will the community be within the project to make the best decisions and thus strengthen the ecosystem\u2026\u2026?\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: We already do! We are fully decentralized so all decisions are made by YAM token holders.\\n\\n> STARCRYPTO FI: Until what corner of the world do you plan to arrive? That is, to what extent in the world do you think YAM Finance will be solving people\u2019s problems with their infrastructure?\\n\\n**JIM**: YAM Finance is not going after infrastructure plays. Yam is much more interested in composing on top of existing infrastructure which is being developed by others. Think of Yam as a creative studio that designs customer-focused solutions in emerging areas of DeFi.\\n\\n> MASON GREYBACK: Revenue is an important aspect for all projects to survive and maintain the project/company. What is your plan and way to generate profit/revenue from tokens? In this regard, please explain your income model?\\n\\n**ROSS**: In terms of earning revenues and becoming successful, we have a 2-pronged approach. Our main goal is to build products and services that generate revenues for the DAO. We are still in the early stages for most of our projects so it may take some time for them to really be able to stand on their own, but we know that they need to be sustainable for us to be successful. We also use our treasury the invest in our own projects and other projects (mainly ETH and other large cap DeFi projects).\\n\\n> TUYET NGAN: Can you share Your opinion about Defi & NFT ? What makes your NFTs rate and special?\\n\\n**ZETALEAK**: We absolutely believe DeFi is the future of finance and we are already seeing that playing out today!\\n\\nNFTs are also a powerful technological revolution and we\u2019re thrilled to be taking a leading role in this ecosystem, both producing our own NFTs, showcasing artists and providing infrastructure!\\n\\nOur upcoming PunkFiction drop are unique 1/1 hand drawn works, so they are valuable as works of art!\\n\\n> KARL SMITH: How secure is your platform to use? Have you done audits of the smart contracts? What security measures are adopted from bugs of smart contracts and hacking?\\n\\n**ROSS**: All the projects that we currently have deployed (Yam Synths, Yam Treasuries) are built on audited contracts (UMA and Set Protocol). Our initial smart contracts for the YAM token had a bug in them that required us to pivot to a new contract and was almost a disaster. We managed to avoid the worst outcome but it showed how important audits are and we have been sure to get all our subsequent contracts audited and are careful not to rush them out just to say that we did.\\n\\nSo yes, all our current projects and the token contract are audited. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n> HA PHIEU: Current NFT is a hot topic, but are NFT not just for art. Does YAM Finance think that more real world use cases will emerge for NFTs as time goes on? Why should we take NFTs seriously?\\n\\n**JIM**: Art is the area of NFT of first awareness and adoption, and the potential in this area, I think, will have a long tail \u2014 such as social extensions, etc. But non-fungible tokens have so much more potential for the tokenization of much of the traditional world. That will come. Yam is diving deep into the art side of NFTs to start with, but with a vision for the tokenization potential as mentioned above.\\n\\n> KK \u2014 LIANG: Many projects rug pulled and exit scam recently. Why should investors trust your project not to do the same?\\n\\n**ROSS**: By design, any malicious action would require YAM token holders to vote for it, so it is pretty much impossible for us to rug pull or exit scam!\\n\\n> LFC BOY: How does YAM Treasury decide the kind of products to invest in, that would give valuable returns? Are there criteria to be met?\\n>\\n> What kind of decisions can members of YAM DAO vote for, in the governance of the project? How can anyone be a member?\\n\\n@zetaleak\\n\\n@rossgalloway\\n\\n@DaddyJimbo\\n\\n**ROSS**: YAM token holders have the power to decide how they want to spend treasury funds. We also use snapshot to get buy in on what direction the DAO should move in. These are community decisions that need buy in from the developers and core team since they are doing most of the work to make them happen, but it is the community that eventually decides what gets funded.\\n\\nAnyone can vote in the DAO if they hold YAM tokens. There is no other requirement. We welcome anyone to come join our community on discord. You can find links on our website: [https://yam.finance](https://yam.finance)\\n\\n> LUCY: Are you planning to spend big marketing dollars to get the market place going? With financial exchanges, community is very important, so what is your marketing plan and what will you do to gain the trust of users?\\n\\n**JIM**: Yam does not plan to spend \u2018big marketing dollars\u2019 in the conventional way. Instead, Yam invests building an exceptional team, building community and innovating new products through experimenting around the next wave of DeFi.\\n\\n> I\ud83d\udc9aHANOI: Hello, What is the next big step for your project \u2014 YAM ? Thank you!\\n\\nWe are creating a Strategic Vision to drive Yam into the future. The vision will dovetail with our current projects but also officially define a parallel track of new innovations. The vision describes how these two parallel tracks will complement and enhance each other, and eventually merge.\\n\\n> CR_7: In your view how has the trajectory of yield farming and yield aggregating platforms changed in the past year?\\n\\n**ROSS**: Great question! Yield farming has really evolved as the participants became more savvy and projects saw the limitations of some of the more standard yield farming models. While fair launches like the YAM and YFI launches were very successful and egalitarian, they don\u2019t always incentivize the community and contributors for long-term success and have required additional raises and rethinking of reward distributions.\\n\\nNew projects are starting to experiment with vesting, requiring active work and other innovations in the space. In the end, all these yield farming experiments are trying to make their projects better and more successful in the long term, so I expect to see further experimentation as the space matures and people get a better understanding of what is optimal.\\n\\nThat was a lot of questions!\\n\\n**JAI**: Thank you for your insightful answers, @DaddyJimbo @zetaleak @rossgalloway.

B.Protocol has developed a decentralized backstop liquidity protocol that aggregates popular lending protocols under a model that provides additional yield to both lenders and borrowers. EPNS is pleased to announce the launch of a pilot program to provide decentralized push notifications to support B.Protocol\u2019s more efficient lending model.\\n\\n# Sharing Lending Platform Profits With Push Notifications\\n\\nB.Protocol has developed a decentralized backstop liquidity protocol that enables backstop liquidity providers (BLP) the rights to liquidate under-collateralized loans on Compound, MakerDAO, and soon other platforms as well. Since liquidators no longer bid up gas prices to be the highest priority transaction for undercollateralized loans, profits are higher. The BLPs share their higher profits with platform users. As a result, lenders and borrowers receive additional yield to standard interest rates.\\n\\nB.Protocol liquidators provide a cushion to a borrower\u2019s undercollateralized account in exchange for priority in the liquidation process by bidding at auction for a franchise and the percent of profit sharing. Users receive a percent of the profit share based on their usage of the platform. And since the liquidators have a stake in the franchise, they are less likely to abandon uncollateralized assets when market conditions change.\\n\\nOn lending protocols such as Compound, for example, when the liquidation price is reached, the BLP liquidates the position on B.Protocol and then shares the profit with the users. By shifting the profits from miners and costly gas wars to loan stakeholders through a smart contract, both the liquidator and lending platform users earn more.\\n\\nThe B.Protocol smart contract connects the different lending platforms, providing lenders and borrowers a choice of interest rates and fees. Managing lending and liquidation, however, involves messages from multiple platforms with no central messaging service. One essential element is missing, decentralized push notifications. DeFi lending platform users are highly dependent on notification services to manage loan services, including:\\n\\n- Data price feeds such as the best lending interest rates and liquidity pool fees\\n- Real-time notifications on transaction status and gas price alerts\\n- Collateralization ratios and liquidation alerts\\n- Notices of liquidation events and auctions\\n\\nThough B.Protocol simplifies lending and liquidation by connecting lending platforms, the lack of a decentralized push notification service, until now, means important notifications may be distributed to multiple places, such as email or a Telegram account. A push notification service would allow all platform users to receive and take timely action on important lending notifications while still protecting data privacy as B.Protocol users interact with internal and external data sources.\\n\\n> _EPNS, much like B.Protocol, is building a new building block that was missing until now in DeFi. We are super excited to collaborate with the team at EPNS in order to bring our users real time notifications in a decentralized manner to keep them updated with their funds on the lending markets we are integrated with. Yaron Velner, Founder and lead developer of B.Protocol_\\n\\n# The EPNS Solution\\n\\nThe EPNS decentralized push notification service sends timely notifications through a single source of communication, the investor\u2019s wallet. All notifications go directly to the user\u2019s wallet where they can take immediate action. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet. The partnership benefits to B.Protocol users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all data notifications directly to B.Protocol user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and B.Protocol teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the various push notification needs of DeFi data users and markets.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different data notification requirements.\\n\\n# How EPNS Will Support B.Protocol\\n\\nUnder this pilot program, EPNS is building a dedicated channel for B.Protocol (see our lightpaper for definitions of channels, services, and more). B.Protocol users can subscribe to the B.Protocol channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets. Through collaboration with the B.Protocol team, we will gain insight into the push notification needs of users of lending platforms and what they want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nDecentralized notifications will provide real-time data to one wallet so all users can act in a timely manner. Lenders and borrowers can identify the most attractive interest rates and fees across lending platforms. Meanwhile, all users can continue to operate within the private, secure ecosystem of B.Protocol across different lending protocols, without having to deal with integration pains across many different protocols.\\n\\n> _EPNS push notifications will help lending platform users and liquidators extract and share more value from B.Protocol. Reliable notifications have a role in ensuring liquidators have confidence in and are committed to the lending platform, commented Harsh Rajat, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service._\\n\\nLooking forward, and as B.Protocol v2 launch is behind the corner, we foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced for B.Protocol in particular, and DeFi lending markets in general. The elimination of high gas fees makes decentralized lending accessible to more borrowers and more lucrative for all lending platform users. The role of the BLPs as backers lowers liquidity risk. Push notifications will be essential to enable future B.Protocol users to take advantage of the best lending and liquidation rates. Thus, we view decentralized push notifications as an important service that will accelerate the mass adoption of decentralized lending. Since B.Protocol is at the forefront of creating a new liquidator-backed liquidation model, we expect our partnership to yield many new useful notification services and features for the decentralized lending market.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of B.Protocol. DeFi lending users \u2014 who can easily integrate the EPNS protocol into a wallet \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service. Going forward, we also expect to work closely with B.Protocol users to create new messaging solutions to meet their evolving push notification needs.\\n\\nWe are pleased to be partnering with B.Protocol and anticipate EPNS push notifications becoming an indispensable tool in decentralized lending markets.\\n\\n## About B.Protocol\\n\\nB.Protocol is a backstop liquidity protocol for decentralized lending platforms. A new DeFi lego primitive, bringing traditional finance systems best practices into DeFi, aiming to stabilize the ever growing market of DeFi assets which are crucially dependent on adequate liquidation processes. By creating better liquidation systems we unleash better capital efficiency for the entire DeFi ecosystem. B.Protocol is a fully decentralized protocol which is being governed by $BPRO token holders.\\n\\nGet involved \u2014 [Website](https://www.bprotocol.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bprotocoleth), [Discord](https://discord.gg/bJ4guuw), [Forum](https://forum.bprotocol.org/), [Medium](https://medium.com/b-protocol)"},{"id":"ruler-protocol-innovating-the-defi","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/ruler-protocol-innovating-the-defi","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-20-ruler-protocol-innovating-the-defi/index.md","title":"Ruler Protocol innovating the DeFi space with EPNS","description":"Ruler Protocol innovating the DeFi space with EPNS","date":"2021-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 20, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ama","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ama"},{"label":"Yam Finance","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/yam-finance"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"}],"readingTime":1.1033333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"ruler-protocol-innovating-the-defi","title":"Ruler Protocol innovating the DeFi space with EPNS","description":"Ruler Protocol innovating the DeFi space with EPNS","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"DeFi and the peer-to-peer lending and borrowing space have been ever-expanding and have been one of the killer use-cases of the Web3 ecosystem.

Although most peer-to-peer lending protocols rely on the value of the collateral provided for the loans, this often comes with the risk of liquidation at times of market volatility. In order to combat this, Ruler protocol has arrived with non-liquidatable fixed-term loans for those who may not want to take the risk of liquidation.\\n\\nRuler Protocol allows users to take short-term, fixed-rate, market-priced loans. They are non-recourse or non-liquidatable loans, and users are only required to pay back their loans prior to the due date to receive their collateral back. Interest rates are not determined by a bonding curve, but rather by market supply and demand. Ruler also allows for fungible loans where the debt/credit itself is represented as ERC20 tokens.\\n\\nAlthough Ruler Protocol allows for fixed-term loans (often with a time period of 1 month), users of the protocol have no way of being reminded about their next due date for paying back the loan, before it\u2019s too late.\\n\\nIn this context, we are thrilled to announce our pilot collaboration with Ruler Protocol to build a robust and decentralized communication layer for Ruler.\\n\\nFor our pilot program, we will be working with Ruler to bring:\\n\\n- Reminders for Ruler Protocol users about their loans at least 24 hours before loan expiry.\\n- Notifications when minting rcTokens or rrTokens.\\n- Notifications when mint ratio goes down significantly\\n- Other complex automated notifications.\\n\\nWe are delighted to be able to work with Ruler Protocol and take one more step towards decentralizing the communication layer of DeFi and Web3.\\n\\n## **About Ruler Protocol**\\n\\nRuler is a peer-to-peer DeFi borrowing and lending platform, offering loans that are free of liquidation risk.\\n\\nYou can stay in touch with Ruler Protocol on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RulerProtocol) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XcAQKg2YGP)."},{"id":"ama-with-alpha-finance-lab","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/ama-with-alpha-finance-lab","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-19-ama-with-alpha-finance-lab/index.md","title":"AMA with Alpha Finance Lab","description":"AMA with Alpha Finance Lab","date":"2021-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 19, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ama","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ama"},{"label":"Yam Finance","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/yam-finance"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"}],"readingTime":9.573333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"ama-with-alpha-finance-lab","title":"AMA with Alpha Finance Lab","description":"AMA with Alpha Finance Lab","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We had the pleasure to have Tascha Panpan from Alpha Finance Lab joining our community on 16th July 2021 for an AMA session.

It is a pleasure to have you with us today.\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Hi everyone! Glad to be here.\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: Before we start, could you please introduce yourself and go over your background so everyone here gets to know you better @tascha_panpan?\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Sure thing. I\u2019m Co-Founder and CEO of Alpha Finance Lab. Previously, I was head of strategy at Band Protocol, product manager at Tencent, and originally an investment banker in traditional finance. Graduated from UC Berkeley, so go Bears!\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: Impressive stuff @tascha_panpan!!\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Done.\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: Let\u2019s move to the next segment of our AMA Session.\\n\\nI hope you\u2019re ready for the next segment? I will be asking some questions. \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Let\u2019s do it!\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: Hehe.\\n\\n> _Why did you guys launch Alpha Finance Lab? What is the rationale behind it?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: The first product that we built is Alpha Homora, the first leverage yield farming product in DeFi. Before Alpha Homora, there was no such concept as leverage yield farming.\\n\\nCurrently, we are building AlphaX, our new and second product in the derivatives space. We\u2019re taking the same mindset we did with Alpha Homora to AlphaX, so pretty much creating a new category of our own in the derivatives space.\\n\\nOur rationale behind this vision is that we believe that DeFi is here to stay. However, given the nascent stage DeFi is in, the industry will inevitably go through significant changes as it matures.\\n\\nSo, being able to react quickly to the market/change in the DeFi landscape and building/incubating products that capture unaddressed demand as the landscape matures will ensure Alpha Finance Lab continues to play a key role in DeFi throughout the industry lifecycle.\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: Please remember to let me know when you are done. \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Done.\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: Awesome. Thanks for sharing this with us. Let\u2019s move over to the second question.\\n\\n> _Can you walk us through Alpha\u2019s product offering, and maybe talk a little about the recent launch of Alpha Launchpad?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Sure, as mentioned briefly earlier, the first Alpha product is Alpha Homora.\\n\\nThis is the app on Ethereum: [https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/](https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/)\\n\\nThis is the one on BSC: [https://homora-bsc.alphafinance.io/](https://homora-bsc.alphafinance.io/)\\n\\nThere are 2 types of users who can use Alpha Homora.\\n\\n1.  Lenders. So for Alpha Homora V2 on Ethereum, lenders can lend a number of assets and earn high lending interest rates. Many of these assets are also not supported on any other lending protocols, or if supported, the yields are a lot lower than those on Alpha Homora V2.\\n2.  Leverage yield farmers. These are the users who want to yield farm in a more capital efficient way. This means you can use Alpha Homora to yield farm, for instance farming SUSHI on Sushiswap, but you will get a lot more returns with the same starting capital than if you were to yield farm normally. This is because Alpha Homora allows you to take leverage to yield farm.\\n\\nFor more info, you can also check out the step-by-step guide here:https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora-v2/yield-farmers/tbd-types-of-pools-and-where-apy-comes-from\\n\\nI\u2019ll keep AlphaX details for now, as we haven\u2019t shared those publicly. Stay tuned though ;)\\n\\nRecently, we also launched Alpha Launchpad, which is the first DeFi incubator program built by builders for builders.\\n\\nAlpha Launchpad is the only launchpad program that focuses on incubating DeFi projects from the ground up and driving significant growth post-launch.\\n\\nThe incubated projects will get to work with the core Alpha team and a number of key DeFi community members and contributors on all things the teams need to launch and grow successfully. The Alpha Launchpad team will help advise and mentor.\\n\\nIn returns, Alpha community \\\\[members\\\\]who stake their ALPHA tokens on [https://tokenomics.alphafinance.io/](https://tokenomics.alphafinance.io/) will also get a share of the incubated projects tokens by simply staking their ALPHA tokens.\\n\\nFor those who are interested in applying to the Alpha Launchpad, you can find more information here as well: [https://launchpad.alphafinance.io/](https://launchpad.alphafinance.io/)\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: Wow. This is great, I can\u2019t wait to use your product and I know our community members are also interested. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nLet\u2019s move to the next question.\\n\\n> _Can you talk to us about what\u2019s coming for Alpha, and what milestones you are looking to achieve this year?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: AlphaX is coming up next for the Alpha community. AlphaX is our new and second product in the derivatives space.\\n\\nThis year, there are many milestones we are looking to achieve.\\n\\nOn Alpha products side, we are looking to launch AlphaX and grow AlphaX to be the go-to derivatives platform in DeFi. All of this is while continuing to grow Alpha Homora V2. We\u2019ll also continue to brainstorm more Alpha products that we see should be built to capture the market demand.\\n\\nOn the Alpha Launchpad side, we are looking to incubate quite a number of quality projects this year. This means there are going to be a number of incubated projects\u2019 tokens that ALPHA stakers will get this year. We\u2019re looking to continue growing the Alpha Launchpad team and decentralize it as well.\\n\\nOn the Alpha Launchpad side, we are looking to incubate quite a number of quality projects this year. This means there are going to be a number of incubated projects\u2019 tokens that ALPHA stakers will get this year. We\u2019re looking to continue growing the Alpha Launchpad team and decentralize it as well.\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: So many exciting things coming. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd17\\n\\nLet\u2019s move to the 4th question.\\n\\n> _Can you please elaborate on what Alpha is looking to achieve with this collaboration with EPNS, and what\u2019s the desired impact for your users?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: For sure, EPNS helps a lot with notifications service for Alpha Homora users (leverage yield farmers type). With leverage yield farming, users can be at liquidation risk, since by leveraging Alpha Homora will borrow assets to yield farm for users.\\n\\nWith any borrowing, liquidation can take place if the borrowed amount exceeds the value the protocol allows users to borrow (to ensure the safety of the protocol and lenders).\\n\\nSo with EPNS, Alpha Homora users can subscribe to the notification system and get notified when their positions are at liquidation risk, so users can quickly manage the positions before they are actually liquidated\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: I am enjoying this AMA. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nLet\u2019s move to the last question of this segment.\\n\\n> _How do you think the product offering from Alpha will be used together with EPNS in the future?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: I think if EPNS can expand the support to notify Alpha Homora users even before they are at liquidation risk, that would be amazing.\\n\\nAdditionally, if EPNS can notify any DeFi user when there is a spike in lending interest rates in a particular asset on Alpha Homora, that would help a lot of lenders in DeFi too. Because at the moment, Alpha Homora V2 generates the highest lending interest among all lending protocols. So we also want to let more people know of these great rates, and we think EPNS can help with the notification system.\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: Amazing, Thank you for your answers @tascha_panpan! We will now move to the last round which is a Live Q/A session.\\n\\nSince we announced the ALPHA Finance Lab x EPNS AMA, the excitement in our community has really increased. It\u2019s time to give them a chance to ask their questions. I can\u2019t wait to see what they have in their fridge \ud83d\ude05\\n\\nDear Community, get ready to shoot all your Questions! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nI will UNMUTE the group soon and @tascha_panpan will pick and answer as many questions as possible but only participants with the BEST questions will be selected as winners at the end of the AMA.\\n\\nAre you all ready?\\n\\n3..\\n\\n2\u2026.\\n\\n1\u2026..\\n\\n\\\\[Over 300 questions are submitted by community members.\\\\]\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: Wow\u2026.I am not surprised by the number of questions. I know many have been waiting. \ud83d\ude05\\n\\nOur chat is on MUTE again. We have got the last set of Questions from community members.\\n\\nHow\u2019s the response @tascha_panpan? haha\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: How many should I select to answer?\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: You can pick and answer the BEST Questions, any number you want to Answer. 10 is fine \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n> **_XPERIA_**_: Hi!_\\n>\\n> _What is Alpha Homora V1 and V2? How do they work and how will users get benefits of this features? What are the differences?_\\n>\\n> _@tascha_panpan_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: I definitely cannot not answer the first question, impressive to be the first one sending from all the questions submitted here.\\n\\nV1 and V2 are different in a number of ways\\n\\nAs a lender, if you lend on V1, you can only lend ETH. On V2, you can lend many assets. This is because leverage yield farmers on V2 can borrow many assets to yield farm. \\\\[They are\\\\]not required to only borrow ETH like on V1.\\n\\nOn the yield farmers\u2019 side, apart from being able to borrow multiple assets to yield farm, you can also supply the LP token as collateral.\\n\\nV2 is also a lot more flexible, allowing us to support non-ETH farms, such as the stablecoin pool (Curve 3 pool) as well.\\n\\n> **_TINY_**_: Could you please tell me just a little more about the team and some of their backgrounds? I have personally seen many projects launch with inexperienced team members, and some of those didn\u2019t go so well due to easily avoidable mistakes._\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Hi Tiny, sure thing. You know my background already from the beginning of the AMA. Let me share Nipun\u2019s background here as well, as he\u2019s a Co-Founder and CTO.\\n\\nNipun graduated from MIT with a masters degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (4.9/5.0) and a bachelor degree in Mathematics (4.9/5.0) and Computer Science (4.9/5.0). He also has won 4 gold medals and 1 silver medal from the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), and is currently ranked 3rd in the IMO hall-of-fame (global ranking).\\n\\nHe\u2019s worked in multiple areas and developed a number of tech before co-founding Alpha Finance Lab, such as an automated stock price prediction algorithm based on quantitative time-series data. He also self-developed an algorithm to detect and trade arbitrages in cryptocurrency markets.\\n\\n> **_UNIDENTIFIED_**_: What are the ways of earning Alpha ? Can I mine it? What are the benefits when I hold Alpha ?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN:** Assuming you have no ALPHA at all, you can earn ALPHA by doing 2 things.\\n\\n1. Lend ETH, USDT, USDC, or DAI on Alpha Homora V2: [https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/.](https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/) Apart from the lending interest rate, you will also get ALPHA.\\n\\n2. Leverage yield farm of more than 1x leverage on Alpha Homora V2.\\n\\nFor more details on leverage yield farm and a step-by-step guide, you can check here: [https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora-v2/tbd-overview-of-alpha-homora-v2-dapp](https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora-v2/tbd-overview-of-alpha-homora-v2-dapp)\\n\\nOnce you have ALPHA, you can stake them on Alpha Tokenomics and that is where you will unlock much value from there. Let me explain a bit more on the value you get from staking ALPHA. Can stake here: [https://tokenomics.alphafinance.io/](https://tokenomics.alphafinance.io/)\\n\\nBy staking ALPHA you will get\\n\\n1. ALPHA (this is not minted, but this is the protocol fees Alpha products have collected and we are distributing the fees to ALPHA stakers).\\n\\n2. Incubated projects tokens. Since we created the Alpha Launchpad incubator program, we make sure the incubated projects bring value to the ALPHA stakers by distributing a portion of their tokens to ALPHA stakers. For instance, Beta Finance, which is the first Alpha Launchpad incubated project, they are going to distribute a portion of BETA token when they launch to ALPHA stakers as well.\\n\\n3. Down the line, you will also earn incubated projects\u2019 protocol fees (selected projects) as well.\\n\\nAll of these are earned by simply staking ALPHA.\\n\\n> **_UNIDENTIFIED_**_: What is the PROJECT\u2019s revenue model? In which ways do you generate revenue/profit?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Alpha generates revenues from many ways.\\n\\nFor Alpha Homora, we collect 20% of borrow interest rate as protocol fees on Alpha Homora V2 (and 10% on V1, 10% on vBSC).\\n\\nFor AlphaX, there are going to be a number of ways we will collect fees.\\n\\nFor Alpha Launchpad, incubated projects\u2019 tokens will be considered revenue for the Alpha community too, as they will get them by staking ALPHA.\\n\\nLastly, some of the incubated projects will also distribute a portion of their protocol fees to ALPHA stakers, so another revenue stream for the Alpha community.\\n\\nAs a side note, currently more than 37% of ALPHA\u2019s circulating supply is being staked at the moment.\\n\\n> **_UNIDENTIFIED_**_: As a community-based project, How can I support Alpha Finance\u2019s success? Do you have a Global Ambassador Program or a Referral Rewards System?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: We have an Alpha Grants Program, in which anyone can support Alpha as an \u2018Alpha Builder\u2019 or \u2018Alpha Thinker\u2019.\\n\\nWe are rolling out a lot more community initiatives within a month or so as well, so there will be more ways the community can contribute and support the project.\\n\\nMore details about the Alpha Grant Program here: [https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-finance-lab/alpha-grants-program/overview-of-developer-grants](https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-finance-lab/alpha-grants-program/overview-of-developer-grants)\\n\\n> **_UNIDENTIFIED_**_: For Alpha, what security features will be implemented to prevent hacking due to bugs in smart contracts? Does the Alpha team test regularly to identify vulnerabilities?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Yes, we have implemented a number of things on this front to ensure top security for all Alpha products.\\n\\n1. Multiple audits by top security audit firms\\n\\n2. Continuous peer reviews by trusted and the most respected security researchers in the space\\n\\n3. Continuous internal reviews\\n\\n4. Internal monitoring tools\\n\\n5. Active bug bounty program with Immunefi\\n\\n> **_HOA VAN_**_: I see your project Alpha developing many products! This is an advantage being able to meet most of the user\u2019s needs! However, does developing multiple products make it difficult to manage? How do you guarantee the quality of all the products in Alpha?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Good question, and actually not hard to manage, as we have many sub-teams inside the Alpha team. Each sub-team acts like a unit of its own to maintain and grow each product going forward. We guarantee the quality of all Alpha products by having the core team (not the sub-team) build the product itself. This means the core team will build all Alpha products while the sub-teams will further take the built product to maintain and grow even further.\\n\\n> **_JOLYNN DOBBS_**_: What are the key milestones on your roadmap, both things you have already achieved and things that we can look forward to?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: You can check out the recent things we have achieved and the roadmap here: [https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-finance-lab-vision-roadmap/](https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-finance-lab-vision-roadmap/)\\n\\n> **_KYLA WHITTEN_**_: How can users stay updated with this project? Are there channels, including local communities where users can get the latest updates?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: The Alpha website would be the best start, as it contains all links and docs there: [https://alphafinance.io/](https://alphafinance.io/)\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: One more to go. \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n> **_KITTEN FUN_**_: I am quite impressed with your project name, so can you tell me where it comes from? What does it mean to you and why did you choose that name for your project?_\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: The name Alpha Finance Lab came from multiple core ideas we hold for our project.\\n\\n1.  Alpha = We make sure our products help generate alpha for users. Alpha in finance is the additional gains you get on top of the standard gains in the market.\\n2.  Finance = e are focused on the DeFi area.\\n3.  Lab = We are a DeFi lab, so we want to have the name showcase this essence of our project. Being a DeFi lab will allow us to innovate and keep up with the fast-paced industry\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n**DANTES STAN**: Thank you for your insightful answers, @tascha_panpan. We highly appreciate it and this ends the last round of our AMA. \ud83d\udcaa\\n\\n**TASCHA PANPAN**: Thank you Dantes and everyone in the EPNS community!\\n\\nAgain, below are the quick links to the Alpha community.

An important step in lowering these frictions involves building powerful and user centric tooling that quickly and easily alerts users of important topics and decisions that will impact their network. Decentralized notifications provide a huge leap forward in user experience by providing timely information to diverse stakeholders, and will completely change how folks interact with network governance moving forward.\\n\\n## **Why Boardroom needs decentralized notifications**\\n\\n[Boardroom](https://www.boardroom.info/) is a governance platform improving distributed decision-making across stakeholder-owned crypto networks, with its dashboard facilitating simple and transparent stakeholder oversight and management of this new paradigm of organizations and communities. The collaborative platform brings together a standardized interface, proposal viewing, and discussions. Yet without Push Notifications, governance participants are still required to keep an eye on email, social, and other channels to stay up to date with the latest activities, resulting in a lower engagement and participation level.\\n\\n## **Solution: Instant Wallet Notifications With EPNS**\\n\\nBy implementing EPNS Push Notifications, Boardroom users will receive information directly to their wallets in a timely manner. Not only will they receive notifications about ongoing events, but also an actionable link that makes participation easier and thus encourages engagement.\\n\\nThe collab benefits to Boardroom users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send notifications about new proposals, voting, and brainstorming; as well as updates and results.\\n- Boardroom will work together with the EPNS team to meet the evolving and future notification needs of users on the platform.\\n- Boardroom users will be able to customize notification settings and formats for different product needs.\\n\\n## **EPNS-Boardroom Collaboration: What We Plan to Achieve**\\n\\nDuring this \u201cpilot program\u201d collaboration with Boardroom, we will build a channel for Boardroom where users can subscribe to receive notifications. These notifications will benefit from the different notification formats available from EPNS to provide highly customizable and effective outreach, which can include receiving updates about ongoing proposals and voting, alerts when new proposals have been added, and more. Working with the Boardroom team will enable technical discussions towards building a communication layer that is powerful and flexible for the most demanding governance needs.\\n\\nWith Boardroom being one of the key players in the development of efficient governance tools and products, we foresee many more notification channels set in motion to fulfil all governance participants\u2019 requirements.\\n\\nBoardroom is a clear example of governance put into practice, and for us it is a pleasure to work side-by-side with a team that reflects our same core principles.\\n\\nBrainstorm, Vote, Learn, Notify!\\n\\n## **About Boardroom**\\n\\nBoardroom is an integrated governance management platform improving distributed decision making across crypto networks with tools and services for high-value digital stakeholder interactions. Boardroom\u2019s mission is to enable stakeholder-owned platforms to scale while upholding the interests of all their constituencies, by providing a dashboard that facilitates simple and transparent stakeholder oversight and management of DAOs.\\n\\nStay in touch!

Dai can be created by opening Vaults (overcollateralized debt positions) through Oasis.app, which aims to be the most trusted decentralized application to interact with the Maker Protocol and to manage vaults. EPNS is pleased to deepen its exploration of push notification use cases, using Dai by launching a pilot program to provide decentralized push notifications for monitoring Maker Vaults on Oasis.app. Maker Vault owners can now enjoy a trading edge by receiving notifications when a price of an asset goes above or below a certain threshold, changing the collateralization ratio, and then being aware when the Vault risks being liquidated .\\n\\n# Maximize DeFi Opportunities With Oasis.app and Maker Vaults Powered by Push Notifications\\n\\nWith a market cap surpassing $5 billion, the usage of the Dai stablecoin is growing, particularly in DeFi applications where it is being combined in a multitude of ways with DeFi products to reduce price volatility. Oasis.app is the most trusted way to access the Maker Protocol so anyone can borrow and use Dai anywhere through its simple user interface.\\n\\nOasis.app makes it easy to borrow Dai by opening a Maker Vault, a deposit account for MakerDAO\u2019s Dai. After connecting a wallet to Oasis, users can open a Vault, deposit collateral and generate Dai against it. Borrowers can choose from more than 30 crypto collateral sources (e.g., ETH, WBTC, USDT), with more added weekly, and all with their own risk parameters and minimum collateralisation ratios. Oasis connects to more than half a dozen wallets making it easy to collateralize Dai and borrow with no fixed repayment schedules.\\n\\nManaging DeFi services, however, involves a lot of checking of different sources and messages from multiple platforms yet no central messaging service exists. One essential element is missing, **decentralized push notifications**. In order to worry less about what might happen, Oasis.app users are highly dependent on a notification service that would help them to manage their Maker Vaults, including:\\n\\n- When the Vault might be at risk of liquidation on the next price update due to a sudden price drop\\n- When the Vault has reached a certain collateralization ratio that you\u2019d like to take a certain action at, either to buy additional collateral, or repay.\\n- When risk parameters, such as Stability Fee\u2019s or Debt Ceiling changes are made by Maker Governance that affect a Vault you own.\\n\\nThough Oasis.app simplifies access to the Maker Protocol, the lack of a decentralized push notification service, until now, means important notifications are distributed to multiple places, such as email or a Twitter or Telegram account. A push notification service sending all notifications to the Oasis.app wallet would **allow all platform users to receive and take timely action on important DeFi notifications while still protecting data privacy** as Oasis.app users interact with internal and external data sources.\\n\\n> _Receiving notifications directly within Oasis.app will allow our customers to live a safer and conscious experience, without always worrying about checking different sources. It has always been one of the most asked-for features and that is why this partnership is crucial to us.- Chris Bradbury, CEO of Oasis.app_\\n\\n# The EPNS Solution\\n\\nThe EPNS decentralized push notification service sends timely notifications through a single source of communication, the investor\u2019s wallet. All Maker Vault notifications will go directly to the user\u2019s Oasis.app wallet where they can track vault positions and take immediate action. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet. The partnership benefits to Oasis.app users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all data notifications directly to Oasis.app user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and Oasis.app teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the various push notification needs of Dai users in DeFi markets.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different notification requirements.\\n\\n# How EPNS Will Support Oasis.app\\n\\nUnder this pilot program, EPNS is building a dedicated channel for Oasis.app (see our lightpaper for definitions of channels, services, and more). Oasis.app users can subscribe to the Oasis.app channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets. Through collaboration with the Oasis.app team, we will gain insight into the push notification needs of Maker Vault and Dai stablecoin users and what they want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nDecentralized notifications will provide real-time Maker Vault data to Oasis.app Vault owners so all users can act in a timely manner and benefit from real time information on all their open Vaults.Meanwhile, all users can continue to operate within the private, secure ecosystem of Oasis.app across all DeFi services, without having to deal with integration pains across many different protocols.\\n\\n> Maker Vault is a powerful tool leveraging the stablecoin Dai to make borrowing, saving, and trading more efficient. Push notifications to the Oasis.app will ensure users can act in a timely manner and optimize their vault and DeFi positions, commented Harsh Rajat, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service.\\n\\nLooking forward, we foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced for Oasis.app, in particular, and DeFi stablecoin uses in general. The use of collateral to reduce volatility and other risks is making decentralized finance accessible to more people. Push notifications will be essential to enable future Oasis.app users to take advantage of the best collateralization and liquidation rates. Thus, we view decentralized push notifications as an important service that will accelerate the mass adoption of DeFi. Since Oasis.app is at the forefront of creating a unified stablecoin-powered DeFi hub, we expect our partnership to yield many new useful notification services and features for the decentralized finance market.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of Oasis.app. DeFi users \u2014 who can easily integrate the EPNS protocol into their wallet \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service. Going forward, we also plan to work closely with Oasis.app users to create new messaging solutions to meet their evolving push notification needs.\\n\\nWe are pleased to be partnering with Oasis.app and anticipate EPNS push notifications becoming an indispensable tool in stablecoin DeFi markets.\\n\\n## About Oasis.app\\n\\nOasis.app is the home for everything you want to accomplish with Dai. A decentralized application that runs on the Ethereum blockchain, Oasis aims to be the most trusted app to access the Maker protocol, get Dai and in general to deploy your capital into DeFi. Dai is a better, smarter digital currency for everyone. It is the world\u2019s first unbiased currency and its value consistently tracks the US Dollar, which means it doesn\u2019t suffer from the volatility associated with many other digital currencies.\\n\\nLearn more and stay in touch with the team: [Blog](https://blog.oasis.app/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oasisdotapp), [Discord](http://discord.gg/Kc2bBB59GC)"},{"id":"welcome-on-board-sandeep","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/welcome-on-board-sandeep","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-13-welcome-on-board-sandeep/index.md","title":"Welcome on board, Sandeep","description":"Welcome on board, Sandeep","date":"2021-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 13, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Annoucements","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/annoucements"},{"label":"Advisor","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/advisor"},{"label":"Polygon","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/polygon"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"}],"readingTime":1.1533333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome-on-board-sandeep","title":"Welcome on board, Sandeep","description":"Welcome on board, Sandeep","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We at EPNS are thrilled to announce that Sandeep Nailwal, Co-Founder of Polygon will be joining EPNS as an Advisor.","tags":["Annoucements","Advisor","Polygon","Ethereum","Blockchain"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EPNS Push Notifications Arrive at DeFi on Oasis.app","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-push-notifications-arrive-at-defi"},"nextItem":{"title":"TrueFi Taking DeFi to New Horizons with EPNS","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/truefi-taking-defi-to-new"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover Image of Welcome on board, Sandeep](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWe at EPNS are thrilled to announce that [Sandeep Nailwal](https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal), Co-Founder of Polygon will be joining EPNS as an Advisor.\\n\\nSandeep is the Co-Founder & COO of [Polygon](https://twitter.com/0xPolygon) (previously Matic Network), an Ethereum scaling infrastructure that is looking to make Ethereum a multi-chain system aka the Internet of Blockchains.\\n\\nHe is also the founder and instigator of India\u2019s [CryptoRelief](https://twitter.com/cryptorelief_) Campaign, which has raked in more than $450 million dollars worth of donations at the time of writing.\\n\\nSandeep was one of the earliest backers of EPNS.

Thanks to the powerful composability of Ethereum, new solutions emerge quickly, and enable more people to participate in this financial revolution. When it comes to loans, collateralized and uncollateralized loans have attracted new kinds of players to the DeFi space.\\n\\nWith the mutual goal to grow this exciting space, we are thrilled to announce that we are working with [TrueFi](https://truefi.io/) to develop the core EPNS protocol. TrueFi is a team with a notable trajectory building cutting-edge products for Web3, and we are looking forward to working with the team to refine the EPNS protocol to create sustainable, decentralized notifications.\\n\\nOur pilot program with TrueFi will consist of:\\n\\n- Creating a standard for the TrueFi platform that will enable sending notifications based on predefined thresholds and conditions.\\n- For borrowers: Notifications around when rates are changing and when their existing loans are coming due\\n- For stakers and lenders: Creating a communication channel to keep token holders aware of new loan requests that require voting and provide stakers with a fast and efficient way to go to the app and vote for/against a loan.\\n- Working with the TrueFi team to enable technical discussion towards building the decentralized communication layer that is scalable and powerful.\\n\\nTrueFi brings a new concept to the DeFi scene with the idea to attract major industry players and institutions as borrowers looking to secure high-value long term loans. We are grateful to be partnering with one of the most innovative teams in the space to help take DeFi beyond.\\n\\n## **About TrueFi**\\n\\nTrueFi is a DeFi Protocol for on-chain, unsecured lending, which allows earning high yields on stablecoin loans and borrowing capital without collateral.

These people have lent us their time and their knowledge to support our growth and our journey to provide the core notification layer for the decentralized economy. Thank you to each and every one of them!\\n\\n![First= Image of EPNS Ends H1 2021 with 25 Collaborations and $118m Volume on Uniswap](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nSo far this year, the most critical event for EPNS was our token generation event (TGE) and Polkastarter IDO in April. A lot of pre-work went into that event, however \u2014 and we spent the first few months of the year laying down some foundations for the EPNS protocol.\\n\\n**Developer Tooling:** We continued to develop our SDKs, [Subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/epnsproject/epnsprod), new back-end infrastructure support, and more tools for the developers to build faster and better integrations with EPNS.\\n\\n**Staging Environment:** Have you checked out our staging environment? If not, you should \u2014 it\u2019s where much of the fun happens. Throughout the past 6 months, we\u2019ve been adding quick access to additional resources to better help people onboard themselves to the EPNS protocol, including: DAI minter, Ropsten Faucets, app download links (Android & iOS), quick access to documentation material, and more.\\n\\n**Channels:** EPNS lets anyone subscribe to channels that deliver them notifications based on customizable actions that occur on-chain, lettering users stay on top of their addresses and dApp activity like liquidation warnings in DeFi. We\u2019ve spent time this year rolling out a lot of\\n\\n**Chrome Extension:** Recently, we announced the arrival of EPNS Chrome Browser Extension Alpha v0.1! The EPNS Chrome Browser extension is now LIVE in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/epns-protocol-alpha/lbdcbpaldalgiieffakjhiccoeebchmg/).\\n\\n# The $PUSH Token Launch\\n\\nIn April, we celebrated one of our largest milestones to date: the $PUSH token generation event. $PUSH is the native token to the EPNS protocol [\u2014 to learn more, see here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-token-economics-d7f566c29b1a).\\n\\nThe TGE began with our IDO on Polkastarter. During the IDO, we raised over 44 ETH from over 400 participants. Later that day after the Polkastarter IDO, $PUSH went live on Uniswap, and permissionless trading began. Just a couple of days later, we announced our listing on WazirX, India\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\\n\\nTo date, $PUSH has $118m in volume on Uniswap with over 3,000 on chain token holders \u2014 also securing a spot in the top 150 token pairs. We\u2019ve also listed on MEXC \u2014 with more exciting announcements to come!\\n\\nTo learn more about the TGE and the token distribution of $PUSH, [see here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/announcing-the-epns-push-token-generation-event-4d1699e716f5).\\n\\n# Ecosystem Collaborations\\n\\nWe see so many opportunities for notifications in the Web3 ecosystem. Especially following our TGE, we started collaborating with leading protocols in the blockchain space to help them scope, create, and test those opportunities for their platforms ahead of our mainnet launch. We\u2019ve announced _over 25 collaborations_ in 2021, including:\\n\\n- [Aave](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-collaborates-with-aave-to-bring-push-notifications-to-aave-users-3cdd7baf38e0)\\n- [Uniswap](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/accelerating-defi-with-epns-f2cbfaa33c91)\\n- [Gitcoin](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/gitcoin-growing-open-source-using-web3-notifs-36a9ec6e97dc)\\n- [Polygon](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/scaling-web3notifs-on-polygons-layer-2-100e19e3269d) (prev.

Our rewards program offers a total of 5,510,000 $PUSH to be distributed during the program, which ends on 15th March 2023.\\n\\nThe incentives website launched with two pools: The PUSH Staking Pool, and the Uniswap LP Pool, allowing users to participate in yield farming and liquidity mining opportunities and enjoy great APYs.\\n\\nLearn more about EPNS Rewards and $PUSH Incentives [here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-liquidity-rewards-program-d16ff2c0fef4).\\n\\n# Community\\n\\nWhere would we be without our community? Answer: not very far. We spent a lot of the past six months finding as many opportunities as we could to thank you for all the support you\u2019ve shown us. A portion of our TGE airdropped funds to early users of the protocol \u2014 i.e. those who stuck with us through the bugs to help us arrive at the best product for Web3 notifications.\\n\\nAfter our token release, we announced the [Rockstars of EPNS NFT gratitude program](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf). For the next year following the token launch, we are distributing 1 NFT and 2,400 $PUSH to one community member a week who demonstrates their support of the EPNS protocol. So far, we\u2019ve seen memes, videos, documentation recommendations, and more submitted on Twitter and are blown away by the support and creativity of the community.\\n\\nKeep rocking on \ud83e\udd18\\n\\n# Looking Ahead\\n\\nWe\u2019re ecstatic about all we\u2019ve achieved this year, but we know there\u2019s so much more to do to bring about the community\u2019s vision for a notification layer of Web3. One of our biggest communication efforts this year was the [**2021 EPNS Roadmap**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12), which we published in April following the TGE. The Roadmap lays out our plans for Q3 and Q4 of this year, letting the community know what\u2019s in the pipeline.\\n\\nAnd what\u2019s the most exciting part of the roadmap? In our opinion, it\u2019s the impending mainnet launch of the EPNS protocol. After months and months of testnet tinkering, we\u2019re excited to officially bring notifications to the Web3 ecosystem, and work with our collaborators to offer better communication to their users.\\n\\nMainnet is so exciting \u2026but wait!! let\u2019s also talk push nodes which will make L2s communication a reality\u2026 and the fact that they can theoretically support other blockchains (even non-evm ones) is a PoC which we all want to see happening! Onwards to infinity and beyond!\\n\\nMuch \ud83d\udc95, from us to you!\\n\\nThe EPNS Team"},{"id":"introducing-the-epns-chrome-browser-extension-alpha","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/introducing-the-epns-chrome-browser-extension-alpha","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-02-introducing-the-chrome-browser-extension-alpha/index.md","title":"Roadmap Q2: Introducing the EPNS Chrome Browser Extension Alpha v0.1","description":"Roadmap Q2: Introducing the EPNS Chrome Browser Extension Alpha v0.1","date":"2021-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 2, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Roadmap","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/roadmap"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"}],"readingTime":1.1666666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"introducing-the-epns-chrome-browser-extension-alpha","title":"Roadmap Q2: Introducing the EPNS Chrome Browser Extension Alpha v0.1","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Roadmap Q2: Introducing the EPNS Chrome Browser Extension Alpha v0.1","text":"Since its inception, EPNS has been on its mission to build the most effective and reliable communication layer on Web3 to allow sending platform-agnostic and decentralized notifications.","tags":["Ethereum","Blockchain","Web3","Roadmap","Newsletter"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EPNS Ends H1 2021 with 25 Collaborations and $118m Volume on Uniswap","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-ends-h1-2021"},"nextItem":{"title":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-monthly-blocks-jun-30"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover Image of Roadmap Q2: Introducing the EPNS Chrome Browser Extension Alpha v0.1](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWe are thrilled to announce the arrival of <b>EPNS Chrome Browser Extension Alpha v0.1!</b>\\n\\n[Part of our Q2 2021 Roadmap](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12) was to extend the outreach of decentralized notifications to more platforms outside mobile and this extension allows users to do exactly that, ie: get notifications from Web3 without visiting dApps to check your actions!\\n\\n<blockquote>\\nNote: Currently it\u2019s recommended for developers and advance users to install the extension via our git.

Multiple factors such as the involvement of institutional investors, the spiking prices of cryptos, and the evolution of DeFi are majorly impacting the adoption. The latest in the series of things taking crypto to greater heights is the popularity of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens.\\n\\nNFTs are now everywhere, from art to digital collectibles and real estate to gaming. In March alone, users spent over $440 million on these tokens across various NFT platforms. Just yesterday Twitter announced 140 NFT drop \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nSo, what exactly are NFTs?\\n\\n# What are NFTs?\\n\\nThe term \u201cfungible\u201d is used to identify items that can easily replace or be replaced by other identical items without any change in value. Going by this, we can say fiat currencies such as the dollar or cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ether are fungible items or tokens.\\n\\nFor example, you can easily exchange one Bitcoin for another Bitcoin without any change in value. You can also do the same with a dollar. Or, you may exchange a $100 bill with 20 bills of $5. This means a Bitcoin or a dollar bill does not have anything particularly unique that sets them apart from other Bitcoins or dollar bills. Thus, they are fungible items.\\n\\nNow, consider an art piece by Picasso. Can you replace the original art piece with any other art representing the exact same details and value? Not really. Sure, you may recreate the painting, but there will only ever be one original artwork that will always possess a unique value. This characteristic not only makes Picasso\u2019s artwork but every artwork by every artist non-fungible as they\u2019re each unique in their own way.\\n\\nEven your house is non-fungible. You may buy a new house or exchange your house with that of your friend\u2019s, but you are not entirely replacing it with the new house. Why? Because the location of the new house, its design, the number of rooms, and so many other details of it will be completely different from your existing one.\\n\\nWe can go further with examples of unique and rare items that are non-fungible. Music albums, in-game accessories, digital and real collectibles, and so on. And when we take these non-fungible items and represent their uniqueness through blockchain-based digital tokens pegged to the items, they become non-fungible tokens.\\n\\n# What\u2019s All the Hype Around NFTs?\\n\\nThe fad around NFTs is fuelled by two distinct reasons. The first is the technical excellence they offer to the art, gaming, music, real estate, and so many other industries. The second is that many renowned artists, celebrities, tech entrepreneurs, and business owners have joined the NFT bandwagon. Let\u2019s look into both.\\n\\nThe fact that NFTs are stored on a blockchain makes them extremely secure. If you own the NFT pegged to a Picasso, you actually have the proof-of-ownership of the painting that is based on a blockchain. And blockchains are cryptographically secure, distributed ledgers that make it next to impossible for anyone to tamper with a record stored on it. This means, no one can hack a blockchain to steal your NFT or tamper with it.\\n\\nAdditionally, blockchains are also transparent, public ledgers, and all records are publicly available. So you can easily check who has previously owned the NFT of the Picasso painting and verify its authenticity. This has the potential to curb the sale of counterfeit products in the art and luxury goods industries, which currently cuts losses worth billions of dollars annually.\\n\\nBut that\u2019s certainly not it. Famous people from digital artists like Beeple to technologists like Elon Musk and entrepreneurs like Jack Dorsey are all now involved in the world of NFTs.\\n\\nRecently, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey put his first-ever tweet from 2006 up for sale as an NFT. The NFT of the tweet that reads \u201cjust setting up my twttr\u201d [was sold for $2.9 million](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/twitter-boss-jack-dorseys-first-175023852.html). Even [Elon Musk created](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/03/15/elon-musk-is-selling-a-song-as-nft/) an animated music video about NFTs with an NFT song that he intended to sell as an NFT. He received bids worth millions of dollars but [later ditched the idea of selling](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/367346) it.\\n\\nIf all that makes your jaw drop, wait for the biggest one.\\n\\nThe NFT of a digital art piece by Mike Winkelmann, famously known as Beeple, recently [sold for over $69 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/arts/design/christies-beeple-nft.html). It was a collage of 5,000 of the digital artworks that he had posted online daily since 2013. The sale made it the third most expensive artwork ever sold by a living artist.\\n\\nAs you read this, [celebrities are creating NFTs](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/nft-celebrity-non-fungible-tokens-crypto-grimes-paris-hilton/) of their own. [NBA already has NFTs](https://dappradar.com/flow/collectibles/nba-topshot) that bring basketball to the world of blockchain. And yet, it only feels like the start\u2026 a massive one.\\n\\n# Bringing Push Notifications to NFT Marketplaces\\n\\nThere are two popular ways you can get your hands on NFTs \u2014 centralized and decentralized marketplaces. One of the most popular centralized marketplaces is Nifty Gateway. It makes the process easy by allowing you to use your credit card to purchase NFTs. But as with all things centralized, it is exposed to cyber threats, which is quite evident after the [recent hack of the platform](https://www.coindesk.com/nifty-gateway-nft-hack-lessons).\\n\\nSo, your safest bet is a decentralized NFT marketplace like OpenSea, where you truly own the NFTs you buy. And as they are decentralized, no one can really hack them or exploit your account unless you somehow compromise the private keys and passwords to your wallet.\\n\\nHowever, like mobile applications from the early days of smartphones, these marketplaces still do not have push notifications. Now, suppose you use OpenSea to buy and trade NFTs. Of course, you would love to stay updated about the latest NFT sales and new NFT listings. Maybe, when you put an NFT up for sale, you would want to be notified when it gets a new bidder. The scenarios for the use of push notifications are endless.\\n\\nSadly, decentralized platforms today cannot send push notifications to keep you notified of the latest events. That, however, changes with Ethereum Push Notification Service or EPNS. EPNS not only enables decentralized applications and services to send push notifications to their users but also incentivizes the entire process for users. This creates a win-win situation for everyone in the ecosystem.\\n\\nAs we move further deep into the world of NFTs and decentralized marketplaces become a common hangout place for NFT fans, push notifications will become inevitable. And as that happens, we are sure EPNS will be able to effectively solve the challenge at hand."},{"id":"epns-showrunners-framework-and-backend-sdk-beta","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-showrunners-framework-and-backend-sdk-beta","source":"@site/blog/2021-06-25-epns-showrunners-framework-and-backend-sdk-beta/index.md","title":"Roadmap Q2: EPNS Showrunners Framework and Backend SDK Beta v1.0 are Live!","description":"Roadmap Q2: EPNS Showrunners Framework and Backend SDK Beta v1.0 are Live!","date":"2021-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 25, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Roadmap","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/roadmap"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/newsletter"}],"readingTime":1.4333333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-showrunners-framework-and-backend-sdk-beta","title":"Roadmap Q2: EPNS Showrunners Framework and Backend SDK Beta v1.0 are Live!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","description":"Roadmap Q2: EPNS Showrunners Framework and Backend SDK Beta v1.0 are Live!","text":"We are thrilled to announce the release of two new open-source EPNS tools to enhance the integration and implementation of EPNS Decentralized Notifications within your dApps and protocols, the EPNS Backend SDK Beta v1.0 and the EPNS Showrunners Framework; two of our most anticipated roadmap milestones for Q2.","tags":["Roadmap","Blockchain","Ethereum","Notifications","Newsletter"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Understanding NFTs and Why We Need Push Notifications on NFT Marketplaces","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/understanding-nfts"},"nextItem":{"title":"EPNS Collaborates with Aave to Bring Push Notifications to Aave Users","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-collaborates-with-aave-to-bring"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover Image of Roadmap Q2: EPNS Showrunners Framework and Backend SDK Beta v1.0 are Live!](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWe are thrilled to announce the release of two new open-source EPNS tools to enhance the integration and implementation of EPNS Decentralized Notifications within your dApps and protocols, the EPNS Backend SDK Beta v1.0 and the EPNS Showrunners Framework; two of our most anticipated roadmap milestones for Q2.\\n\\nMore detailed information can be found on our [Roadmap 2021 blog post](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12).\\n\\n### Showrunners Framework in short\\n\\n- Allows developers & protocols to send decentralized notifications with custom logic to EPNS Protocol from backend servers.\\n- Includes a highly customizable scheduling engine that allows for setting up recurrent verifications to trigger notifications.\\n- This framework relies entirely on the EPNS Backend SDK explained below.

We aimed for having 4-5 projects and to get them involved but were blown away by the love and reception given to us by over 25+ project with whom we are running the pilot program of EPNS.\\n\\n![First Image of Roadmap Q2: Strategic Collabs and what we did so far with them!](./image-1.webp)\\n<ImageText>Meet Frens of EPNS</ImageText>\\n\\nWith them, we were able to put EPNS to test, and make sure what we are building is aligned to protocols needs now and in the foreseeable future. Let\u2019s look at the great progress we made with few of different Projects and what we learned from them.\\n\\n#### Uniswap\\n\\nWith Uniswap we implemented EPNS decentralized notifications to let users know when a new proposal is submitted.\\n\\n![Second Image of Roadmap Q2: Strategic Collabs and what we did so far with them!](./image-2.gif)\\n\\nBy making use of the Call to Action feature users will be able to go directly to the proposal with 1 click.\\n\\nIn this case we hooked directly with Uniswap\u2019s V2 contracts.\\n\\nCurrently, we are exploring implementing EPNS for more use cases available with V3 including sending notifs when the LP provider range of trading curve goes out, ie: they are unable to earn any fees.\\n\\n#### Aave\\n\\nWith Aave we had the opportunity for the first time to put EPNS to test looking at events happening in Polygon and sending notifications directly to wallet addresses.\\n\\n![Third Image of Roadmap Q2: Strategic Collabs and what we did so far with them!](./image-3.gif)\\n\\nWith this integration users are notified whenever the Health Factor representing the safety of their loans is reaching a low level.\\n\\nIn this case, the goal is using EPNS decentralized notifications to help protect user\u2019s assets in case they are in risk.\\n\\n#### Alpha Homora\\n\\nWith Alpha Homora we created a channel to which users can opt-in to receive notifications about their loan positions when they reach a risky level.\\n\\n![Fourth Image of Roadmap Q2: Strategic Collabs and what we did so far with them!](./image-4.gif)\\n\\nCurrently, the threshold is defined programmatically as this implementation relies on our Showrunners framework.\\n\\nWorking on this case gave us food for thought, and developed into internal brainstorming sessions to understand how to address some settings like this via the protocol.\\n\\n#### TrueFi\\n\\nWith TrueFi we worked on a solution to notify users when new loans are available for voting, and also to alert users when their loans are coming due.\\n\\n![Fifth Image of Roadmap Q2: Strategic Collabs and what we did so far with them!](./image-5.gif)\\n\\nImplementing this channel allowed us to use our Protocol in a different way, observing a dynamic list of contracts that can grow depending on the platform usage.\\n\\nWorking on this case also gave us the opportunity to learn new ways to optimize our protocol.\\n\\n### Milestone Learnings\\n\\nThis important milestone in our roadmap comes packed with lots of lessons learned and important facts & experiences that reassured to us that we are doing things right.\\n\\nWhile most of our features were validated, we also had the opportunity to adjust and even pivot into different direction some of our protocol features.\\n\\n### Protocol Features Update\\n\\n#### Protocol Settings\\n\\nWith AAVE Loan Liquidation, we understood the importance of deep customizations of a user setting for a particular channel.\\n\\n#### Indirect Subscribe\\n\\nWe are pivoting indirect subscribe from a service without user consent to now a spam box feature where in channels can send notifications to user wallets but if the user hasn\u2019t opted in to receive those notifications then it will not be shown as a push notification to the user and will land in their unauthorized box, think how twitter deals with DMs that you haven\u2019t accepted.\\n\\n#### Delegation of Channel Controls\\n\\nWorking with top DeFi projects made us realize that channel can\u2019t be only controlled by one wallet address as there might be few different owners of that channel (think co-founders or people assigned that responsibility). With that in mind, we also introduced delegation of channel controls and the ability to send notifications on channel behalf from other wallets.\\n\\n#### Verified Badges\\n\\nWe also realized that not all channels would be created with good intentions and wanted the frontend discovery dApp of ours to have that ability which will be done via verified badges that can be handed by us to verified channels and those verified channels can even hand over verification to others. This ensures that the Frontend is able to distinguish useful channels if the user wants to filter them out but at the same time ensures web3 ethos are taken care of.\\n\\n#### What\'s coming next?\\n\\nWe originally started this Pilot Program Collaborations with the goal of learning and spreading the word about EPNS with a handful of teams. We end this quarter amazed and humbled with the response received, as reached a list of more than 25 projects looking to work with us to implement EPNS decentralized notifications for their use cases.\\n\\nWe want to finish with a big thank you to our community and the teams working and about to work with us .

The channel has passed an initial validation from the EPNS side, and we will soon be working on adjustments and improvements based on Uniswap\u2019s team feedback.\\n\\n![Second Image](./image-2.gif)\\n\\n- [**Clr.fund**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/advancing-clr-fund-funding-protocol-with-web3notifs-366b61408aa3): to notify users regarding events like rounds starting/finalizing, when contributions are received, when funds claimed, and when a tally is published. This channel is currently in development, and we are working closely with the CLR.fund team to speed up the process.\\n- [**Alpha Homora**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/we-alpha-homora-innovations-in-defi-with-epns-3873f74dc48): to notify users about upcoming liquidations of leveraged positions. We are working against the latest version of the AH contracts, and the channel will be ready for testing soon.\\n- Surprise channel announcement soon \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n## Collaboration announcements\\n\\n- With [**Ceramic Network**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/advancing-ceramic-networks-decentralized-identity-network-with-epns-264b24a7508f) to explore sending notifications through a user\u2019s DID.\\n- With [**bZx**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-partners-with-bzx-to-deliver-crucial-margin-trading-push-notifications-to-wallets-a2f52e4fcefe) to send margin lending and trading notifications directly to bZx user wallets.\\n- With [**Unilend**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-partners-with-unilend-finance-to-deliver-notifications-for-permissionless-money-markets-e647300b68ce) to notify users about new tokens listings, status of swap and spot trades, governance proposals, airdrops, and when a Flash Loan goes through.\\n- With [**Charged Particles**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/advancing-charged-particles-interest-bearing-nfts-with-epns-dc5643325300) to notify users about NFT deposits, interest earned and more actions in the Charged Particles platform.\\n- With [**YAM Finance**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/bringing-power-of-web3notif-to-the-awesome-yam-community-95d8a39ed86c) to notify users about liquidation risks, and governance actions.\\n- With [**PlotX**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-partners-with-plotx-to-bring-push-notifications-to-defi-prediction-markets-6b63952d46f6) to send all prediction market trading notifications directly to PlotX user wallets.\\n\\n## Completing EPNS Protocol v1\\n\\n- Full protocol test cases coverage is in the code review stage.\\n- Adding capabilities to delegate other wallets to Send Notifications on behalf of a channel.\\n- Ensuring upgradeability capabilities.\\n\\n## Backend SDKs\\n\\nThis is currently a work in progress for our team. We have been taking into consideration not only what we had planned since the start of the year, but also all the feedback and questions received from the community mostly through our Discord server. We are aiming to release an npm package that will allow developers to easily interface with the EPNS protocol to perform its most basic set of functions, starting with Sending Notifications in all its flavors.\\n\\n## Browser Extension\\n\\nThis is also a work in progress. The goal is to release an initial version of a Browser Extension that will allow end-users to easily set up their wallets to receive notifications (through a guided wizard). Once the wallet is configured, users will know when new notifications arrive and will be able to go to the dApp with 1-click.\\n\\n# Other Highlights\\n\\n- Our **Rockstar of Ethereum** latest episodes with [Nischal Shetty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiPGqggzoZ4) and [Anthony Sassano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCL4w7vnFfM&t=3s) are live!\\n- **Featured by:** [The Defiant: $PUSH farming tutorial](https://thedefiant.io/defiant-degens-how-to-farm-in-defis-first-protocol-for-push-notifications/), [dApp.com](https://www.dapp.com/article/3-utility-dapps-on-ethereum), [Interview by CryptoRand](https://cryptorandgroup.com/interview-with-epns/), [Report by Delphi Digital](https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/push-vs-pull/), [Coinmonks](https://medium.com/coinmonks/defi-on-web-3-0-creates-more-earnings-opportunities-e8cc676ccc3b), [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/margin-trading-accounts-how-decentralized-notifications-increase-borrowing-power-e7p34qj), [dapp.com](https://www.dapp.com/article/3-utility-dapps-on-ethereum) and we are now on Zapper.fi!\\n- **Blog Posts**: Make sure to take a look at our [EPNS FAQ](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-faqs-21062505f479)\\n- **AMA:** [EPNS Community AMA](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-community-ama-recap-60cf5d4e555f), AMA Lovers Club, Crypto Talkz, [AMA with PlotX](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1397738325688029188?s=20), TheLAO Community AMA.\\n\\nThis month we want to leave you with one of our favorite and most liked tweet of the month: [Meet Frens of EPNS \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1395794479764836357?s=20)\\n\\nIt reflects in many ways how lucky and grateful we are to be in this amazing space at the right moment and at the right time.\\n\\nCheers!\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1395794479764836357&amp;image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"786\\" width=\\"1006\\" title=\\"Ethereum Push Notification Service | EPNS on Twitter: &quot;1/\ud83c\udf89Let\'s celebrate!

To upgrade prediction markets to a professional trading tool, EPNS is pleased to announce the launch of a pilot program to provide decentralized push notifications to the users of PlotX \u2014 a cross-chain prediction market protocol for crypto-assets.\\n\\n# Why is PlotX Partnering with EPNS?\\n\\nPlotX enables crypto-asset predictions, like _\u201cWhat will be the price of BTC/USDT in the next 1 hour?\u201d_\\n\\nCrypto traders are able to make price predictions of top crypto assets in hourly, daily and weekly timeframes.\\n\\nPlotX v2 Mainnet was launched on 14th May, 2021, and within a week more than 1,000 markets have been created, 6.5k+ predictions have been made and over 500k PLOT have been utilized to make predictions.\\n\\nGiven the traction on the platform already, PlotX has identified that traders require a push notification service to take timely advantage of the trading opportunities without compromising on the non-custodial nature of the application.\\n\\n> _Providing the simplest, non-custodial experience of making predictions has always been a top priority for us ever since we started building the app in Feb 2020. With PlotX v2 we doubled down on our focus on UX and collaborating with EPNS is another step in that direction. It will enable our users to stay abreast of all the trading opportunities and never miss a prediction on PlotX v2._\\n>\\n> _\u2014 Ish Goel, Co-founder, PlotX_\\n\\nDue to the simplicity of its design, users often call it the Uniswap of Prediction Markets. UX has been a big focus of the app development as can be seen in their v2 Mainnet release with features such as gasless predictions, multiple new & exciting markets, cross chain swaps etc all making the app extremely exciting and easy to use for their users.\\n\\nDecentralized notifications will help traders to fully benefit from oracle price feeds, new markets (hourly, daily & weekly), rewards distribution, and other important in-app events. This will allow users to stay within the ecosystem of the prediction market, without relying on any other platform for market updates.\\n\\nCurrently, PlotX users are reliant on Telegram, Twitter & Discord to receive market alerts.\\n\\n# The EPNS Solution\\n\\nThe EPNS decentralized push notification service sends timely notifications through a single source of communication, the investor\u2019s wallet. All notifications go directly to the trader\u2019s wallet where they can take immediate action. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet. The partnership benefits to PlotX users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all prediction market trading notifications directly to PlotX user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and PlotX teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the various push notification needs of DeFi prediction market users.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different prediction market trading and investment products.\\n\\n# How EPNS is planning to support PlotX in achieving the objective?\\n\\nUnder this pilot program, EPNS is building a dedicated channel for PlotX (see our lightpaper for definitions of channels, services, and more). PlotX users can subscribe to the PlotX channel to receive customized notifications to their wallets. Through collaboration with the PlotX team, we will gain insight into the push notification needs of users of DeFi prediction markets and what they want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\n> Notifying users about every phase of the prediction market is crucial for user engagement and adoption \u2014 new predictions, market fluctuations and market closing etc. Our partnership with PlotX will help bridge the gap between markets and its users, opening up multitude new uses cases for both protocol and users alike.\\n>\\n> \u2014 Harsh Rajat, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service\\n\\nLooking forward, we foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced as prediction markets become a key price forecasting and trading tool in DeFi. As the prediction market matures, push notifications will be essential to enabling future PlotX features like the decentralized positions trading exchange where users will be able to trade their positions with other users and liquidate their positions before they expire. Since PlotX is at the forefront of these innovative services, we expect our partnership to yield many new useful notification services and features.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of PlotX. Users \u2014 who can easily integrate the EPNS protocol into a wallet \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service. Going forward, we also expect to work closely with PlotX users creating their own prediction market DAOs to meet their evolving push notification needs.\\n\\nWe are pleased to be partnering with the PlotX prediction market platform and anticipate EPNS push notifications becoming an indispensable tool in DeFi prediction markets.\\n\\n# About PlotX\\n\\nPlotX is a cross-chain Prediction Market protocol built by the ex-CTO of Nexus Mutual (>$900m mcap).\\n\\nMarkets are focused on the most exciting crypto-assets like BTC, ETH, MATIC, BNB, DOGE & SHIB and are automatically created in intervals of 1 hour, 1 day and 1 week.\\n\\nDubbed as the Uniswap of Prediction Markets due to its simplicity, PlotX uses an Automated Market-Making algorithm to settle markets and distribute rewards without counterparty risk.\\n\\nThe PlotX v2 Mainnet was launched on the Polygon Network on 14th May with a multitude of interesting features like gasless prediction experience. The v2 app has seen significant traction from crypto traders since launch.\\n\\nStay in touch!

The 4 best questions will be selected.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc65 **Harsh Rajat- Founder, Richa Joshi- Marketing Lead and Jafett Sandi- Dev Lead at EPNS are here with us to answer your questions.**\\n\\nSo, without further ado, Let\u2019s get this show on the road!\\n\\nHarsh @harshr, Richa @RJlwl and Jafett @JafCR can you please introduce yourselves and go over your backgrounds so everyone in here gets to know you better? \ud83d\udc4f\\n\\nHarsh: Hey Awesome Community!\\n\\nFeels a bit weird to intro in our community but here goes\u2026 I am Harsh, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service. Some background about me, I love dabbling in all things tech; and have been fortunate enough to have the support from the awesome Ethereum and blockchain community to have been given the chance to create/change the communication layer for Ethereum and Web3, which we like to call as **The Missing Piece of Web3.0**.\\n\\nRicha: Sure. Hey Awesome peeps, I\u2019m Richa, co-founder of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS). I wear multiple hats at EPNS though am focused on mostly Marketing, Growth and Product. Stoked to be #BUIDLing World\u2019s First Decentralized Notification Protocol. Looking forward to some awesome questions today \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude4c\\n\\nJaf: Hi everyone! Super excited to join this AMA today! \u270c\ud83c\udffe\\n\\nI am Jaf, Product and Development Lead at Ethereum Push Notification Service.\\n\\nI love living in the intersection of Technology, Product, and Users; and having the opportunity to participate in building the World\u2019s first protocol for Web3Notifs is a true challenge and a true pleasure. So many things are coming, it\u2019s going to be quite a ride!\\n\\nJai: Thank you so much for the introduction. \u2708\ufe0f I am already impressed haha!\\n\\nRicha: haha \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\nJai: Let\u2019s start with the SEGMENT 1\u20e3\\n\\n**In SEGMENT 1\u20e3: I will ask to the team some introductory questions about EPNS. Are you set @harshr @RJlwl @JafCR ?**\\n\\nRicha: GIF \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d\\n\\nJaf: Lets do it! \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\n**Jai: Question1\u20e3: Hi @harshr, can you explain to us what is EPNS and how did you come up with the idea? What is your overall vision with EPNS?**\\n\\nHarsh: Sure.\\n\\nEthereum Push Notifications Service aka EPNS is communication middleware for blockchain that enables any smart contracts, dApps or Web3 service to send notifications to wallet addresses.\\n\\n**The idea in TLDR;** The idea for EPNS occurred when we sat down to observe what, if any, pain points still existed among blockchain apps (dApps / smart contracts / services) that we could solve. We were quick to realize that something felt a bit odd, but took some time to realize that Web3 tech behaved a lot like the early days of the internet.\\n\\nThat drastically changed after 2010 when Apple and then Google came with push notifs and after that for Web2.0, Notifications have engraved into our lives, so much so that we hardly realize most of our online actions are caused by them; think about it, whatsapp, facetime, emails, payments, games all inform you now. You don\u2019t go back to them to see if something has happened.\\n\\nContrast this experience with any dApps, smart contracts or services you interact with on Web3. There\u2019s no way to inform users (wallet addresses) any time an important event occurs. Instead, the user is assumed to go back to the service time and time again to check their activity.\\n\\nFor instance, Liquidation on AAVE, Compound or any DeFi, DAO Governance proposal (Yam!), or ENS / dEx orders. Each of these are a reality right now but no solution exists to address them and the problem will only worsen as more services come to Web3. This was the moment that we realized that we are in the stone age era of communication in blockchain and we need to do something about it!\\n\\n**Actual TLDR:** Our vision for EPNS is to build the communication pillar of Ethereum and Web 3.0!\\n\\nDone!\\n\\nJai: That sounds really great Harsh! \ud83d\udc4f Let\u2019s move onto the next Question.\\n\\n**Q2\ufe0f\u20e3: How exactly does EPNS work and why is there a need for EPNS in the Blockchain space?**\\n\\nJaf: Thank you. I\u2019ll take this one!\\n\\nJai: Sure, I am pretty sure our community members would love to know about it.\\n\\nJaf: To paint a high level picture \u2014 EPNS Core functionality can be divided into three big areas:\\n\\n**EPNS Protocol (Send Notifications)**\\n\\nProtocols looking to send Web3 notifications will have to create message payloads that are compliant with the EPNS protocol standards. By following the rules, protocols will be able to successfully call our smart contracts, which will allow the notification to be picked up and delivered.\\n\\n**PUSH Nodes (Retrieval & Dispatch)**\\n\\nThese nodes will be listening to events in the EPNS smart contract to retrieve notifications, process them, and make sure they are delivered to the appropriate recipients.\\n\\n**Governance of EPNS Protocol**\\n\\nThis will enable token holders to participate in the direction of the protocol, allowing them to control upgrades and receive incentives for participating in the protocol.\\n\\nHaving these pieces properly working together empowers us to create a set of different products around them. Such as:\\n\\n\\\\- dApp, Mobile App, Browser Extension\\n\\n\\\\- **Tooling for Developers**: Front-end/Back-end SDK, Mobile SDK, Subgraphs\\n\\n\\\\- **Showrunner channels** with more customizations for better user experiences.\\n\\nNow, a service wanting to send notifications to their subscribers will create a Channel (similarly to a channel in Youtube). From the channel UI section in our dApp the service will have the opportunity to send highly customizable notifications to a specific recipient or as a broadcast to the entire list of subscribers.\\n\\nTo understand why notifications are needed, just compare how our daily Web2 life is driven by notifications \u2014 your amazon delivery, bank account related info, payments, even Facetime calls are driven by notification. Now comparing it to Web3, there is no way by which Web3 services can communicate with their users about critical events:\\n\\n- Loan liquidation on Alpha Homora, Compound, and other DeFi protocols.\\n- Your trade gets executed on a DEX, or if your Limit order was filled.\\n- New governance proposal is issued.\\n- New Limited Edition NFT is about to drop.\\n- Winning a PoolTogether lottery.\\n- New features and upgrades to a protocol\\n\\nDone!\\n\\nJai: Now this is indeed really interesting @JafCR \u2708\ufe0f\\n\\nThank you for the answer. My next Question is from @RJlwl \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n**Question3\ufe0f\u20e3: A lot has happened in the past 30 days \u2014 Successful public sale, listings, partnerships, development, interviews, NFT community drops etc. How about we explain some of this stuff?**\\n\\nRicha: Sure! First off, we can\u2019t thank the EPNS community enough for supporting and sharing their valuable feedback with us in this journey. We are very grateful for all the love we have gotten, so thank you for each and every one of you \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude4f\\n\\nThe past 30 days have been superb. \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n- After the TGE, our **Polkastarter IDO** was a huge success and post which we listed on **Uniswap**, **Paraswap** and **WazirX** India.\\n- We announced our gratitude to early backers (48 NFTs) and community members (52 NFTs/ week) by announcing **ROCKSTAR NFT**s. Very happy to share that we have already given away the first two ROCKSTAR NFTs to our awesome community members.\\n- We successfully launched the **EPNS Liquidity** **Rewards Program**, offering a total of 5,510,000 $PUSH to be distributed along the program and ending on 15th March 2023.\\n- We released the **EPNS Roadmap 2021,** that we are working on to achieve. Also, on that note we\u2019re **HIRING** for multiple roles at EPNS so if you are a curious developer (Reactjs, Nodejs, Solidity or Tech Lead) and like what we are doing, drop us a note at **support@epns.io** or send a DM to one of the admins here.\\n- Development on-going for Uniswap, Alpha Homora and a few secret channels \ud83d\ude09. Also, integrated .crypto and ENS support to EPNS mobile app\\n- Collaboration and Partnership with **Gitcoin** | **Polygon** | **Mask** **Network** | **PoolTogether** | **Alpha** **Homora** | **Biconomy** | **Frontier** | **bZx** | **Ceramic** **Network**\\n- Welcomed **Gitcoin Kernel** on our Advisory board\\n- Interviewed by BeInCrypto, CryptoKanoon, TheWolfDen Newsletter \u2014 Review of EPNS,TheDefiant \u2014 First look, Unstoppable domain podcast\\n- **Rockstars of Ethereum Y**outube series \u2014 Kevin Owocki, DeFi Dad episode\\n- Community-based AMA, Telegram and Youtube contest\\n\\nDone!\\n\\nJai: Absolutely, the support of community members is just WOW!\\n\\nRicha: Rockstar GIF.\\n\\nJai: YAY!! Community full of ROCKSTARS :D\\n\\nHarsh: GIF Jack Nicholson nodding.\\n\\nJai: Thank you for the answer @RJlwl let\u2019s move onto the next Question right away!\\n\\n**Question4\ufe0f\u20e3: What kind of token is $PUSH and what are the token utilities of it especially in EPNS dApp?**\\n\\nWho is going to take this up? :D\\n\\nJaf: I\u2019ll take this one too.\\n\\nJai: @JafCR is on fire.\ud83d\udd25\\n\\nJaf: $PUSH is a governance token that also carries usage mining incentives and the ability to split the fee pool in the future whenever the community chooses to enable that. It\u2019s designed to incentivize all actors in the ecosystem to participate and check each other! Keeping this short but a much better version of what all things it does and how it ties to the ecosystem can be found here: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-token-economics-d7f566c29b1a](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-token-economics-d7f566c29b1a)\\n\\nDone!\\n\\nJai: An informative article to go through for sure. \ud83d\udc40 Thank you for the answer.\\n\\nI am in love with NFT for sure, so next Question is around it.\\n\\nRicha: Sure.\\n\\n**Jai: Question5\ufe0f\u20e3: There\u2019s a huge market for NFTs in today\u2019s world. A lot of artists are coming up with their own NFTs. Does EPNS have any plans to integrate NFTs in any possible way?**\\n\\nRicha: NFTs are booming at the moment, and there is a significant opportunity for push notifications. As auctions take place on decentralized platforms, participants will want to know if they\u2019ve been outbid instead of having to check back in all the time to figure that out. We can set up a push notification for that. If you\u2019re an artist who has minted an NFT that has specific rules (royalty rules, use rules, perhaps generative/evolutionary rules), you can set up a push notification to know when those rules are met.\\n\\nWe\u2019re speaking with NFT-based marketplaces, dApp owners for future integrations of push notifications.\\n\\nDone!\\n\\nJai: Woah! Integrations would be really awesome.\\n\\n**Question6\ufe0f\u20e3: What are the major milestones EPNS have achieved so far and are there any competitors?**\\n\\n**Harsh:** Awesome question and probably I can take this!\\n\\n**Competitors:** We are the first one to do this so no direct competitors \ud83d\ude09. We have been lucky to have been at the right place at the right time. The only indirect competitors we can be compared with are Apple and Google if you go to Web 2.0 / closed ecosystem.\\n\\n**Journey:** We have had an awesome journey! Ideation and loads of research were taken to Ethereum Foundation -> EthGlobal HackMoney 2020 where we build POC -> selected for IDEO PVD -> selected for Gitcoin Kernel fellowship and came out as top 20 projects! -> entered Gitcoin Grant round 7 (top 5 projects / 210+ contributors) which led us to raise our seed ($1.4 Million).\\n\\nAlso, extremely grateful to be backed by 35+ top VCs and Web3 leaders including: Balaji Srinivasan, Binance Labs, True Ventures, LD Capital, Sandeep (Polygon), Mariano Conti, Anthony Sassano (EthHub / TheDailyGwei), DeFiDad, Preethi Kasireddy among several more awesome peeps.\\n\\nJai: Totally complete unique concept \ud83d\udc40\\n\\nHarsh: and\u2026 Done!\\n\\nJai: Impressive stuff! Thank you @harshr\\n\\n**Question7\ufe0f\u20e3: Can you share the steps with the community on how one can successfully receive PUSH Notifications?**\\n\\nJaf: GIF Bart Simpson. \u201cME! ME! ME!\u201d\\n\\nJai: Haha! I knew that \ud83e\udd2a\\n\\nJaf: In order to start receiving PUSH notifications, a user must first subscribe to at least one channel:\\n\\n\\\\- Make sure you have Metamask extension installed on your browser.\\n\\n\\\\- Connect your Metamask to the Ropsten Test Network.\\n\\n\\\\- Visit: [https://app.epns.io/.](https://app.epns.io/.)\\n\\n\\\\- After landing in the Channels section, go over the list of channels available to look for the one of your preference.

Please find an Ethereum Ropsten faucet conveniently located on the top of the channels section).\\n\\nNow, How to receive the notifications?\\n\\nThere are 2 options:\\n\\n1. From the top navigation menu, go to the \u201cFeedbox\u201d option.\\n\\nIn here users will be able to view all notifications sent to them from the different channels they are subscribed to.\\n\\n2. From the top navigation menu, go to the \u201cReceive Notifs\u201d option.\\n\\nFrom here users can install the Mobile App of their preference: Android or iOs.\\n\\nAfter installing the App, follow the step-by-step guide to start receiving notifications directly to your phone.\\n\\nDone!\\n\\nJai: Noted and all steps are now on our tips! :P\\n\\n**Thank you for the answers and this ends our first segment. Now we move to segment 2**\ufe0f\u20e3**.**\\n\\nFor Segment 2\ufe0f\u20e3, The team has selected 4 of the best Questions from Twitter.\\n\\nLet\u2019s go! \ud83d\udca5\\n\\n**First Question is from Elena Kasapidi (@EKasapidi) Congratulations!**\\n\\n**Can you tell us something about your vision and target that EPNS is focusing most until end of this year?**\\n\\nHarsh: Great question!\\n\\nWe recently released our roadmap with a ton of details. Make sure to check it out! [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12)\\n\\nThesis behind it\\n\\nTo start, we tried to find a balance that allows us to grow the protocol while providing the development community with the necessary tooling to integrate EPNS within their protocols and dApps.\\n\\nAdditionally, we put an important focus in extending the functionalities available in the Mobile App and the dApp. This aims to create a one-stop-shop for all users notification needs.\\n\\nLast but not least, a critical item in our roadmap is establishing an incentivized Peer-to-Peer network of PUSH Nodes \u2014 which will allow the community to play one more role in the EPNS ecosystem.s\\n\\nAll these efforts combined aims to find a balance between priortizing features important for users and for services to enable us to grow on both directions!\\n\\nDone!\\n\\nA lot of stuff is in pipeline I must say :D\\n\\n**Jai: Second Question is from ethereal.one (@ethereal_123) Congratulations**\\n\\n**What incentivizes services to offer EPNS on their platform? The incentives to the customer are clear: user-centricity, opportunity to earn and get notified, but why should a service integrate with EPNS?**\\n\\n**Richa:** In short: It\u2019s all UX and customer engagement / retention!\\n\\nTraditionally, Web2 services are ahead in this curve since they always notify the users when something important for them is happening! If you observe, almost all of your virtual interaction is through notifications whether it\u2019s emails, Venmo payments, Amazon deliveries, social media or even Whatsapp chats / videos. It all starts with services letting a user know that hey we think this might be important to you and then the user acts / ignores.\\n\\nComing to Web3, we all know that this communication layer is absent and causes several headaches, for example: loan liquidations happen, important governance proposals are missed, security audits aren\u2019t communicated in time, version rollouts are not conveyed, etc. The list essentially goes on. This causes discomfort and users disconnect which thankfully whoever we have spoken to in the services sectors have recognized which is why it\u2019s super essential for them to also get Web3 notifications going!\\n\\nDone!\\n\\nJai: \u201cIt\u2019s all UX and customer engagement/retention\u201d \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\\n\\nThank you @RJlwl for answering it\\n\\n**Next Question is from Lucky Mbu (@lucky_mbu)- Congratulations!**\\n\\n**What are benefit to user from governance of EPNS\u2019 system?**\\n\\nJaf: Let me jump into this one.\\n\\nThis is a great question that interests the community very much.\\n\\nThe main objective behind the EPNS governance strategy is starting a slow decentralization process that will ultimately give control to the community over important decisions of the protocol.\\n\\nSuch as upgradeability, incentives for active participation in the protocol, activating fees and fee split.\\n\\nDone!\\n\\nJai: Awesome @JafCR \u2708\ufe0f\\n\\n**Last Question in our Twitter round is from Carlos Mena (@asdasper)- Congratulations!**\\n\\n**I am interested in the Push Nodes P2P strategy. Can you give more details as to how you envision this working for community members that want to run a node?**\\n\\nHarsh: Sure\u2026 This strategy is aligned with our goal of becoming a defacto communication layer for Ethereum L1, L2s and then with other blockchain as well.\\n\\nWith this PUSH Nodes P2P network, we are introducing yet another role in the EPNS ecosystem, which will allow participants to spin their own nodes and assist in retrieving notifications and dispatching them to the corresponding carriers. Additionally, by providing this important service participants will receive incentives as rewards for being good actors. The incentives haven\u2019t been decided yet and we will provide more information on this as we move forward to this milestone.\\n\\nAnd done!\\n\\nJai: We are looking forward for more information on this @harshr \ud83d\udca5 thanks a lot for answering it.\\n\\nThank you for your answers team! We will now move to the last round which is **Live Q/A session.**\\n\\nDear Community, get ready to shoot all your Questions! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n**Segment** 3\ufe0f\u20e3: **HARSH/JAF/RICHA will answer the LIVE questions asked. Please note: The team can answer any number of Questions but at the end of the AMA, 4 BEST Questions will be rewarded.**\\n\\nI will leave the other questions for our community members to ask. Are you guys all set? \ud83d\udcaa\\n\\nHarsh: GIF Let\u2019s do this,\\n\\nJai: I will **UNMUTE** the group soon and team will pick and answer as many questions as possible but only participants with the BEST questions will be selected as winners by the end of AMA.\\n\\n3\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026\\n\\nLet\u2019s GO!!!! \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\\n\\nJai: Our chat is on MUTE again, we have got the last set of Questions from community members and I must say that the response is HUGE. I now request the team to pick and answer the BEST Questions. This AMA is getting really interesting.\\n\\nHarsh: Blown away!\\n\\n**Lee Chen: NFT is very hot trend now, do you pretend to catch up with this trend or still follow and focus your original roadmap? create values, not create TREND !**\\n\\nHarsh: Original Roadmap, $ROCKSTAR of EPNS is already created, we have 5\ufe0f\u20e30\ufe0f\u20e3 \ud83c\udfb8 NFTs to give away to the community, read more here: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf)\\n\\n**Thanh Trung: On the whitepaper it\u2019s been said notifications are treated more like a social feed. For Twitter being suspending the Twitter accounts of crypto and defi project, how can EPNS be alternative for crypto projects?**\\n\\nGreat to know you caught that! yes, building communication middleware means not only building notifications but anything that is used for communication is supported! EPNS can be an alternative to social media in the future with added features but currently our priority is to focus on notifs and push nodes.\\n\\n**Quynh Anh: What makes EPNS distinctive?**\\n\\nRicha: Sure! great question. Each project has a unique problem that they are trying to solve, be it DeFi, infrastructure or NFTs. First mover advantage, network effect along with the game theory to ensure win-win for all ecosystem players is important for a successful project. We believe EPNS encompasses all to have a unique advantage.\\n\\n**Quynh Anh: Staking is the new trend. What staking options are available for EPNS token? Are there any incentives for staking? What are the various ways to earn EPNS token and are there any limits to amount of EPNS I can earn?**\\n\\nHarsh: Checkout [https://incentives.epns.io](https://incentives.epns.io)\\n\\nJai: Such a HUGE opportunity for community members! \ud83c\udfc6\\n\\nRicha: Sure! Our Staking, and Time Vesting smart contracts, have been audited. Please refer to the audit report [https://epns.io/EPNS-release-Audit.pdf](https://epns.io/EPNS-release-Audit.pdf)\\n\\n**Xperia: Is EPSN system easy to use also for non-crypto savvy people? How user friendly is your interface?**\\n\\nHarsh: We are alpha but constantly working on improving the interface. We do think we will be able to attract non-crypto savvy people as we complete more features.\\n\\n**Viet Alexander Carlos Allentown: EPNS claims a collaboration with UNISWAP. We know that Uniswap will also launch its V3 version with many more functionalities, is EPNS ready to adapt to them?**\\n\\nRicha: We love the Uniswap team and are working with them to build the core features of EPNS protocol. Currently, the Uniswap Channel on EPNS protocol is under development for governance related notifications.\\n\\nYou can learn more our collab in this blog post [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/accelerating-defi-with-epns-f2cbfaa33c91](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/accelerating-defi-with-epns-f2cbfaa33c91)\\n\\n**Wolf Khikada: If many people who fully understand the EPNS project want to be part of the EPNS network and community, how can they be involved as a community? Do you have any ongoing rewards or incentives programs for now?**\\n\\nHarsh: Currently we are running Liquidity Program: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-liquidity-rewards-program-d16ff2c0fef4](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-liquidity-rewards-program-d16ff2c0fef4) and Rockstars Community Program: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf,](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf,) more will be coming soon! stay tuned!\\n\\n**LXM: Will there be an API available for users of the network to implement easily into various web services and sites? When do you think this will become available if so?**\\n\\nHarsh: Yes, our PUSH nodes will enable that along with our planned SDKs, more info about our roadmap here: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12)\\n\\n**Tamphat: So far, Almost 80% investors have just focused on price of token in short term instead of understanding the real value of the project. Can you tell us on motivations and benefits for investors to hold EPNS (EPNS) in long term? Will run any stake program with your token?**\\n\\nJaf: We are blessed and we are extremely proud of our backers, advisors and investors.\\n\\nThey have been instrumental to us in providing guidance and advisory because they care about this space, and they see the importance of filling this communication gap. They understand what it will bring to the advancement of usability, and that why they are invested in the project, because of the value it brings to everyone.\\n\\n**Mehdi AG: Are you planning to keep it only on eth network ?**\\n\\nRicha: Sure! So as our name suggests we are building on Ethereum blockchain and will go live in future first here. We are blockchain agnostic so in future multi blockchain is possible\\n\\n**KK \u2014 LIANG: EPNS is currently going well and is receiving positive attention. What will you do to get more exposure and adoption? What is the EPNS message for the Community today?**\\n\\nJaf: We are keeping in parallel different initiatives that will help with adoption\\n\\n\\\\- Developing tooling for the software development community\\n\\n\\\\- working on Collaboration Programs with key players in the space\\n\\n- Designing ways for the community to actively participate in the protocol.\\n\\n**SonGo Ku: Once the product is developed, one of the main challenges seems to be adoption. What are some of the plans to stimulate adoption and build out the ecosystem around EPNS?**\\n\\nJaf: We are forming strategic collaborations with key players. Not only because of how much we will learn and understand to develop the EPNS protocol further, but also because working with these other protocols will open a window for users to experience receiving notifications, and see how much value they provide.\\n\\n**Jessika: What was the biggest milestone your project has? What is plan in the future ?**\\n\\nRicha: Sure! Our 2021 roadmap is here [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12)\\n\\n**Santhosh Srinivasan: I\u2019m fascinated by the spam scores/verified badges aspect of EPNS. With how prevalent scams are in the industry currently, I think they could be really useful. You earlier spoke of a browser extension, could this be used to alert users about scammy websites (like the ones that ask you send X coins and get back 2X coins) or other bad actors?**\\n\\nJaf: Thanks! We also believe this is an important feature that will add a lot of value to users and services.\\n\\nAbout your question: yes! its doable.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve had a great experience working with developers creating their own channels because they have their own ideas that they want to make a reality.\\n\\n**CMD_GOD: What role does the community play in the EPNS financeio? What have you done and will do to attract people to join EPNS financeio and build a thriving community?**\\n\\nJaf: That\u2019s a great question, we constantly try to grow our community through initiatives and think the best way to strengthen the community is by asking them, do let us know if you have any ideas!\\n\\n**DeCh: From reading through the chat since launch, a lot of questions have been asked regarding auto-compounding of our stake rewards, and do you have plans to introduce a tracker similar to what @rzumbado has created, which is awesome.**\\n\\nRicha: Yes! Shoutout to @rzumbado for creating an awesome tracker. Of course, we will implement (copy \ud83d\ude05) some of the features. For auto staking, while we are still brain storming it seems a bit out of scope as it will require a new forumla and therefore audit and a lot of testing which is why it is not in any current sprint but we are not writing it off as well.\\n\\n**Thanh Trung: How does EPNS take care of user data? Is user data guaranteed to be safe from misuse of third parties? How does EPNS ensure that users\u2019** emails or smartphones are safe from spam or annoying ad offers?\\n\\nHarsh: We take care of the data by ensuring that we don\u2019t ask for it! EPNS follows web3 ethos very closely which means it doesn\u2019t send or ask for any identity except for your wallet address which we feel is how every interaction on web3 should be.\\n\\n**SonGo Ku: Vast majority of Crypto projects are built just for the sole purpose of amassing wealth for themselves. So, I want to know the EPNS you aim to add to crypto industry that will bring greater abundance to the industry?**\\n\\nHarsh: Vesting and backing should help improve the confidence! at the same time, it\u2019s essential to do your own research around the tech, how is it built and ask questions. We do feel we are building something that changes the ecosystem and have time and time again validated the idea by our awesome community but as mentioned, always, always asks questions\\n\\n**Mortimer \u2014 Morty\u2019\u2019s Nodes: What are you doing to attract investors from all over the world? What are you presenting projects to make investors part of your community?**\\n\\nHarsh: We already have 35+ top VCs and investors backing us up, you can see more info here: [https://epns.io](https://epns.io)\\n\\n**Dr. Stone: All crypto apps has inbuilt notification what any crypto op for this?**\\n\\nHarsh: Nice question, this is actually not the case. Some of the crypto apps have some notifications about limited operations you do on them which still work in centralized fashion, for example: facebook might send you notification about a post you like but who do they send it to? The answer is they send it to the communication middleware which if you are using Apple is going to be Apple Push Notification Service (APNs), we are building that communication layer for web3 so that all smart contracts, dApps (and not just a limited few) can finally have access to communication layer. This seems trivial but it essentially opens the gateway foor any platform to show these notifications as well as enable any web3 services to send anything. Another way to think is that we are building the SMTP protocol that will finally allow any user to send email to other users. Hope that clears it a bit \ud83d\ude05\\n\\nRicha: I think we over shot the AMA timeslot!\\n\\nThank you all for asking such awesome questions.

What does EPNS do?**\\n\\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is a platform-agnostic, decentralized notification protocol for Ethereum-based Web 3.0 applications. It enables users to receive notifications for on-chain or off-chain activity. EPNS allows Web3 actors (users, dapps, service providers) to create notifications that are triggered if and when a smart contract reaches certain conditions. Other Web3 participants can search, browse, and subscribe to specific notifications and more confidently interact with dapps. In doing so, EPNS combines the seamless user experience of Web 2.0 apps with the security and power of Web 3.0.\\n\\n## Q. What are some of the use cases for EPNS?\\n\\nWe believe almost any application in the Web3 ecosystem can benefit from notifications. Some of the highest-impact immediate opportunities are:\\n\\n**DEXes**: DEX users can be notified when the price of a token falls or rises a certain percentage. Users can also set up notifications for when their trades are executed and completed, rather than having to check back to see if trades were completed (especially during times of high network traffic). Users can also set up notifications for when gas prices go down or up to help them decide when to trade.\\n\\n**DeFi**: Lending protocol users can set up notifications to be informed when they are about to be liquidated, rather than needing to check in regularly to ensure. LP providers can also set up notifications about impermanent loss in case they wish to cut their losses short during a volatile market. If DeFi users are interacting with a particularly young or untested protocol, they could set up notifications to inform them if large amounts of funds are being moved around in ways that could signal instability within that dapp.\\n\\n**NFTs and Gaming:** Trading of NFTs or goods on markets or within games can be connected to EPNS to inform users 1) when certain goods go on sale or auction; 2) when auctions go live from crypto-artists; 3) when a bid is accepted or topped; 4) when one\u2019s own NFT (or anyone else\u2019s) sells.\\n\\n**ENS/Consumer Apps:** Apps like the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and .Crypto can notify users when their subscriptions are about to expire, rather than expecting users to remember or check in regularly to remind themselves of upcoming dates.\\n\\n## **Q. Why should I use EPNS?**\\n\\nBecause for so long, as a Web3.0 user, you waited on Twitter or Telegram for important updates and communications from your favorite dApps. Developers suffered while sending necessary information regarding their app or product over social media, hoping for their users to see it. Of course, without certainty. Consequently, users missed out on crucial notifications, alerts, notices, and offers. EPNS solves these, plus incentivizes both senders and receivers with usage rewards.\\n\\n## **Q. What are the EPNS Products?**\\n\\nThe EPNS product suite comprises the following elements:\\n\\n1.  **EPNS Protocol:** The main goal of the EPNS Protocol is to make sure all notifications are prepared and sent in compliance with the protocol standards. This will make every notification readily available to be picked up by the PUSH Nodes in charge of dispatching.\\n2.  **PUSH Nodes:** The main goal of the PUSH Nodes is to listen to events in the EPNS protocol smart contracts and dispatch the notifications to the corresponding recipients.\\n3.  **Governance**: Governance is crucial for any decentralized protocol, and EPNS is no exception. We already have introduced liquidity mining and staking along with ROCKSTAR of EPNS NFT and PUSH rewards.\\n4.  **Alpha dApp**: Using the dApp, Subscribers can receive notifications from web browsers, while Channels can send notifications to decentralized carriers.\\n5.  **Mobile App:** The mobile app serves the crucial purpose of sending notifications from decentralized protocols to centralized ecosystems, such as Android, iOS, and so on.\\n6.  **Showrunners**: These are channels through which the EPNS Foundation sends notifications for the benefit of the community. Sending notifications about domain expiry, liquidation, and abnormal gas prices are some of the intended purposes of these channels.\\n7.  **Development SDKs and Documentation**: For developers looking to easily integrate EPNS with partners, we\u2019ll be releasing the following SDKs \u2014 Front-end SDK, Back-end SDK, PUSH Mobile SDK, EPNS Subgraph.\\n\\nLearn more about the EPNS ecosystem and compliments in our [EPNS Roadmap 2021](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12).\\n\\n## Q. What are the main components of the EPNS Protocol?\\n\\nApart from the technological framework, the EPNS protocol consists of Users, who are further divided into Subscribers and Channels.\\n\\n1.  **Service**: Any dApp / smart contract / service / etc. that wishes to send notifications.\\n2.  **Channel**: A service who is sending notifications using EPNS. To ensure their skin-in-the-game, Channels need to stake predetermined fees in pools, which are in turn used for incentivizing usage. Developers and Web3 project owners can create channels using the EPNS dApp, JS Library, or custom libraries.\\n3.  **Subscriber:** A user who subscribes to channels on EPNS for receiving notifications. EPNS adopts the opt-in model for subscriptions, meaning that channels can send notifications only to voluntary participants. Subscriptions can either be direct or indirect, and you can unsubscribe at any time.\\n4.  **Users**: Any user who is present in the protocol registry.\\n\\n## **Q. What are the types of Channels on EPNS?**\\n\\nChannels on EPNS can be of 3 types (in future can be more)\u2014 Open, Closed, and Mutual. An Open Channel is open to all and anyone can join. In Closed Channels, subscribers can join only on invitation by the channel. Combining these two, a Mutual Channel is such that Subscribers can send requests which the channel has to accept. Apart from these three, there are two special, automated, and opt-in channels \u2014 EPNS Channel and EPNS Alerter Channel. These send notifications to Subscribers and Channels respectively.\\n\\n## Q. **How does the EPNS communication layer actually works ?**\\n\\nThe communication layer basically can be categorized in two segments:\\n\\n1\\\\. **Sending Notifs**: This layer comprises of smart contracts (and later p2p nodes) that acts like a middleware through which all notifs / communication from a service to their subscribers needs to flow. Having these on L1 and L2 ensures even smart contracts can send notifs out.\\n\\n2. **Receiving and dispersing Notifs:** This layer listens to our middleware smart contracts and then dispatches them forward.\\n\\nThese two segments ensures that communication is standardized, authenticated and can be listened to by any crypto wallet, mobile apps or any other infra service. Detailed read of the protocol can be found here: [https://whitepaper.epns.io](https://whitepaper.epns.io)\\n\\n## **Q. How do Channels send notifications?**\\n\\nEPNS is designed in a way such that Channels send notifications in the form of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) payloads. This allows for the flexible and streamlined transfer of the notification\u2019s data from a decentralized storage environment. Further, the information is transmitted and recorded on-chain, following due validation. Leveraging EPNS Infra, decentralized protocols can also send notifications to centralized environments. To send notifications, Channels have to bear a fee, payable in ETH or DAI. Apart from directly sending notifications to Subscribers, Channels can also delegate declared wallet addresses to transmit notifications on their behalf. For further details and mathematical expositions, read the [relevant sections from our White Paper](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/specifications).\\n\\n## **Q. How can I activate or deactivate a Channel?**\\n\\nTo activate a Channel, you need to stake 50 DAI or higher, which adds to the staking pool used for distributing token incentives. You can also deactivate the channel by unstaking, but this involves a penalty of 20 DAI \u2014 half of it remains in the Stake Pool and the rest goes to the Fee Pool. This mechanism minimizes the risks of bad actors getting onboard.\\n\\n## **Q. Can I get spammed on EPNS?**\\n\\nIn order to avoid spam, a spam score has been set from 0\u20131. 0 means that the channel has an excellent score while 1 means the channel is unhealthy. The range adjusts based on positive actions such as a higher number of subscribers, with the passing of time while negative actions are higher than usual unsubscribers, higher than usual notifications, etc. This is guided by the protocol and at a certain range, the protocol will start throttling the notifications or even stop them until the score comes back to a healthier range.\\n\\n## **Q. What are $PUSH tokens and how can I use them?**\\n\\n$PUSH is a governance token that also carries usage mining incentives and the ability to split the fee pool in the future whenever the community chooses to enable that, it\u2019s designed to incentivize all actors in the ecosystem to participate and check each other! Keeping this short but a much better version of what all things it does and how it ties to the ecosystem can be found here: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-token-economics-d7f566c29b1a](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-token-economics-d7f566c29b1a)\\n\\n## Q. What incentive mechanism are currently available?\\n\\nIncentives for participation both in terms of token rewards and otherwise is importance to ensure strong network effects. We already created the following incentives for governance:\\n\\n- Introduced liquidity mining and staking on [https://incentives.epns.io](https://incentives.epns.io/)\\n- Introduced $ROCKSTAR of EPNS NFTs and $PUSH rewards to signal gratitude to early community and to reward new community and their participation in the ecosystem.

The team has been working hard to deliver the new era of decentralized notifications in Web3, and we\u2019ve been receiving a ton of support from the community. But no matter how much we believe in the decentralized future of push notifications, we also realize that it doesn\u2019t matter until other teams, and projects, actually implement the protocol to bring notifications to their users.\\n\\nIn order to tackle this, EPNS has been partnering and collaborating with some of the most amazing and innovative teams within the Web3 space, introducing practical use cases fine-tuned and customized to each protocol\u2019s needs and niche. This not only allows us to show the world the true potential of decentralized push notifications with EPNS, but also create a more user-friendly experience for the users of our partner protocols.\\n\\nFor the past month or so, we have been consistently announcing new collaborations and partnerships, and we realize it might get a bit overwhelming to keep track of what projects are working with EPNS to make it better each day, and vice versa!

Oftentimes, DeFi protocols tend to act as gatekeepers to _which_ projects are allowed to be a part of their lending and borrowing pools; thereby barring a majority of DeFi projects from participation in the DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nUniLend is a permission-less decentralized protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and borrowing services through smart contracts. Even with the openness and permissionless features, one of the major gatekeepers of major adoption and user experience has always been the communication gap in the DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nTo help UniLend overcome this barrier and to truly unlock the potential of digital assets for their users, we are glad to announce our pilot program with UniLend Finance to provide decentralized push notifications to their users.\\n\\n## **Why is there a need for notifications in UniLend? \u2014 The Problem**\\n\\nUnlike other DeFi protocols out there, UniLend allows you to list ERC20s in a permissionless way on their platform, and also allows you to trade (spot trading), lend and borrow with interest and even perform Flash Loans on any ERC20 asset with liquidity, easily on their interface. This opens up a whole new door for projects that are not listed on other lending platforms who only provide permissioned access to list their projects as pools.\\n\\nBy leveraging these features, UniLend acts as an infrastructure that solves the problems of fragmentation and limited functionality in the current DeFi lending ecosystem by supporting and offering comprehensive functionality for a vast range of digital assets. However the lack of communication in the current state of DeFi protocols means that users of UniLend face trouble when they are not able to know when:\\n\\n- Their favorite cryptos are listed on UniLend\\n- When their loans are about to get liquidated\\n- When their trade (spot trade) has gone through\\n- If their flash loan was successfully executed\\n- When new governance proposals are listed\\n- When new airdrops are announced\\n\\n> \u201cUniLend is excited to integrate EPNS\u2019s decentralized push notification service into our tech stack. This will create a more transparent overall user experience and give users engaging with our platform a more user-focused feel.\u201d _Chandresh Aharwar, UniLend Co-founder & CEO_\\n\\nWithout the provision of instant real-time notifications for spot trades, and lending & borrowing; users may not be able to stay up to date on their loans, trades, and positions on UniLend. If they want to, users would need to keep a track of their positions by continuously logging back in to the dApp, to make sure their loans are not liquidated, or they need to scour social media to check if there are any new airdrops or giveaways happening on UniLend.\\n\\n## **Instant EPNS Magic! \u2014 The Solution**\\n\\nThe state of service-client relationship and communication is strictly restricted by Web2 infrastructure such as Telegram, Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Medium, etc. This not only results in fragmentation of sources of information but also results in a void in user personalization.In this age of Web3 technology, it is still a burning issue in how to create trustworth and efficient communication medium for services and users without invading their Web3 privacy.\\n\\n> \u201cThis partnership allows us at EPNS to not only support Unilend\u2019s journey to true decentralization, but also provide them with a decentralized communication infrastructure to further their decentralization agenda\u201d commented Harsh Rajat, founder EPNS.\\n\\nBy integrating with EPNS, the communication between services and users are greatly improved which also allows for a much more personalized user experience and completely uses Web3 decentralized infrastructure along with decentralized identity integrations in the near future \u2014 users can now receive alerts and notifications on events that concern them, their trade and loan positions, and also get to learn about major events, airdrops, governance proposals, and other announcements right at their fingertips without having to wander through the project\u2019s social media all the time.\\n\\n## **The Crossover \u2014 What we will achieve**\\n\\nEPNS will work with the UniLend team to set up channel _(see our_ [_litepaper_](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-whitepaper/blob/master/Ethereum%20Push%20Notification%20Service%20Litepaper.pdf) _for definitions of channels, services, and more)_ to allow users to receive notifications directly on user wallets without any hassle, these channels will allow for use cases that encourage users to be more in control of information, and hence be more confident to make more educated decisions on their trades and stay on top of their DeFi game always.\\n\\nUniLend users through EPNS will be able to:\\n\\n- Learn when new tokens are listed on the dApp\\n- Learn the status of their swap or spot trade\\n- Learn when new governance proposals or airdrops are announced\\n- Get notified when their Flash Loan goes through.\\n- Customize notifications according to their preferences and priorities\\n\\n## **$PUSH Liquidity + Flash Loans!**\\n\\nUniLend is one of the first and only protocols that provides Flash Loan functionality to chains in addition to Ethereum. Flash Loans are more gas-efficient and cost lesser fees on the protocol, when compared to their competitors. Due to its nature of permissionless listing and Flash Loan fees as less as **_0.05%_**, adding $PUSH liquidity to UniLend\u2019s protocol allows $PUSH to be Flash Loaned and allows traders to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, which also opens up many other trading strategies for $PUSH.\\n\\nThis creates a new revenue generating use case for $PUSH tokens & allows token holders to earn staking rewards & airdrops \ud83e\ude82\\n\\nStakers on UniLend also get a share of the Flash Loans fee that are collected, as **70% of the Flash Loans Fee goes to the Staking Pool.** With UniLend\u2019s easy UX, the rewards are given instantly to the stakers and added to the liquidity pool and restaked.\\n\\nBy working with UniLend we are able to expand UniLend\u2019s vision of following the Web3 ethos of decentralization. By allowing permissionless listing of tokens on their platform, UniLend allows any project to be able to leverage interest based lending and borrowing with collateralization which is usually restricted to only certain projects by most other platforms. By taking this approach, UniLend wants to embrace the Web3 ethos of decentralization and allow anyone to be a part of the larger DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nWe are absolutely thrilled and honored to work with UniLend, and look forward to their users receiving decentralized push notifications that improve their overall user and trading experience.\\n\\n## **About UniLend Finance**\\n\\nUniLend is a permission-less decentralized DeFi protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and borrowing services through smart contracts.\\n\\nStay in touch with UniLend Finance!

To bridge the communication gap, we are excited to announce the launch of a pilot program to provide decentralized push notifications to the users of bZx \u2014 the most powerful open finance protocol in the DeFi market for developing decentralized margin lending applications.\\n\\n## **Why bZx Users Need Decentralized Notifications**\\n\\nBoth lenders and borrowers benefit from margin trading \u2014 the use of borrowed funds to leverage trade positions \u2014 on the decentralized bZx platform. Features such as holding assets off-exchange, reduced hacking risk, multi-protocol trading features, and lower fees allow lenders to lend at more attractive interest rates and traders to increase their purchasing power through loans. Owing to these advantages, the bZx platform currently supports a [daily trading volume of $36 million](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bzx-protocol/). Yet without a decentralized push notification service, traders lose opportunities to both increase rewards and lower risks when trading on margin.\\n\\n> _\u201cEnabling instant notifications on our DeFi margin trading, borrowing, and lending products will lead to significant improvements for end users by providing updates on open positions at risk of liquidation.\u201d \u2014 commented bZx Team_\\n\\nOn bZx, lenders can instantly issue non-custodial margin loans straight from their wallets to the borrower\u2019s wallet secured by smart contracts. However, important trade notifications \u2014 such as alerts on price, margin rates, margin calls \u2014 to manage the higher risks of using leverage are often delayed. Lacking a decentralized notification service, notices are often sent via Telegram, Twitter or through other non-direct mediums. While trade orders are broadcast through text, email, and morse code.\\n\\n## **The EPNS Solution**\\n\\nAlternatively, bZx users could use a decentralized push notification service and receive timely notifications through a single source of communication. Instead of relying on tweets, Telegram messages, and emails, traders gain an edge through instant notifications to their wallets. EPNS is the first native, on-chain notification solution to stream all crucial time-sensitive information to a user\u2019s wallet. The partnership benefits to bZx users include:\\n\\n- EPNS will send all margin lending and trading notifications directly to bZx user wallets.\\n- The EPNS and bZx teams will adapt the highly customizable EPNS protocol to meet the myriad of push notification needs of the users of both traditional and multi-protocol lending products.\\n- EPNS channels and users can customize their notification settings for different DeFi products.\\n\\n## **EPNS Collaboration With bZx: What We Plan to Achieve**\\n\\nDuring our \u201cpilot program\u201d collaboration with bZx, we will build a channel for bZx (see our [litepaper](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ethereum-push-notification-service-litepaper-e7ca0a662862) for definitions of channels, services, and more). Anyone can subscribe to the bZx channel and begin receiving notifications to their wallets immediately. The notifications are customizable and can include transaction notices, margin alerts, margin calls and any other DeFi notifications. By building this channel in collaboration with the bZx team, we will have the opportunity to better understand precisely what margin trading dApps want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\n> \u201cThe pilot program for margin trading, which amplifies both potential profits and losses, will provide a live demonstration of how trading notifications pushed to wallet addresses, can reduce trading risks. Being in control of information increases user confidence, and confident users outperform the rest,\u201d commented Harsh Rajat, founder EPNS.\\n\\nLooking forward, we foresee many new EPNS notification channels being introduced to meet the needs of more advanced cross-chain lending services. bZx is at the forefront of multi-protocol and composable lending products. Novel lending products such as bZX\u2019s margin loan tokenization, whereby iTokens (interest) and pTokens (short and leveraged positions) can be composed into novel financial products, are accelerating the need for push notifications.\\n\\nThe long-term goal of the pilot program is to develop a notification system for future versions of bZx. Users \u2014 who can easily integrate the bZx protocol into an exchange, wallet or [Web3 app](https://cryptopurview.com/internet-evolution-with-web-3-0-and-blockchain-role-in-it/) \u2014 will expect push notifications to be an integral service. Furthermore, innovative notification solutions pioneered by one dApp are likely to be swiftly adopted by others, especially in the highly collaborative, interoperable DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nWe are honored to be partnering with the bZx margin trading platform and anticipate EPNS push notifications becoming an in-demand service of the margin trading dApps building on bZx.\\n\\n## **About bZx**\\n\\nbZx is a financial protocol for lending and borrowing through a tokenized margin trading and lending system built on Ethereum. iTokens and pTokens can be composed into novel financial products, used as collateral for loans, or listed on any exchange to instantly enable margin lending and trading. bZx Protocol allows anyone to build applications that empower lenders, borrowers, and traders with the most flexible decentralized finance protocol on Ethereum.\\n\\nStay in touch with bZx!

We have received so much support and appreciation from the entire Ethereum community, and we can\u2019t thank you enough.\\n\\nThis week marks the one year anniversary of the start of EPNS\u2019 journey towards becoming the standard, flexible communication middleware for both Web3 and Web2 companies to benefit from.\\n\\nFor the EPNS protocol to become a de-facto communication layer, several different ecosystem cogs need to be innovated and developed. Our roadmap for 2021 thus is designed to address the highest priority elements that we intend to complete to achieve the maximum impact with v1.0 of the EPNS Protocol and the entire ecosystem of EPNS.\\n\\nWorking on these will enable us to deploy the protocol on the Ethereum Mainnet with the necessary communication middleware APIs and SDKs built into it for sending notifications, which will allow us to foster a developer ecosystem.\\n\\nAdditionally, putting special attention to creating a receiving infrastructure that allows for the easier embracing of the protocol for any crypto wallets and platform that wants to implement decentralized notifications.\\n\\nTo help us achieve our objectives, we will focus on the following product categories:\\n\\n- EPNS Protocol (Send Notifications)\\n- PUSH Nodes (Retrieval & Dispatch)\\n- Governance of EPNS Protocol\\n- Front-End products: dApp, MobileApp, Browser extension\\n- Development SDKs and Documentation\\n- Showrunners (to enable traditional services to interface with Web3)\\n\\n#### EPNS Protocol (Send Notifications)\\n\\n![First Image of EPNS Roadmap 2021](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nThe main goal of the EPNS Protocol is to make sure all notifications are prepared and sent in compliance with the protocol standards. This will make every notification readily available to be picked up by the PUSH Nodes in charge of dispatching.\\n\\nTo this effect, we already have completed several features, some of the prominent ones are:\\n\\n- Upgradability with on-chain governance upgrades\\n- Ability to create channels\\n- Ability to subscribe / unsubscribe\\n- Ability to passively earn through staking (by services)\u2014 lending (via protocol) \u2014 interest (to users)\\n- Ability to send notifs\\n\\nThough the majority of the MVP features are complete, we did find a few more features during our validation cycle to include those in v1 as well. Some of these are:\\n\\n- Delegating multiple user wallets to send notifications on a channel\u2019s behalf\\n- Enabling subscription via meta transactions\\n- Verification badges and social proofs that can be used as a reputation score and to filter channels on the frontend\\n- Pivoting to delivering all notifs even when a user is not a subscriber of a channel. Instead, having provisions to land them into spam box achieving the same - result but a more adaptable UX\\n- Designing the spam score throttle to ensure automatic throttling of notifs\\n- Layer 2 support for the protocol\\n- Integrating Ceramic decentralized identifier (DID)\\n\\nBy delegating more wallets, we intend to address the issue of network congestion. If a channel delegates 5\u20136 wallets, then these could be used to send notifications in a round-robin fashion and hence reduce the chance of transactions being queued in the txpool.\\n\\nAt present, using the EPNS protocol, a service can send messages and notify only its subscribers. We plan to upgrade it in such a way that services may send messages to all its users, but only those who have subscribed to the channel would receive the message as a notification. Others would receive it in their spam box without a push notification.\\n\\nWith the integration of Ceramic, users would be able to receive notifications on their DID, which could be an ID connected to an ethereum wallet or bitcoin of any other blockchain.\\n\\n#### Push Nodes (Retrieve and Dispatch)\\n\\n![Second Image of EPNS Roadmap 2021](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nThe main goal of the PUSH Nodes is to listen to events in the EPNS protocol smart contracts and dispatch the notifications to the corresponding recipients.\\n\\nFeatures currently available include:\\n\\n- The cache of channels/payloads\\n- Capability to map subscribers addresses to channels in the database\\n- Ability to deconstruct and synchronize payloads sent from a channel in the payloads database\\n- Connect wallet addresses to deviceIDs\\n\\nWhile currently the receiving nodes infrastructure is built in a centralized manner, working on decentralizing this component is one of our top priorities.\\n\\nSome of the tasks we will be working on are:\\n\\n- Establish a peer-to-peer network of PUSH nodes\\n- Implement a P2P Push nodes incentive mechanism\\n- Pinning of notification payloads on IPFS\\n\\nEven though we only listen to smart contracts of Layer 1 dApps and services at the moment, our ultimate aim is to be a blockchain agnostic decentralized middleware solution. Forming a P2P network of PUSH Nodes would be a stepping stone to achieving that goal. This will ensure nodes are more scalable and the protocol will be able to support Layer 2 solutions and lays the foundation to support other solutions as well in the future. Along with establishing the network, the implementation of an incentive mechanism for active participants is also in our pipeline.\\n\\nWith all notification payloads uploaded to IPFS, making sure that no notification gets lost is of utmost importance. We will be working towards pinning all the notification payloads sent out to users.\\n\\n#### Governance\\n\\n![Third Image of EPNS Roadmap 2021](./image-3.webp)\\n\\nGovernance is crucial for any decentralized protocol, and EPNS is no exception. Incentives for participation both in terms of token rewards and otherwise is importance to ensure strong network effects. We already created the following incentives for governance:\\n\\nIntroduced liquidity mining and staking on https://incentives.epns.io\\nIntroduced $ROCKSTAR of EPNS NFTs and $PUSH rewards to signal gratitude to early community and to reward new community and their participation in the ecosystem. [Read more about it here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/the-first-nft-collection-from-epns-677e23173c95)\\n\\nMoving forward, we plan to further introduce three governance capabilities to continue decentralizing the EPNS protocol:\\n\\n- Upgradeability through online voting\\n- Incentives towards developing 3rd party channels via the protocol\\n  -Incentives for active participation in the protocol\\n\\nThe $PUSH Token plays an essential role as it carries on-chain governance as well as enabling fees to split right from the token genesis. Token holders that own the tokens for the longest time will have higher fees based on their share \u2014 whenever a majority of users decides to activate the fee and the fee split.\\n\\n#### Development SDKs, and Documentation\\n\\n![Fourth Image of EPNS Roadmap 2021](./image-4.webp)\\n\\n<b>Toolkits and SDKs</b>\\nAfter participating in Hackathons, bounty programs, and integrating EPNS with some of our partners, we\u2019ve learned which tools will make a developer\u2019s life easier.\\n\\nWe are targeting the release of four SDKs:\\n\\n<b>Front-end SDK</b>: Will enable 3rd party services to interface with the channels, and facilitate sending notifications to users directly from third party dApp front-ends.\\n\\n<b>Back-end SDK</b>: Will allow easy integration for protocols wanting to send notifications interfacing directly with the EPNS protocol smart contracts.\\n\\n<b>PUSH Mobile SDK</b>: Will enable Mobile Apps to easily integrate and interface with EPNS PUSH Nodes and receive real-time notifications with the PUSH SDK doing most of the heavy lifting.\\n\\n<b>EPNS Subgraph</b>: Together with these three important components of our Developers Toolkit, we will continue developing further our Subgraph.\\n\\n#### Technical Documentation\\n\\nWe will develop extensive Technical documentation about the EPNS products, Integration guides, and tutorials in addition to what already exists. From the basic HelloWorld to more complex integrations with real-world protocols.\\n\\nOur focus will be on three main areas, for which we will provide both simple and advanced examples of all types of integration:\\n\\n<i>\\nServer Integration \u2192 through EPNS protocol\\n\\ndApp Integration \u2192 through EPNS protocol\\n\\nSmart Contract Integrations \u2192 through EPNS protocol Smart Contracts\\n</i>\\n\\nWith the Server integration, our intent is to provide developers with a boilerplate solution that will help them speed up the EPNS integration process into their respective protocols.\\n\\nSome additional guides for developers we will be working on are:\\n\\n- How to Create channels?\\n- How to Send notifications through the dApp?\\n- How to deliver automated notifications?\\n\\n#### How To Guides for End users\\n\\nOur How-To Guides section will be mostly focused on end-users. Providing them with a One-stop-shop to help them get set up and maximize the power of EPNS and all its products.\\n\\n- How to set up to receive decentralized notifications?\\n- How to subscribe to channels?\\n\\n### Front-End\\n\\n![Fifth Image of EPNS Roadmap 2021](./image-5.webp)\\n\\nEPNS will offer three major front-end components providing participants of the protocol different alternatives to interface with their favorite products and services. These components are:\\n\\n- dApp (decentralized App)\\n- MobileApp (iOS & Android)\\n- Browser extension.\\n\\n#### Decentralized App (dApp)\\n\\nUp until today, we have been working on a set of foundational features on our dApp that will allow us to grow more functionalities. Some of them being:\\n\\n- Creation of channels and viewing basic channel statistics (Stake of channel, number of users, Owner indicator)\\n- Subscribe/Unsubscribe to channels and viewing notifications.\\n- Sending different types of notifications with different configurations.\\n\\nNow, we will add more mechanisms for channel owners and subscribers to do more! Some of them being:\\n\\n<b>For channel owners:</b>\\n\\n- Adding Notification templates, notification previews, a quick send panel, and scheduling of notifications\\n- Seeing notification statistics\\n- Updating/disabling channels, readjusting stakes, channel categories, verified badges for channels\\n\\n<b>\\nFor Subscribers:\\n</b>\\n\\n- Mass channel subscribe/unsubscribe\\n- Different channel layouts, and the ability to configure settings per channel when available.\\n- Channels filters and categories\\n- Display of approximate earnings\\n\\nAdditionally, for the end-user, we will develop dashboards that will give much more aside from receiving notifications or browsing channels. It will allow the user to perform actions regarding governance, rewards incentives, creating profiles, and more.\\n\\n#### Mobile App (iOS & Android)\\n\\nSame as with the dApp, we have been building a solid foundation and now its time to scale it. Some of the features we have been working on being:\\n\\n- Signing in with just the public wallet address\\n- A dashboard that allows users to view their profile and lock the app, as well as swiping out a wallet\\n- Receiving notifications based on Pull, including private notifications\\n- Support for logging in with ENS and .crypto domains\\n- Streamline the mobile app onboarding process by allowing users to configure access to the app using passcode and biometrics\\n\\nNow, these are some of the features we have in the pipeline to expand the set of functionalities available in the Mobile App:\\n\\n- Channels discovery, Muting of notifications, Report Spam, Scanning QR codes to subscribe to channels.\\n- Notifications search, pagination, different notifications screen layouts, improved security towards displaying private notifications \u2014 including adding other methods such as Wallet Connect to read private notifications without signing via private key\\n- Profile information including passive earnings, and the ability to claim passive earnings from the Dashboard.\\n\\n#### Browser Extension\\n\\nThis component seeks to be a very lightweight yet powerful tool that provides a reduced but still rich feature set of all the capabilities available in the dApp and the Mobile App.\\n\\n#### Showrunners (Notification Logic Nodes)\\n\\n![Sixth Image of EPNS Roadmap 2021](./image-6.webp)\\n\\nAn important part of our plan falls into improving our Showrunners offering by expanding its capabilities together with adding more useful channels to the community.\\n\\nWe have already achieved significant progress in the infrastructure front, by implementing the following:\\n\\n- Routines to ensure business continuity, making provisioning a priority by implementing channel monitoring with alerting and automatic funds flow from Master - Wallets to Supporting Wallets\\n- Channels testing tools for developers\\n- Notifications scheduling capabilities blockchain-based and event-based\\n- Database Support, Cache layer, and Logging\\n\\nHaving worked on these foundational elements empowers us to have more flexibility to design channels that meet the community needs, and also prepare us to be ready for upcoming trends and new protocols.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s next in line?\\n\\n- Ability to send email from AWS SES\\n- Ability to send notifications from multiple wallets for the same channel\\n- Robust list of channels that provide significant value to the community covering a wide variety of topics such as DeFi, DAOs, Services, NFTs, and marketplaces.\\n\\nWe plan to release v1.0 of our Showrunners this year to serve as a boilerplate solution for developers to rapidly develop their own Showrunners software.\\n\\nTLDR;\\n\\n![Seventh Image of EPNS Roadmap 2021](./image-7.webp)\\n\\nWe are proud and committed to our mission to fill an existing gap in communication in Web3 today and we take this endeavor with the greatest urgency and responsibility. Let\u2019s build the ultimate notifications layer suite together!\\n\\nIf you have any comments or questions please feel free to reach out to us on telegram or check out our website for more details: https://epns.io/"},{"id":"scaling-web3notifs-on-polygon","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/scaling-web3notifs-on-polygon","source":"@site/blog/2021-04-27-scaling-web3notifs-on-polygon/index.md","title":"Scaling Web3Notifs on Polygon\u2019s Layer-2","description":"Scaling Web3Notifs on Polygon\u2019s Layer-2","date":"2021-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 27, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Announcements","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/announcements"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Polygon Network","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/polygon-network"},{"label":"Partnerships","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/partnerships"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"}],"readingTime":1.5533333333333332,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"scaling-web3notifs-on-polygon","title":"Scaling Web3Notifs on Polygon\u2019s Layer-2","description":"Scaling Web3Notifs on Polygon\u2019s Layer-2","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Without a doubt the driving force behind the success of the Ethereum blockchain is and will be the community behind it.","tags":["Announcements","Notifications","Polygon Network","Partnerships","Ethereum"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EPNS Roadmap 2021","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-roadmap-2021"},"nextItem":{"title":"EPNS Monthly Blocks","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-monthly-blocks-march-2021"}},"content":"import { ImageText } from \'@site/src/css/SharedStyling\';\\n\\n![Cover Image of Scaling Web3Notifs on Polygon\u2019s Layer-2](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nToday, we are excited to announce our partnership with Polygon (previously Matic) to scale EPNS\u2019 solution for Ethereum and compatible blockchains, bringing the vision of decentralized notifications even further into the Web3 ecosystem.\\n\\nOur relationship with Polygon started in September of 2020 when [EPNS secured a partnership with then-Matic along with a grant](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-secures-partnership-with-matic-along-with-a-sweet-grant-b956a85c3151). We have always believed in Polygon\u2019s mission and vision, and seeing it come to reality is a tremendous step forward for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Multi-chain scalability is the future of the Web3 ecosystem, and we\u2019re excited to be partnering with a team with such a grand vision.\\n\\nWe are humbled to announce that our partnership with Matic has extended into our partnership with Polygon, and will allow us to work in collaboration with this amazing team to further develop the [EPNS](http://epns.io) protocol.\\n\\nDuring our \u201cpilot program\u201d collaboration with Polygon, we will build a channel for them with EPNS (see our [litepaper](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-whitepaper/blob/master/Ethereum%20Push%20Notification%20Service%20Litepaper.pdf) for definitions of channels, services, and more). Anyone can subscribe to the Polygon channel and begin receiving notifications to their wallets immediately. The notifications are customizable, and will include alerts such as when the funds have been moved from Polygon L2 to Ethereum L1 among other important events. By building this channel in collaboration with the Polygon team, we will also have the opportunity to better understand precisely what dapps want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nOur partnership with Polygon will consist of:\\n\\n- Implementation of Polygon\u2019s infrastructure in the EPNS protocol to deliver scalable, low-cost notifications.\\n- Creating a channel for Polygon and delivering notifications important for their network.\\n- Co-development of notification infrastructure to support Polygon\u2019s vision of the \u201cInternet of Blockchains.\u201d\\n- Development of notifications for the MATIC community and Polygon project. Co-development of push notifications for the Ethereum ecosystem.\\n\\nPolygon plays a critical role for the entire ecosystem, as it provides a platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development that will greatly increase the capabilities of the entire Ethereum network. It is a pleasure and an honor to have the opportunity to work with this amazing team in bringing decentralized notifications to new heights.\\n\\n## **About Polygon (Formerly Matic)**\\n\\nPolygon is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. Its core component is Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports building and connecting Secured Chains like Plasma, Optimistic Rollups, zkRollups, Validium etc and Standalone Chains like Matic POS, designed for flexibility and independence.

In the case of [KERNEL](https://kernel.community/) (a [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) collective) those numbers represent 500+ developers, researchers, entrepreneurs, artists, designers, investors and incredible humans interested in Web 3.0. It is with great pleasure that we announce KERNEL is joining the EPNS advisory board.\\n\\nWith a shared vision to build a better web, we look forward to strategic guidance from the KERNEL community as we build out a critical communication component of Ethereum and Web 3.0, decentralized communication, including:\\n\\n- Insight into developer issues and requirements for Web 3.0 services\\n- The pulse of the Web 3.0 industry and latest technological developments\\n- An understanding of cross-chain communication integration issues and value stream creation opportunities\\n\\nWeb 3.0 developers are at the forefront of building scalable and interoperable blockchains and protocols for next generation permissionless networks. Yet as cross-chain communication becomes standard, the users of the dApps, platforms, and smart contracts deploying on these blockchains still lack a decentralized communication medium.\\n\\nAs we develop the missing piece of Web 3.0 infrastructure \u2014 a blockchain agnostic decentralized middleware messaging solution for any dApp, smart contract, or Web 3.0 service \u2014 KERNEL provides an important communication channel with talented Web 3.0 entrepreneurs early in their journey. We hope to build EPNS alongside them!\\n\\nKERNEL brings together the Web 3.0 community through events that develop the thinking skills, innovative tools, and decentralized solutions to succeed at Web 3.0 projects. Their main program, a KERNEL Block, is an 8-week program bringing together 250 talented individuals in Web 3 for peer-to-peer sharing, learning and mentorship from industry leaders through talks and fireside chats. Over 600 KERNEL Alumni, 50+ KERNEL Companies, and support from Gitcoin help guide the community as it supports projects like EPNS.\\n\\nThrough KERNEL\u2019s dedication to nurturing deep bonds in the Web 3.0 community, EPNS will not only benefit from direct guidance and advice. By being part of a strong Web 3.0 community, we can foster deep relationships with peers in KERNEL where EPNS can learn, grow and continuously evolve our own products for the Web 3.0 community.\\n\\nTaking the advisor role, Gitcoin KERNEL (Vivek Singh) said:\\n\\n> EPNS (Harsh and Richa, specifically) are shining stars who we are grateful to have in KERNEL. They are a thoughtful leadership team suited to explore how internet communication protocols (starting with notifications) can be implemented in more harmonious and humane ways.\\n\\n## **ABOUT KERNEL**\\n\\nKERNEL is a Web 3 family. It breathes through the deep bonds created amongst 600 (and counting) builders in Web 3 who have joined an 8 week experience called a KERNEL Block. Building something new in Web 3? We\u2019d love for you to consider joining us for the next block, [KB3](http://kernel.community).\\n\\nKERNEL speakers and mentors include Vitalik Buterin, Dandelion Mane, Linda Xie, Juan Benet, Simona Pop, Andy Tudhope, Morgan Beller, Jesse Walden, and 100+ more.\\n\\nStay in touch with Gitcoin KERNEL!

One of the exploration points for that is meta transactions to offload the users on-chain interactions. EPNS is ecstatic to state that we will be exploring Biconomy to enable meta transactions for the same during the pilot as well. By working closely with the Biconomy team we will have an opportunity to understand clearly the needs of Web3 infrastructure leaders in this space.\\n\\nBy working on integration with Biconomy, EPNS is excited to showcase how collaborations are important for decentralized applications to take their business to the next level and provide a frictionless user experience and higher level of participation.\\n\\n## **About Ethereum Push Notification Service**\\n\\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is a decentralized notification protocol that enables any smart contracts, dApps or even traditional services to send notifications to wallet addresses, as long as those wallet addresses have opted in to receive them from that particular service.\\n\\nStay in touch!

It never stops growing, never stops innovation, and certainly it never stops surprising everyone in the crypto-space and in the traditional finance world. Keeping up with this rapidly changing environment requires developing tools and products that can interoperate, and equally as important \u2014 developing great user friendly interfaces. This is where EPNS plugs-in to help meet the most demanding user expectations.\\n\\nTowards this effort, we\u2019re excited to announce that we are working with the [Alpha Finance Lab](https://alphafinance.io/) team to further develop the core EPNS protocol features through their Alpha Homora product. Alpha Homora brings protocol interoperability to a whole new level, and allows users to participate as Yield farmers, Liquidity providers, ETH lenders, liquidators, and bounty hunters. For EPNS this represents a great opportunity to join forces with one of the most cutting-edge teams in the DeFi scene to make sure we grow our protocol to create sustainable, decentralized notifications.\\n\\nOur pilot program with [Alpha Finance Lab](https://twitter.com/AlphaFinanceLab) and their Alpha Homora product will consist of:\\n\\n- Building a channel for Alpha Homora on our protocol (see our [litepaper](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-whitepaper/blob/master/Ethereum%20Push%20Notification%20Service%20Litepaper.pdf) for definitions of channels, services, and more).\\n- Exploring and creating notifications use cases like upcoming liquidation of leveraged positions etc.\\n- Working with Alpha Homora team to enable technical discussions towards building a decentralized communication layer that is scalable and powerful for the whole of Web3.0.\\n\\nWe are eager to begin this journey with the amazing Alpha Finance Lab team to continue growing DeFi to new heights.\\n\\n**_Pilot Program Updates_** **_as of June 24th, 2021_**\\n\\nWith Alpha Homora we created a channel to which users can opt-in to receive notifications about their loan positions when they reach a risky level.\\n\\n![First Image of We \ud83d\udc96 Alpha Homora, innovations in DeFi with EPNS](./image-1.gif)\\n\\nCurrently, the threshold is defined programmatically as this implementation relies on our Showrunners framework.\\n\\nWorking on this case gave us food for thought, and developed into internal brainstorming sessions to understand how to address some settings like this via the protocol.\\n\\n## **About Alpha Finance Lab**\\n\\nAlpha Finance Lab is an ecosystem of DeFi products that will interoperate to maximize returns while minimizing downside risks for users. Each Alpha product focuses on capturing unaddressed demand in DeFi in an innovative and user friendly way.\\n\\nStay in touch with Alpha Finance !

Every Monday, we\u2019ll give one EPNS NFT to a community member who has been a particular fan, supporter, and evangelist of the EPNS protocol. 1 per week until we celebrate our one year anniversary at this same time next year.

It has become a powerful tool for communication and coordination not just in Web2, but in Web3 as well. Recently on Twitter, people developed and created PleasrDAO in 2 days with 310 ETH for the sole purpose of buying an NFT.\\n\\nIt is no secret that our Web3 world heavily relies on social media to pass relevant information. The Mask Network is leveraging social media to onboard more people to the crypto ecosystem, including being able to purchase and swap cryptocurrencies without ever having to leave Twitter or Facebook.\\n\\nIn addition to supporting DeFi, the Mask Network team strongly believes in democratizing the internet. With individual data privacy a major concern for social media users, Mask Network offers encrypted messages which only the intended user can decrypt. On this journey of Mask Network to redefine the future of the internet, we are super excited to collaborate with them to run our pilot program.\\n\\nIn February 2021, the Mask Network had released their native governance token, $MASK. While the tool they are building on top of Web2 gives individuals the benefits of Web3, it is a cumbersome process for the team to reach out to their targeted users through the same media. This is where EPNS fits in. As a protocol, we are trying to bridge the gap between users and services by adding a communication layer.\\n\\nOur focus during this pilot program will be on creating a channel for Mask Network that will allow the team to communicate with their targeted wallet addresses through a decentralized notification service facilitated by EPNS protocol. Notifications can be customized based on requirements and could be used to let users know when a buy/sell/swap order of their cryptocurrencies gets confirmed, when an NFT gets minted, when there is a new governance proposal, and more.\\n\\nWith this new way of adding Web3 features on top of social media, we anticipate few trends that will increase the need for decentralized notifications.\\n\\n1.  More exciting projects built on top of a wider range of social media networks would evolve.\\n2.  More innovation along various use cases of DeFi tools on top of various internet platforms.\\n3.  With massive adoption of these tools over various platforms on the internet, online shopping sites might also lean towards supporting cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nWe believe in providing a strong decentralized communication channel for a seamless privacy-protected experience through EPNS. By closely working with the team of Mask Network, we hope to refine EPNS protocol to meet the expectations of users and services.\\n\\n# About Ethereum Push Notification Service\\n\\nEPNS is a decentralized notification protocol that enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications. Using the protocol, any dApp, service or smart contract can send notifications to users in a platform agnostic fashion (mobile, tablet, web, user wallets, etc). The DeFi aspect of the protocol ensures that the user receives notifications and also earns from them.\\n\\nStay in touch!

EPNS enables applications and users to create and subscribe to notification channels, enabling blockchain-native communication between apps and users. The Web3 ecosystem today communicates through channels like email, Medium, Twitter, Discord, WeChat, and more. For rapidly-evolving use cases like DeFi, these forms of communication struggle to scale. EPNS protocol lets applications send push notifications to users regarding updates, account information, product drops, and more. Users can also set up custom notifications in response to on-chain events to better monitor investments, transactions, app security, protocol performance, and more.\\n\\n$PUSH is the native governance token of the EPNS protocol. PUSH provides its holders with two primary benefits: **governance rights** and **reward accrual**. Following the network token generation event, PUSH holders will be able to participate in the evolution of the EPNS protocol and earn rewards from the fees paid to the network.\\n\\n# **Reward Accrual**\\n\\nThe EPNS platform consists of _services, channels,_ and _subscribers._ Services are dapps or smart contracts that wish to send notifications. Services set up _channels_ that send notifications when certain events happen or parameters are met. _Subscribers_ are the users that sign up to those channels and elect to receive notifications.\\n\\nWhen services set up a channel, they must deposit at least 50 DAI into a common staking pool. The common staking pool is an aggregation of the fees from all channels across the EPNS protocol. The common staking pool is then staked in AAVE (at the time of launch), where it accrues value. Accrued DAI is distributed to subscribers of EPNS channels in proportion to how early they joined. Fees are implemented when services close channels, to disincentivize gaming.\\n\\nThe EPNS protocol also has the _fee pool,_ which is tied to $PUSH ownership. The fee pool is a collection of micro-payments paid by services either in a per-notification or yearly subscription model. Fees are paid in DAI or ETH, and collected in the fee pool. The fee pool is distributed to the community. 70% goes to $PUSH holders and 30% goes to the ecosystem development fund. The fee pool will not be live with mainnet launch, and will be activated within a year or so following the protocol\u2019s launch.\\n\\n# **Governance Rights**\\n\\n$PUSH also gives owners the right to vote on protocol decisions, including the staking structure, staking mechanism, and reward distribution rates. Governance votes can include the structure of the fees paid by services (i.e. per notification or yearly subscription), the DeFi mechanism for the staking pool (i.e. staking through AAVE or elsewhere), and other critical incentivization and financial elements of the protocol.\\n\\nLearn more about EPNS and $PUSH in our [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io/).\\n\\n> Update: Token Generation Event Announced!

In the last year alone, we have seen an unprecedented amount of on-chain activity, prompting acute needs from users to keep on top of what is happening. EPNS is poised to accelerate the adoption of the DeFi ecosystem to meet the needs of users and dapps to keep up with rapid innovation.\\n\\nTowards this effort, we are excited to announce that we are working with Uniswap to develop the core [EPNS](http://epns.io) protocol. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) is among the strongest teams and protocols in the Web3 space, and we are looking forward to working with the team to refine the EPNS protocol to create sustainable, decentralized notifications.\\n\\nIn May 2020, Uniswap launched V2 of its protocol. The launch required a significant communications and ecosystem management effort, as the successful launch of the V2 AMM required the migration of liquidity providers (LPs) from V1 to V2. The migration of LPs was successful due to Uniswap\u2019s clear information and community visibility \u2014 but it still took months to happen.\\n\\nRetrospectively, Uniswap\u2019s V2 migration could have been aided by a notification service, which would have provided both Uniswap and LPs a single source for information and communication. Instead of relying on tweets, Telegram messages, and blog posts to get in front of LPs, Uniswap would be able to identify just the V1 LP wallets of the need to migrate to V2. At the time, there existed no native, on-chain way to inform specific eligible wallets. With EPNS, Uniswap could have enabled notifications to be sent to eligible wallets to better ensure communication and engagement around the migration. We are working with the Uniswap team to build out the core EPNS protocol to deliver decentralized notifications to Web3 users. Among those possible notifications, we anticipate enabling a notification system for future versions of Uniswap.\\n\\nDuring our \u201cpilot program\u201d collaboration with Uniswap, we will build a channel for them with EPNS (see our [litepaper](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-whitepaper/blob/master/Ethereum%20Push%20Notification%20Service%20Litepaper.pdf) for definitions of channels, services, and more). Anyone can subscribe to the Uniswap channel and begin receiving notifications to their wallets immediately. The notifications are customizable, and can include letting users know when their transactions have been approved, warning them about gas costs, notifying them of impermanent loss, and much more. By building this channel in collaboration with the Uniswap team, we will also have the opportunity to better understand precisely what dapps want from the EPNS protocol.\\n\\nIn the future, we anticipate a few trends that will increase the need for decentralized notifications.\\n\\n1.  **The DeFi ecosystem will continue to grow and innovate.** In the last year alone, the ecosystem has seen the rise of governance tokens and the blending of DeFi and NFTs. This sort of novelty will not only continue, it will accelerate.\\n2.  **Uniswap will continue to play a critical role in the evolution of the DeFi space.** Uniswap has been a tremendous steward among blue chip DeFi projects, and will continue to be at the forefront of innovation in DeFi. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to grow, we anticipate Uniswap to be at the forefront of much of that innovation.\\n3.  **Other protocols will follow suit and innovate on their own.** DeFi is highly collaborative, and protocols are quick to adopt the behaviors that have proven successful for other dapps. We anticipate a successful innovation pioneered by one company to be swiftly adopted by others.\\n\\nAltogether, the growing DeFi ecosystem we envision needs a way for users to separate the signal from the noise. EPNS is that solution. We are humbled and grateful to be collaborating with one of the brightest teams in the space to build precisely what the ecosystem needs: a decentralized notification service optimized to connect Web3 users and dapps.\\n\\n**_Pilot Program Updates_** **_as of June 24th, 2021_**\\n\\nWith Uniswap we implemented EPNS decentralized notifications to let users know when a new proposal is submitted.\\n\\n![First Image of Accelerating DeFi with EPNS](./image-1.gif)\\n\\nBy making use of the Call to Action feature users will be able to go directly to the proposal with 1 click.\\n\\nIn this case we hooked directly with Uniswap\u2019s V2 contracts.\\n\\nCurrently, we are exploring implementing EPNS for more use cases available with V3 including sending notifs when the LP provider range of trading curve goes out, ie: they are unable to earn any fees.\\n\\n**About Uniswap**\\n\\nUniswap is a protocol on Ethereum for swapping ERC20 tokens without the need for buyers and sellers to create demand.

Soon, we will be releasing another post with information about the sale date and instructions for how to whitelist prior to the sale.\\n\\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is a protocol for decentralized notifications on the Ethereum blockchain. EPNS enables applications and users to create and subscribe to notification channels, enabling blockchain-native communication between apps and users. The Web3 ecosystem today communicates through channels like email, Medium, Twitter, Discord, WeChat, and more. For rapidly-evolving use cases like DeFi, these forms of communication struggle to scale. EPNS protocol lets applications send push notifications to users regarding updates, account information, product drops, and more. Users can also set up custom notifications in response to on-chain events to better monitor investments, transactions, app security, protocol performance, and more.\\n\\n$PUSH is the native governance token for the EPNS protocol. $PUSH grants its owners voting rights over core functionalities of the protocol, in addition to revenue accrued as network fees. For notifications sent through the protocol, micro-fees are gathered from the service providers. Fees are distributed in a ratio of 70% for $PUSH holders and 30% for the ecosystem development pool. $PUSH governance can vote on fee structures and more.\\n\\nSince the earliest days of EPNS, we\u2019ve been extremely fortunate to have the support and backing of the awesome Web3 community. As a community, you\u2019ve shared invaluable feedback and \ud83d\udc96 to help us grow in this journey. Thank you for your support and encouragement!\\n\\nJust a couple of days ago, we announced the completion of our 10x oversubscribed [extended seed](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-closes-10x-oversubscribed-extended-seed-round-ae03c60ae0f8) round, which followed our [initial seed round](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ethereum-push-notification-service-successfully-raises-750k-usd-in-seed-round-bec41eadd84d). We raised $1.41 Million USD from the 2 rounds with support from top blockchain VC\u2019s and Web3 angel investors. A few highlights of our journey so far:\\n\\n- We\u2019re backed by 35+ top VCs and Web3 Angel investors including **Balaji** **Srinivasan** (former Coinbase CTO; a16z General Partner; Co-founder of Earn, Counsyl, Teleport), **True** **Ventures**, **Binance Labs**, **IOSG**, **Bixin, Kenneth** **Ng** (Ethereum Foundation), **Sandeep Nailwal** (Co-founder, **Polygon**), **Mariano** **Conti** (former MakerDAO Head of Smart Contracts), **Anthony** **Sassano** (EthHub; TheDailyGwei), **DeFiDad** ( Zapper.fi COO), **Ajit** **Tripathi** (Head of Institutional Business, **AAVE**), **Scott** **Moore** (Gitcoin Co-founder), **Ravindra** (Frontier Wallet), **Preethi** **Kasireddy** (former a16z Partner), **Auryn** **Macmillan** (Gnosis), **Luka Sucic**, **TheLAO**, **MetaCartel** **VC, Fourth Revolution Capital, Moonwhale Ventures, D64 Ventures, LD Capital, BR Capital** and [more](https://epns.io/).\\n- We are grateful for the support and guidance we\u2019ve received from our Advisors.

While rDai took the very first step in streaming Compound interest in DeFi, programmable cashflows enable many new use cases in other avenues like crypto payrolls, subscriptions or even dispensing weekly rewards at scale!\\n\\nFinancial operations like subscriptions, salaries, rewards, and any composable stream of value usually require many repetitive and expensive transactions to be processed on-chain. Enter [Superfluid Protocol](http://www.superfluid.finance/), an Ethereum based framework that creates transparency into the flow of any recurring transactions, allowing a clear view into the flow and stream of money. By publishing a single transaction, a user could agree to transfer 10 DAI per month in a constant stream. With every second, a tiny amount of DAI will flow between the two wallets, without any need for gas or any further transactions by either the sender or the receiver.\\n\\nWe\u2019re thrilled to announce our partnership with the Superfluid team to further empower the protocol by adding the communication layer powered by Ethereum Push Notification Protocol. This will enable users to not only receive stream but also decentralized notifications to their wallet addresses informing them about important information about any particular money stream along with several other important communications.\\n\\nOur pilot program with Superfluid will consist of:\\n\\n- Exploring adding automated notification capabilities triggered by the basic functions available in the Superfluid Protocol. Such as: Starting, Editing and Cancelling a stream.\\n- Working with the Superfluid team to enable technical discussion towards building a decentralized communication layer that is scalable and powerful.\\n\\nSuperfluid adds a new building block that is poised to change the game and allow builders to create a whole new generation of DeFi applications. We are honored with this amazing opportunity of working together with the Superfluid team in developing **Real Time Finance**.\\n\\n> \u201cEnabling a direct communication channel between dApps and users is crucial, but has always been a tricky problem due to the reluctance of users to associate their email and ethereum account. EPNS solves this brilliantly, and will allow us to drastically improve our User Experience.\u201d \u2014 _Francesco Renzi, CEO Superfluid_\\n\\n**About Superfluid**\\n\\nSuperfluid is a new DeFi primitive that automates recurring transactions, the protocol introduces a series of building blocks for web3 developers to enable real-time finance. Superfluid smart contract framework unlocks idle capital by enabling users to move assets on-chain and apply predefined rules called \u201cagreements\u201d to asset transfers. Superfluid only requires one on-chain transaction to open, edit or close a subscription, greatly decreasing the cognitive and administrative efforts that would have been involved for other types of recurring payments.

Why is it important for the future of Ethereum?](./cover-image.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nAn EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) is a design document that provides information and technical specifications to the Ethereum community describing/proposing a new feature or changes to be made to Ethereum, or its processes, or environment. It is used as the change management/governance mechanism within the Ethereum ecosystem, which allows the community to propose, discuss, and decide whether to finally accept the proposal or withdraw it.\\n\\nIf you have been following the recent conversations within the Ethereum community, you may have come across the term EIP-1559, and there seems to be quite a lot of discussion on this topic. In this article, we try to briefly explain what EIP-1559 is, what the discussion and debate is all about within the Ethereum ecosystem.\\n\\n# **What is EIP-1559?**\\n\\nEIP-1559 is an EIP proposed by Vitalik Buterin and Eric Conner, in an attempt to greatly improve the user experience (UX) of transactions in the Ethereum ecosystem. The proposal aims to do this by changing the current \u201cgas-fee auction\u201d model (similar to Bitcoin). In the gas fee auction model, users bid for block space to include their transactions in the next block by increasing their gas limits and hence incentivizing miners to choose that transaction rather than one with lesser gas fees. The change that the EIP aims to push forward is to do away with the current model, and instead introduce a BASEFEE, which algorithmically adjusts itself based on the network congestion at that time. This means that if Ethereum is utilized by more than 50% then the BASEFEE increases and if the network is congested by less than 50% then the BASEFEE decreases. This would mean that gas prices would be set automatically by the network and users do not have to individually input their gas limit. With the introduction of BASEFEE, we would fundamentally get a \u201cmarket price\u201d for gas at the time. This also means that wallets no longer need to develop and estimate their own algorithms to show an estimate of the network congestion, but rather the BASEFEE itself shows the exact gas fee required to execute a transaction in the network.\\n\\nFrom an end-user perspective, users no longer need to manually input gas price, but rather just click \u201cSend Transaction\u201d if they are willing to pay the gas at the current market price.\\n\\nThe proposal however has not done away with the fee auction model entirely as users who would like to get first in line can pay a TIP to the miner to incentivize them to add their transaction into the block first. As [Eric Conner](https://twitter.com/econoar), co-founder of [EthHub](https://ethhub.io/) puts it, \u201cIn times of high network usage, a user can ensure that their transaction is included sooner by including a larger tip along with the BASEFEE amount. Meanwhile, users who are not in a hurry can set a maximum fee that they\u2019re willing to pay. The protocol will then wait for the BASEFEE to drop below this number before confirming their transaction.\u201d.\\n\\nOne major attack vector with the model mentioned up to now is that miners could potentially collude and artificially clog the network with fake transactions in an attempt to drive the algorithmically set BASEFEE, and hence extract more from users. In order to prevent this situation, EIP-1559 also brings the additional measure of burning the BASEFEE, while any TIP goes to the miner.\\n\\nCurrently, miners are compensated for securing the network with the sum of block rewards and all the transaction fees of all transactions included in the block, but this would change with EIP-1559, as the miners would only receive block rewards, and TIPS if any.\\n\\nHence EIP-1559 does these 2 things:\\n\\n- Creates \u201c**a market rate**\u201d for block inclusion\\n- **Burns ETH** in the transaction fee\\n\\n# W**hy is this EIP important?**\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, this EIP aims to drastically improve the UX for end-users, by algorithmically setting the BASEFEE such that wallets no longer need to estimate gas fees by approximating the network congestion. Although, there seems to be a misconception that EIP-1559 would result in the reduction of gas fees, which is not the case. The EIP according to Eric Conner, aims to provide wallets and users a much-needed improvement to the user-experience of gas management. This means that rather than having spikes of high gas fees during high network congestion, the graph is smoothened out, but it still doesn\u2019t reduce the gas fees, nor does it provide more scalability.\\n\\nAnother critical aspect of the proposal is the burning of the BASEFEE, which would be the majority of the transaction fees, as only some users of the network may provide TIPS to the miners to be favored for block inclusion. This eventually reduces the supply of ETH circulating in the network and hence makes ETH more valuable for all ETH holders. This makes ETH potentially deflationary if the amount of BASEFEE burnt is greater than the block rewards received by miners for mining a new block, hence adding to ETH\u2019s scarcity.\\n\\nBut Eric Conners once again steps into the limelight to clear the misconception that the reason EIP-1559 needs to be implemented is that it burns ETH. He argues that the main point of the EIP is enhanced UX, but the burning of ETH is just a nice add-on that shouldn\u2019t take center stage, and that once Ethereum scaling arrives, the fee burnt will be less eventually hence making ETH inflationary once again.\\n\\n# **#STOPEIP1559 vs #SUPPORTEIP1559**\\n\\nYou may have recently come across these #tag campaigns as you scroll through Twitter recently. What is the problem with EIP-1559 that has sparked such controversy among folks in the Ethereum ecosystem?\\n\\nThe uproar against EIP-1559 comes from a part of the miner community mainly led by a small mining pool called \u201cFlexpool\u201d. The reason for the uproar is mainly due to the fact that on implementation of EIP-1559, miners lose a portion of their revenue as the BASEFEE gets burnt, hence making miners dependent on block rewards as well as TIPS.\\n\\nRecently, Flexpool set up a [website](https://stopeip1559.org/) to voice their discontent #STOPEIP1559 with the proposal and asked other mining pools to join their stand as well. As a counter to this campaign #SUPPORTEIP1559 has been asking the rest of the community to voice their support for EIP-1559 as it the EIP would help in creating a better UX for all parties involved in the Ethereum ecosystem.\\n\\nOn one hand, we have **_#SupportEIP1559_** which claims that, \u201cDespite the fact that implementation of EIP-1559 would minimally reduce income \u2014 in most forecasts setting it back to levels that would have been common several months ago \u2014 a vocal minority of miners led by **Flexpool wants to arbitrarily increase the base fee** of EIP-1559 and continue to extract painfully high fees from users in order to line their own pockets.\u201c, and has been publicly backed by many in the Ethereum space, including but not limited to AAVE, Loopring, DefiSaver, Dharma, etc.\\n\\nEven well-known personalities in the Ethereum space, such as Anthony Sassano, have voiced their support for the EIP. \u201cMiners are of course an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem as they are key to keeping the network running. In return for this service, they are paid for their work by the network and are the only ones who make money from the network in this way \u2014 no other ecosystem stakeholder gets paid directly by the network. Because of this, they are what I consider to be \u201cservice providers\u201d which quite literally means they exist to _serve_ the network \u2014 the network does not exist to serve them. This is why many in the community are currently annoyed at certain miners for being against this proposal \u2014 they are already making a ton of money from the block reward + fees and want to reject a major upgrade based on a relatively small \u201cpay cut\u201d.\u201d\\n\\nAnd on the other hand, we have a group of miners who stand by **_#StopEIP1559_**, where they claim that \u201cEthereum developers initially needed miners for their coin but once successful they\u2019ve thrown them under the bus. They cared about miners when Ethereum lacked mining support, and once they received it, they started to mistreat them. Large pools support the Ethereum Developers because they have large stores of ETH, making them investors themselves. They do not value their miners because they plan to dump them when 2.0 comes. pools. Miners are no longer vital to the Ethereum developers or big mining pools because they\u2019ve made their money, and now miners are an embarrassment. The developers and big mining pools had forgotten where they came from and supported them when they started out. \u201d, backed by mining pools such as Flexpool, Nanopool, Ethermine, and more.\\n\\nOn February 26th a community call will take place to discuss the implementation of EIP-1559, and Flexpool has been invited on behalf of miners to voice their opinions and to push for a compromise on the issue. As we approach the date for the community call, tensions rise and all eyes are on what the discussion would be and the decisions made by the community during this call.\\n\\n# **In Summary**\\n\\nEIP-1559 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that aims to drastically improve the user-experience of gas management in Ethereum, by removing the current fee auction model for block inclusion but rather introducing a BASEFEE which is algorithmically set according to how much of the network is being utilized at that time and is burnt. The burning of the BASEFEE has sparked a divide within the Ethereum community, between miners and the rest, which resulted in two major campaigns #SUPPORTEIP1559 and #STOPEIP1559 that has been making rounds throughout crypto-twitter. On February 26, 2021, a community call will take place to discuss the implementation of EIP-1559 with participation from Flexpool on behalf of miners to push for a compromise.\\n\\nAs we move closer to February 26th it remains to be seen how this major proposal to change how the Ethereum consensus fundamentally works will play out in the end.\\n\\n## **EDIT: UPDATE ON EIP-1559 STATUS**\\n\\nEthereum Improvement Proposal [(EIP) 1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md) will be packaged with the London hard fork this coming July regardless of the mining industry\u2019s discontent with the proposal, according to the All Core Developers [call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWfR-WxjmYg) Friday.\\n\\nMiners generally seem to be accepting EIP-1559 a community call has revealed today where devs and miners discussed the matter.\\n\\nWang Chun of F2Pool re-iterated his support and in addition, he said supporting ETC in 2016 was a mistake. They now full-on Ethereum backers. Another miner, Chris (?) from Flexpool, said they held a poll which revealed 55.33% of miners accept EIP 1559 if another EIP, 969, is added."},{"id":"why-game-theory-is-the-most-important","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/why-game-theory-is-the-most-important","source":"@site/blog/2021-02-17-why-game-theory-is-the-most-important/index.md","title":"Why Game Theory is the Most Important Thing in a Decentralized Notification Protocol","description":"Why Game Theory is the Most Important Thing in a Decentralized Notification Protocol","date":"2021-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 17, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Game Theory","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/game-theory"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Decentralization","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/decentralization"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Blog","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":6.276666666666666,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"why-game-theory-is-the-most-important","title":"Why Game Theory is the Most Important Thing in a Decentralized Notification Protocol","description":"Why Game Theory is the Most Important Thing in a Decentralized Notification Protocol","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Game theory is the study of rational behavior in situations involving interdependence.

It is a formal way to analyze the interaction among a group of rational individuals who behave strategically. In the simplest of terms, game theory refers to people making rational decisions based on the given information or situation at hand. The concept of game theory can often be confused with general logic and logical reasoning, but it is based on pure mathematics and has applications in any domain where people interact or coordinate with each other, even in business. Initially developed in 1944 by mathematics genius John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in their book _Theory of Games and Economic Behavior,_ game theory was recognized as one of the greatest scientific achievements of the century, as it provided a systematic way to understand the behavior of players in situations where their fortunes are interdependent.\\n\\nIt originally addressed zero-sum games, in which one person\u2019s gains result in losses for the other participants. This can be easily visualized in a game of poker \u2014 any profits gained by a player in a game is caused by the loss of the other players playing in that game.\\n\\n# **The (bizarre) Christmas Truce of 1914**\\n\\nOne of the most historic showcases of game theory was the Christmas Truce of 1914. In 1914, during the First World War, an unofficial truce was declared on Christmas Eve among the men in the trenches from both the rival sides.\\n\\nIn some places, men from both sides of the war ventured into no man\u2019s land on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to mingle, exchange food and souvenirs, and even play with each other all in the spirit of Christmas.\\n\\nThis event in history was later dubbed to be **_\u2018_**[**_The Christmas Truce_**](https://www.vox.com/2014/12/25/7448471/christmas-truce-1914)**_\u2019_**.\\n\\n![First Image of Why Game Theory is the Most Important Thing in a Decentralized Notification Protocol](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nIn this situation, the incentive for soldiers on both sides of the war was that **if everyone cooperates** they could celebrate for a day without any worries, with no discrimination and live a day with no sorrow and acknowledge each other as fellow human beings. A **win-win situation** for all parties involved.\\n\\nThe **penalty** being, not following rules and not cooperating would result in being holed up in trenches and keeping a watch on the enemy throughout this festive day.\\n\\nOne could easily visualize this as below:\\n\\n![Second Image of Why Game Theory is the Most Important Thing in a Decentralized Notification Protocol](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nThe soldiers know that if they disregard the truce and initiate a **_\u201csurprise attack\u201d_** they could possibly do lots of damage and gain a significant advantage (_as denoted by the top-right and bottom-left cells_), but they also realize that if the other side also is prepared for an attack, **nobody wins** and Christmas would be just like any other day during the war. To them, the optimal solution, in this case, would be to go through with the truce and ensure a win-win situation for all parties involved and have a jolly Christmas.\\n\\nAlthough this agreement deteriorated slowly in the following years as the war got more aggressive, the Christmas Eve of 1914 shows us how a simple consensus for peace and happiness and celebrating humanity even for a day can be rationalized.\\n\\n# **Game Theory in Blockchain and Decentralized Technology**\\n\\nThe goal of game theory for blockchain systems and protocols is to build networks that need no oversight by modeling and predicting human reasoning and yet have positive outcomes for the greater good. This is done with the help of coordination games or by achieving a Nash Equilibrium in a non-zero-sum game, and by aligning stakeholder incentives in such a way that any action that they perform for their **self-gain** would result in the **gain of the entire system at large.**\\n\\nCoordination games are strategic games with multiple Nash equilibria. Nash equilibrium (named after John Forbes Nash Jr.) is an outcome of a strategic game in which none of the participants wants to change their choice of actions, given the actions of the other players. In other words, each player plays a best-response strategy by assuming the other player\u2019s moves. In the Nash Equilibrium, each player is assumed to know the strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy.\\n\\nLet us first explore what economists actually consider as a **_game_**.\\n\\nA game according to an economist \u2014 [_as explained by Dr. Stephanie Hurder_](https://medium.com/prysmeconomics/nash-equilibrium-and-blockchain-d6a6f47a7a37) \u2014 satisfies these criteria:\\n\\n1.  A game must have 2 or more players\\n2.  Each participant is going to choose among several actions available to them.\\n3.  The goal of each participant is to choose the action or mix of actions that maximize their payoffs.\\n4.  Each participant\u2019s choice of action determines the payoff that he/she gets in the game and the payoffs of the other participants in the game.\\n5.  All participants choose their actions in isolation, and their choices are only revealed to each other after all choices are made.\\n\\nWhen a participant is playing a game, their payoff-maximizing choice depends on what they believe that the other participants will do, and knows that their choice will affect the optimal choices of their opponents.\\n\\nHere, a payoff can be anything that can be represented by numbers \u2014 revenue, profit, tokens, or anything else that the participants would prefer to have more of.\\n\\nBlockchain, by being decentralized, becomes a **collaborative technology** that thrives on coordination and collaboration of participants in the network, who are themselves driven for their self-gain but also by doing so contribute to the overall success of the network. An example of this is evident in Bitcoin. Bitcoin incentivizes miners to use their computing power to secure the network by rewarding them with bitcoins \u2014 this is an economic incentive. Bitcoin makes mining intentionally difficult and inefficient, thus making it costly for malicious actors. In this way, it makes sure that the miners do not deviate from protocol and hence makes the network more secure.\\n\\nThis game-theoretical thinking of promoting good behavior and punishing bad exists in daily life, as we\u2019ve built societies to reward work that we value and deter behavior that we don\u2019t. Hence, game theory plays a very important role in governing decentralized protocols and ensuring that all participants in the network act for the benefit of the protocol.\\n\\n# **The Game Theory in EPNS**\\n\\nEPNS has designed its protocol in such a way that the incentives are aligned for all participants in the network, which makes its governance effective, and self-sustaining for the long run.\\n\\nThe game theory of governance is designed keeping in mind all participating users of the EPNS ecosystem. The more users the protocol has, the more services will come leading to an increase in fees pool and rewards leading to a direct impact on the token utility as the token is intrinsically linked to protocol growth, being a key medium of exchange for all activities occurring thereon.\\n\\nAs mentioned in the [_Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) Whitepaper_](https://whitepaper.epns.io/), **$PUSH** tokens, the **protocol\u2019s native governance tokens** are used to control various core functionalities of the protocol. The fees are charged in **$ETH** or **$DAI** within the protocol but the control to change the various fees lies with the governance token holders.\\n\\nAll fees collected from the EPNS protocol usage forms the **Fees pool** and will be distributed in the following proportion:\\n\\n**30%** for the Ecosystem development pool\\n\\n**Ecosystem development pool (EDP)** = **x%** for Integration partners pool\\n\\n**y%** for Future integration reward pool\\n\\nWhere **x%** \\\\+ **y%** \\\\= **100%** of **EDP**\\n\\nThe incentive layer of the EPNS protocol is designed as follows for the different ecosystem participants.\\n\\n1.  **Service Providers** \u200bare already incentivized to send notifications as it brings them on par with the web2 experience, and with platform-agnostic and incentivized notifications, we can even go ahead and state that EPNS betters the current notification game of web2 / centralized. The subsection of this will also be \u200b**vendors** \u200bwho are third party developers that will be creating channels to capitalize on liquidity mining.\\n2.  **Users**\u200b are incentivized as they want to receive notifications related to payments, DeFi, gaming, or service\u200b \u200bon web3. As can be seen by traditional services (web 2) and the rampant use of notifications to drive engagement which is working and has become a part of all of our daily lives. Users also benefit by \u200b**receiving token incentives from notifications** \u200band by **universal delivery**\u200b.\\n3.  **Wallets / Infra Services**\\n\\n- **Existing Wallets / Services** \u200bare incentivized to continue performing as that ensures their perpetual share from the integration partners pool.\\n- **Future Wallets** \u200bare incentivized to integrate with the growing reward pool of **EDP**, \u200bas\u200b \u200bit gets higher over time as more fee flows in the protocol (as more and more notifications are sent). This creates an incentive for future wallets to consider integration to the protocol to claim this reward and also to move a proposal to have a perpetual share in the Integration partners pool.\\n- **Note:** \u200bThe integration in turn drives more users to the protocol which drives more services and thus an increase in the fees pool which starts the cycle of future wallets integration again.\\n\\n**Token Holders** \u200bare incentivized to keep and to pass the best proposal and keep core features fees competitive at the best rate possible as they gain the most of all the participating users are properly incentivized as it drives utility to the protocol and the usage of the protocol.\\n\\nIn this way, for EPNS \u2014 a decentralized notifications platform \u2014 game theory becomes very important in order to effectively align stakeholder incentives in both business and economical sense in order to enhance network effects and drive more users and services to the platform.\\n\\n# **Takeaways**\\n\\nGame theory is the study of rational behavior in situations involving interdependence. Blockchain, by being decentralized, becomes a collaborative technology that thrives on coordination and collaboration of participants in the network, who are themselves driven for their self-gain but also by doing so contribute to the overall success of the network. The goal of game theory for blockchain systems and protocols is to build networks that need no oversight by modeling and predicting human reasoning and yet have positive outcomes for the greater good. EPNS being a decentralized notifications protocol uses game theory in order to generate network effects and creates a win-win situation for all parties involved in the ecosystem, be it users, services, wallet providers, or token holders.\\n\\n## **BONUS!**\\n\\nIf you made it this far and would like to learn more about how game theory works, check out this game \u2014 The Evolution of Trust ( [https://ncase.me/trust/](https://ncase.me/trust/) ) \u2014 that explores how different personalities and relationships of trust can create different outcomes in different games, and also it illustrates how important it is to align incentives in such a way that we create a win-win situation for all.

Can you provide a brief introduction to the core team behind EPNS?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nAwesome! I mentioned my intro above owing to the excitement but here it is again \ud83d\ude05: I am Harsh, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service. Some background about me, I love dabbling in all things tech; and have been fortunate enough to have the support from the awesome Ethereum and blockchain community to have been given the chance to create/change the communication layer for Ethereum and Web3 which we like to call as The Missing Piece of Web3.0\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nVery Impressive\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nI am the co-founder of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS). I wear multiple hats at EPNS though am focused on mostly Marketing, Growth and Product. Stoked to be #BUIDLing World\u2019s First Decentralized Notification Protocol. Looking forward to some awesome questions.\\n\\nEPNS Journey so far: We have had an awesome journey! Ideation and loads of research were taken to Ethereum Foundation -> EthGlobal HackMoney 2020 where we build POC -> selected for IDEO PVD -> selected for Gitcoin Kernel fellowship and came out as top 20 projects! -> entered Gitcoin Grant round 7 (top 5 projects / 210+ contributors) which led us to raise our seed!!!\\n\\nReally happy and grateful to share that we recently completed our seed round and were honored to get backing from notable web3 leaders including Balaji Srinivasan (Fmr CTO of Coinbase, General Partner at a16z. Cofounder of Earn, Counsyl, Teleport), Kenneth Ng (Ethereum Foundation), Scott Moore (Co-founder, Gitcoin), Mariano Conti (Fmr Head of Smart Contracts, MakerDAO), Anthony Sassano (EthHub / TheDailyGwei), DeFiDad (COO, Zapper), Ravindra (Frontier Wallet), Preethi Kasireddy (Fmr Partner at a16z), Auryn Macmillan (Gnosis), TheLAO, MetaCartel VC, BR Capital, 4RC and several more awesome peeps!\\n\\nSo, yeah, we had an amazing time so far and I think it was all due to the community love and support for which we are forever grateful and indebted \ud83d\ude4f!\\n\\nYou can learn more about our team, Advisors and very awesome Investors and backers on our website [epns.io](https://epns.io/)\\n\\nthank you \u263a\ufe0f\\n\\n![First Image of AMA with Decentralized Club \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nAmazing\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\nYou\u2019re welcome\ud83d\ude09\\n\\nOk, can we go on to next question\ud83d\ude4b?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nDone\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nNext question\ud83d\ude4b\\n\\nQ2. Can you talk a bit about what services does EPNS offers and how customers can subscribe to it ?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) in its core is a decentralized communication protocol that enables any smart contracts, dApps or even traditional services to send notifications to wallet addresses\u2026 as long as those wallet addresses have opted in to receive them from a particular service.\\n\\nThere is also a DeFi aspect to the protocol that is used to enable incentives or passive earnings for the users along with receiving these decentralized notifications.\\n\\nhow customers can subscribe to it ?\\n\\nBeing a communication middleware, users have to visit [https://app.epns.io](https://app.epns.io/) and subscribe (opt in) for notifications from a channel (services that want to send notifs). The next step is receiving those notifs for which users can download our iOS or Android app and they are ready to go! (check out [https://epns.io](https://epns.io/) for relevant links).\\n\\nDropping the teaser cause we worked really hard to make it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwwnlmUpRsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwwnlmUpRsk)\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nAmazing \ud83d\ude0e It shows a lot of transparency\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\n\ud83d\ude4f\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nNext question :\\n\\nQ3. Can you throw some light to how many subscribers are currently utilizing EPNS services and what\u2019s their feedback ?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nWe are currently live on ropsten as an alpha and users can subscribe to their favorite channels and get live notifications! We have over 500 users on the protocol and counting!\\n\\nSome of the awesome channels we currently have (channels are services sending notifs to their subscribers) are Wallet Movement Tracker, ETHGas Tracker, ETH/BTC Price, ENS Domain Expiry and more are coming soon! All of them getting delivered pseudo anonymously to a user wallet address just like how web3 communication should be :).\\n\\nFeedback is awesome, services wanted this on web3 for a long time and users are now able to get notifs which we all have come to love and rely upon when we do anything virtual!\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nCool \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nLast question of introduction :\\n\\nQ4. What is further planned for EPNS in 2021 ?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nWe have loads of awesome features planned for 2021 and beyond \u26a1\ufe0f. The main ones include TGE, and of course Audit and Mainnet. Loads of incoming features L2 intgeration. A detailed roadmap is in progress and will be shared very soon on our tg channel ([https://t.me/epnsproject](https://t.me/epnsproject))\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nThank you [@harshr](http://twitter.com/harshr) [@RJlwl](http://twitter.com/RJlwl), super insightful and very easy to understand.\\n\\n# \ud83d\udc27 Community ask Questions by Twitter \u2714\ufe0f\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nTwitter question no 1.  \\nUsername : [@Wormz28](http://twitter.com/Wormz28)\\n\\nHow can you say or believe that almost any application in the Web3 ecosystem can benefit from notifications? Can you give some of the highest-impact immediate opportunities in using a DECENTRALIZED PUSH NOTIFICATIONS?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nCommunication from services to the users has been a game changer since notifications were introduced in 2010. If you think about any web2.0 interaction you have in the virtual life, chances are that it began with notifs. For instance: even this TG AMA is getting to many users through notifications! There are many more examples: like the payments you make, your social media interactions, any application you are on and even your facetime calls and messages, they all rely on notifs to get to you!\\n\\nContract this to web3 and you start seeing the importance of communications, the lack of it causes so many pain points including your loans getting liquidated, governance proposals getting missed, ENS domains getting expired, staking rewards getting missed, security audits not reaching the users and many many more!\\n\\nIn essence, a lot of innovative products are being deployed on Blockchain & Web3 especially when it comes to DeFi but they all still face the issue of not being able to communicate with users directly. This tends to be a huge barrier for mainstream adoption, and for customer retention and engagement rates.\\n\\nEven in DeFi alone, we see these to hugely benefit from notifications:\\n\\n\\\\- Near Liquidation Alert (Borrowers & Liquidators),  \\n\\\\- Staking Rewards Available to Claim (Stakers),  \\n\\\\- Staking Rewards About to Expire (Stakers),  \\n\\\\- Price Alerts (Traders),  \\n\\\\- Stablecoin Peg Slippage (Arbitragers),  \\n\\\\- Low Gas Cost (Devs, ETH Power Users),  \\n\\\\- Rebalances (Token Set Users),  \\n\\\\- Index Selection/Weighting Changes (Index Users),  \\n\\\\- Token/Contract Migrations (Protocol Users),  \\n\\\\- Governance Updates, Token Launches,  \\n\\\\- New Collateral Types on Money Markets,  \\n\\\\- New Liquidity Mining Incentives,  \\n\\\\- Yield Farming APY alerts,  \\n\\\\- Escrow Periods Ending / Tokens Coming Unlocked\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nTwitter question no 2.  \\nUsername : [@RahulJayaraj9](http://twitter.com/RahulJayaraj9)\\n\\nInnovation, development, value, from those three things which part do you prioritize the most? And can you explain the reason?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nThis is tricky for a startup to answer! It really depends on phases imo. At the start, innovation is definitely needed otherwise you aren\u2019t really solving a problem. Though right after, you have to do development but in the start you have 1000 things to develop and of course that means picking those development tasks that can drive higher value. This is not to say that the other dev tasks won\u2019t be done but as I said, all of three of these play a huge part though at different phases of a start up cycle. I think currently we are at the value phase.\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nTwitter question no 3.  \\nUsername : [@ShaneNane707](http://twitter.com/ShaneNane707)\\n\\nLiquidity, transaction fees and delays are always important factors in financial services. How does EPNS solve the above problems to attract users?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nAwesome question and one of the reason for EPNS to exist. For transaction fees, we already are working on L2 and that should take care of scalability and fees unless a mainnet contract wants to send notif (in which case, having 0.1% higher fees for including alerts shouldn\u2019t be an issue). For Liquidity, I am not sure whether it\u2019s related to us as we are a communication middleware with DeFi aspect and not a DeFi protocol :).\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nDone!\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nAnd to add -: EPNS forms a critical piece of web3 infrastructure. Imagine new liquidity pools being created on Uniswap or ethereum gas fees coming down or any new / emergency Governance proposal coming up (remb YAM!!). EPNS can ensure communicating such time critical and financial impact updates and news to the users.\\n\\nDONE\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf0d Community ask question by Website \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nWebsite question no 1.  \\nFrom : Sunidhi Jena\\n\\nHow can a user control what notifications he needs in EPNS ?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nYes! we understand the problem users face when it comes to unsolicited and spam notifications \ud83d\ude05. We actually thought a ton about it and there are a couple of ways by which we mitigate the issue (everything happens on protocol \ud83d\ude0a):\\n\\n1. Users have to opt in to receive notifications from the service first before they can start communicating. This ensures that users are always in control, if they unsubscribe, there is no way for a service to add to them.\\n\\n2. To ensure that a service doesn\u2019t turn malicious later on, we attach a Spam Score to them as well which is adjusted by both positive (higher number of subscribers, the passage of time, etc) and negative (unusual number of notifications, a higher number of unsubscribes, etc) actions. This score when it crosses a certain threshold activates the protocol throttle mechanism which is a way to penalize services a bit at first and if they don\u2019t stop then making the throttling go high thereby ensuring that it\u2019s always in the best interest of services to not spam their users.\\n\\nWe are also planning verified badges in the future to ensure that while everyone can create a channel and everyone can opt-in, there is a distinction between spammy channels and verified ones.\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nWebsite question no 2.  \\nFrom : Samuel lux\\n\\nIs there a certain credibility system assigned to a subscription service using which we can understand if it\u2019s spam or legit ?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nhehe, I think Richa covered this in the first questions itself :D. In short, we attach a spam score as described above to throttle notifications from the protocol itself in case a service starts spamming the users. The last option being removing the service through our on-chain governance. This combined with user always in control ensures that it\u2019s in the best interst of the service to stay complaint!\\\\\\\\\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nWebsite question no 3.  \\nFrom : Annayna Bhakta\\n\\nHow did you came up this project idea ?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nThe genesis of the idea was when we sat down to observe what, if any pain points still exist in the way blockchain apps (dApps / smart contracts / services) that we can solve. We were quick to realize that something felt a bit odd and narrowed it down soon to how Web3 tech behaved a lot like the early days of the internet.\\n\\nThink 2004ish when GMail was launched and changed inboxes forever. At that point of time, the internet was still growing and services offered there behaved exactly the same way it does so in Web3 right now. For instance, you as a user were expected to login to the mailbox to check the email, reply to friends / work and then come back to it sometime and rinse and repeat. If you were the trendy one back in those days then maybe you went to myspace and orkut as well! But no matter the service, you were always going back to check on your actions.\\n\\nThis drastically changed with notifications in 2010. All of a sudden, services began to reach out to users whenever an action was required from their end, it increased engagement rate to 7x and massively improved user experience. Notifications have been so engraved into our lives now that we hardly realize most of our online actions are caused by them, think about it, whatsapp, facetime, emails, payments, games all inform you now. You don\u2019t go back to them to check it out.\\n\\nContrast this experience with any dApps, smart contracts or services you interact with on web3. There\u2019s no way to inform users(wallet addresses) any time an important event occurs, instead, the user is assumed to go back to the service time and time again to check their activity. For instance, Liquidation on AAVE, Compound or any DeFi, DAO Governance proposal (Yam!), or ENS / dEx orders. Each of these are a reality right now but no solution exists to address them and the problem will only worsen as more services come to Web3.\\n\\nThis was the moment that we realized that this stone age era of communication in blockchain needs to go\u2026you are not foreclosed by your bank without proper notices that reach you, but DeFi while enabling awesome use cases does that to you ohh so often and we wanted to fix that. With this new found observable knowledge, and the destiny which led us here from being a mobile app entrepreneur in 2010 and seeing the transformation notifications had, we kind of understood that this is what we are meant to create and thus Ethereum Push Notifications Service (EPNS) was born.\\n\\n# \u270d\ufe0f Telegram live Questions answered by EPNS \u2714\\n\\nKop:  \\n\ud83d\udea9Q.Many projects rug pulled and exit scam recently. Why should investors trust your project not to do the same?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 That\u2019s a great question! I would suggest all investors to really not trust anyone and instead to their own research! Crypto being the wild west, it is essential for anyone to dig around before investing! The same applies for our project as well :). Having said that, in addition to doing your own research, some of the ways by which we can be vetted are:\\n\\n\\\\- By looking at our investors list which includes some notable web3 leaders and then ensuring that these investors have indeed spoken about us  \\n\\\\- By looking at our vesting schedules and vesting contracts which will be available soon to ensure that we can\u2019t rug pull even if we want to  \\n\\\\- By asking questions and looking at whitepaper to make sure that it makes technical sense  \\n\\\\- And lastly, by trying the app / protocol out to ensure that the tech is real and not hog wash\\n\\nThough I would again re-iterate that these are some of the ways that we can suggest, in the end, you as a user needs to come up with many many more before you can be sure so always always ensure that you are doing your own research!\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 [@Randy0061](http://twitter.com/Randy0061)  \\nQ: EPNS uses a loan to AAVE to generate interest that is distributed among the subscribers of the service. Percentage-wise, how high is this interest? Are there other incentive protocols that you will employ to entice more users to use EPNS PUSH notifications?\\n\\nWhile designing the EPNS decentralized notification protocol we wanted to design a WIN-WIN scenario for both the Users (receivers of the notifications) as well as Services (senders of the notification). Our protocol requires a service to activate themselves before they can send notifications, this is a one time step and the activation requires deposit a one-time stake fee.  \\nThis stake fee is then automatically lend out to AAVE protocol and starts generating interest. This generated interest is then distributed to the subscribers of the channel (service) in a weighted fashion thus making the notifications incentivized for the users \ud83d\ude42  \\nIn future, we may employ other protocols as well.\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 It\u2019s going to be $PUSH which is governance and reward share token. We are heavy believers of game theory and believe in win-win for everyone in the ecosystem and the token is designed to enable that as well!\\n\\n$PUSH will enable users to govern the protocol, handle game theory between all our participants, and\u2026 \ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41have reward/pool sharing built into it so every player wins!!\\n\\nWe will also have liquidity/usage mining that will reward participants among several other use cases.\\n\\nThey are incoming and not yet out\u2026 we will have an announcement on it pretty soon \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 [@Naia999](http://twitter.com/Naia999)  \\nWhat is business model of your project? How it works? and  \\nWho are your potential customers and which markets are you targeting on?\\n\\nWe are big fans of game theory and ensuring win-win for all actors involved in the ecosystem. This ideology along with building the world\u2019s first decentralized notification protocol meant that we can get creative with our business model which is what we went ahead and did, that is created a business model that supports and rewards all 4 participants of our ecosystem:\\n\\nServices that send notifications: They are rewarded in our governance token $PUSH which is rewarded based on the verified number of user wallets that have subscribed to receive their notifications. This ensure that we not only attract official services (AAVE, Compound, ENS, etc) but also third party developers who have the ability to create useful notifications for the Web3 ecosystem as they are also incentivized to do so\\n\\nUsers who receive notifications: We wanted this to be a user centric protocol at it\u2019s very heart, this means that the protocol values users a lot, this means that the user have a lot of win win scenarios including receiving notifications from the services, getting passive income from receiving notifications, rewarding them in tokens for active ecosystem participation, rewarding them for participating in governance and then some more.\\n\\nInfrastructure / User wallets showing notifications: Our end vision is to have user wallets and any end point that serves as an entry point for Web 3 to start supporting notifications and EPNS protocol. For that, our governance system will ensure a perpetual split in the fees for these as long as they can get the governance proposal passed via on-chain governance. The fees segment is collected and distributed via the protocol and will be borne by the services in future as micro fee per notification, monthly or yearly subscription.\\n\\nGovernance Token Holders: The token holders essentially control the core features of the protocol and decide the way forward, for which the protocol rewards them the most by ensuring that they are rewarded for their efforts and are incentivized to balance the protocol. The rewards to token holders are dis in $PUSH tokens which is converted a part of the fees and thus can be really creative in our business model which is what we did exactly.\\n\\nThe DeFi characteristic of the EPNS protocol incentivizes users to earn rewards. The protocol has $PUSH , a non-refundable functional utility token designed to reward users for continuous involvement and engagement in the adoption of the protocol and to achieve the vision of becoming web3 notification standard. $PUSH will be used as a medium of exchange to interact on the protocol. The token is necessary to vote on the features of the protocol. The protocol fees are charged in $ETH or $DAI within the EPNS protocol, but the $PUSH token holders may vote to change these fee parameters.\\n\\nAs we are a decentralized protocol, the markets are global and decentralized as well \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n# Edited by : \ud83c\udf3fDK\u270d\ufe0f\\n\\nYou can stay update to date and learn about EPNS through the following channels, please join us at.\\n\\n**EPNS Telegram** [https://t.me/epnsproject](https://t.me/epnsproject)\\n\\n**EPNS Twitter** [https://twitter.com/epnsproject](https://twitter.com/epnsproject)"},{"id":"ama-with-satoshi-club","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/ama-with-satoshi-club","source":"@site/blog/2021-02-02-ama-with-satoshi-club/index.md","title":"\ud83c\udf99 AMA with Satoshi Club","description":"\ud83c\udf99 AMA with Satoshi Club","date":"2021-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 2, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ama","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ama"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Crypto","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/crypto"},{"label":"Blog","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":14.56,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"ama-with-satoshi-club","title":"\ud83c\udf99 AMA with Satoshi Club","description":"\ud83c\udf99 AMA with Satoshi Club","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) Founder and Project Lead, Harsh Rajat, and Co-founder, Richa Joshi, joined Satoshi Club community on 30th January 2021 for a live AMA session on their telegram group.

Welcome!  \\nHello guys! \ud83d\ude03\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS**:  \\nThanks, @Cool_as_Ice Really excited to be here!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club**:  \\nHello, Harsh\ud83d\udc4f happy to see you here \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club**:  \\nGood to have you here \ud83d\ude03How are you doing?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nHey Legendary Satoshi Community & @Cool_as_Ice, great to be here \ud83d\udc4b\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nHello! welcome! \ud83e\udd73\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nHello, Risha! Welcome to Satoshi Club \ud83d\udc4f\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nHey @madamlobster doing great, hope you all are having an awesome weekend as well.\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nDo you guys ready to begin our AMA?\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nGuys, could you please introduce yourself and tell us how did you start with EPNS?\ud83d\ude00\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nThanks! Really feels awesome to be here\u2026 Hey awesome Satoshis ;). I am Harsh, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service. Some background about me, I love dabbling in all things tech; and have been fortunate enough to have the support from the awesome Ethereum and blockchain community to have been given the chance to create/change the communication layer for Ethereum and Web3 which we like to call as The missing piece of web3.\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nSure! I am the co-founder of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS). I wear multiple hats at EPNS though am focused on mostly Marketing and Product. Before EPNS, I worked with companies like Deloitte, Wipro, etc., and have close to 12 years of techno-functional experience in various aspects of product management, design, and development across multiple facets of the product lifecycle.\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nA bit about our journey:\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nNice background! Sure it will help EPNS a lot\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nWe have had an awesome journey! We identified this pain point, ie: lack of communication in Web3 in January, Ideation and loads of research took a couple of months after which we took the idea to Ethereum Foundation, there we were lucky to be guided to EthGlobal HackMoney, after which we got selected and mentored by IDEO in their product validation day (PVD) and then got selected in Gitcoin Kernel accelerator/incubator, which is one of the most prestigious accelerators in our space. We are loving this roller coaster ride!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nYes! And I see that your coaster ride is really successful \ud83d\ude00\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nAwesome journey indeed! \ud83d\ude01\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nAlso, really happy and grateful to share that we recently completed our seed round and were honored to get backing from notable web3 leaders including Balaji Srinivasan (Fmr CTO of Coinbase, General Partner at a16z. Cofounder of Earn, Counsyl, Teleport), Kenneth Ng (Ethereum Foundation), Scott Moore (Co-founder, Gitcoin), Mariano Conti (Fmr Head of Smart Contracts, MakerDAO), Anthony Sassano (EthHub / TheDailyGwei), DeFiDad (COO, Zapper), Ravindra (Frontier Wallet), Preethi Kasireddy (Fmr Partner at a16z), Auryn Macmillan (Gnosis), TheLAO, MetaCartel VC and several more awesome peeps!\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nTo learn more about our investors please visit: [https://epns.io/](https://epns.io/)\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nA lot of familiar and famous names \ud83d\udc4f\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\n\ud83d\ude4c\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nCongrats on this achievement \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\n\ud83d\ude03\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nYou have an amazing intro, guys!\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nThank you dear @madamlobster.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nThank you and are you ready to start with the questions from our community?\ud83d\ude00 We want to know more about EPNS\ud83d\ude80\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nSure! let\u2019s do this.\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nQ1 from Telegram user @jobel4  \\nAs the trademark or tagline of EPNS goes \u201d Subscribe, notify and earn.\u201d. Firstly, is the subscription of EPNS is free or need to pay? If need to pay, what is the medium of payment? Can I also unsubscribe? Secondly, How can I get notified, is that thru email, SMS or multimedia messaging? Lastly, as a curiosity how can I earn in your platform if the service you have is giving notification? Thank you.\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nAwesome question!\\n\\nEPNS is free or needs to pay?  \\nSubscribing is a one-time process that is always free!! with the exception of users paying gas for opt-in, which can in many instances be taken care of by services frontend (or through us) via meta transaction.\\n\\nWhen it comes to users, all they have to do is pay the gas fees which can vary depending on if it\u2019s done through L1 or L2. The medium of payment is only in relation to gas and hence ETH. For unsubscribe, A communication protocol needs to have users in full control and hence the user can always unsubscribe with the service having no control over it.\\n\\nHow do you get notified?  \\nSince we abstracted sending notification and receiving part, in essence, notifications can be delivered to any platform including the ones you mentioned! But for now, we want to focus on pseudo-anonymous web3 notifications which mean you are notified on your wallet address. The design is simple, subscribe to a service you want to receive notifications from, connect your public wallet address to either our mobile app, dApp, or extension (coming soon) and that\u2019s it! Let the notifs will come to you.\\n\\nIn the future, we envision EPNS protocol to also be integrated among your favorite crypto wallets which will mean that whatever web3 entry software you use will show these notifs to you!\\n\\nThe Earn part is our favorite! Since we are a decentralized notification protocol, the services before they can send out notifs to their subscribers are required to activate themselves, which we call it creating a channel. For this, they are required to stake DAI (50 or higher) to the protocol. This DAI is then lending out via the protocol to AAVE and in turn, starts generating interest which is distributed among the subscribers of that channel in a weighted manner towards early subscribers.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nDo you have guides on how to use your services?\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nCan we already use your service? on which platforms it\u2019s available?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nSure, we are coming out with our How-to-Guide soon. For now, users can reach us on our telegram group [https://t.me/epnsproject](https://t.me/epnsproject) and we can guide them on each step on how to set it up \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\n\\\\[In reply to Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first\\\\]  \\nGreat! I already downloaded your app, but I think I will need help\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes, While we are on Ropsten, notifications are live and working.\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nHaha, sure! Here to help.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\n\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nNice! I need to try this \ud83d\udc4c\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nThank you for your answers! ready for the next question?\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nWe need to try\ud83d\ude09 sure, it will be very useful!\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes.\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\n**\ud83d\udcaf\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:  \\n**Awesome! Let\u2019s do this!\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nQ2 from Telegram user @Highpee  \\nNotification providers can become annoying sometimes with the way and rate at which they send unsolicited spam notification to users. As a Push Notification Service, how does EPNS ensures that notifications are not unnecessary overbearing but are specifically targetted to add value to the user? Do you have a content filtering and abstraction mechanism within your Protocol to filter unhealthy notifications from service channels and throttle-limit channels with poor spam health score? Our users also able to control spam-related content?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nHahaha, yeah we understand the problem users face when it comes to unsolicited and spam notifications \ud83d\ude05. We actually thought a ton about it and there are a couple of ways by which we mitigate the issue (everything happens on protocol :)):\\n\\n1. Users have to opt in to receive notifications from the service first before they can start communicating. This ensures that users are always in control, if they unsubscribe, there is no way for a service to add to them.\\n\\n2. To ensure that a service doesn\u2019t turn malicious later on, we attach a Spam Score to them as well which is adjusted by both positive (higher number of subscribers, the passage of time, etc) and negative (unusual number of notifications, a higher number of unsubscribes, etc) actions. This score when it crosses a certain threshold activates the protocol throttle mechanism which is a way to penalize services a bit at first and if they don\u2019t stop then making the throttling go high thereby ensuring that it\u2019s always in the best interest of services to not spam their users.\\n\\nWe are also planning verified badges in the future to ensure that while everyone can create a channel and everyone can opt-in, there is a distinction between spammy channels and verified ones.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nSo, users can control this by subscribing and unsubscribing \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes, the user is in control \ud83d\udcaa\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nDid you already notice spammers on your services? Or they didn\u2019t try?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nLol, they are definitely trying more on staging for now \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nThey also in beta \ud83d\ude02\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\n\ud83d\ude05\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nThank you! I am sure you won\u2019t give them any chances \ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nReady for the next question?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes, please.\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nQ3 from Telegram user @AmirJosh  \\nDevice token is a unique key for the app-device combination which is issued by the Apple or Google push notification gateways. Can you please explain further what is Device Tokens importance and functions needed to be able to make it compatible or work efficiently with EPNS App?\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nSeems like someone really is into push! The Apple (and google) push notification gateway also works on the concept of a middleware handling all the notifications from every app and ensuring that the user has opted in for it. In apple\u2019s case, it\u2019s called APNs (Apple Push Notification Service) which is why we choose EPNS (Ethereum Push Notification Service).\\n\\nTo answer this in TLDR \u2192 For Receiving Decentralized Notifications: Each platform has its rules in engaging push notifications. The way EPNS works is that it standardizes the communication layer and the payload emitted out (whether encrypted or plain) which is then read by our infrastructure (or other infra) nodes who can then compose the notification payload out and push it out to the app (essentially decentralized to centralized carrier delivery).\\n\\nWhile we are planning for the nodes will be p2p in the future and will allow wss connections, the receiving part for specific apps logic is left onto them. For us or anyone who wants to push them out to iOS or Android (for example our app or other third-party apps who wants in) will need to enter their creds in the node which is not shared and need to have our SDK in their app. The SDK essentially will be responsible for connecting device tokens to wallet addresses and the rest of the thing is already taken care of by our protocol!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nGreat system!\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nWill you use your own token in this system? If so, when and how people can obtain it?\u263a\ufe0f\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nYes, we do have our governance token $PUSH that will enable users to govern the protocol, handle game theory between all our participants, and\u2026 \ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41have reward/pool sharing built into it so every player wins!!\\n\\nWe will also have liquidity/usage mining that will reward participants among several other use cases.\\n\\nThey are incoming and not yet out\u2026 we will have an announcement on it pretty soon \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\ngreat! \ud83d\udc4d we will be waiting for an announcement then \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\n\ud83e\udd1d\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nCool, stay tuned Satoshiclubbers \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:  \\n**Ready to proceed?\ud83d\ude00\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes, please.\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nThank you for the great answers!\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:  \\n**Q4 from Telegram user @K2ice  \\nIf am right, the current focus of EPNS now is sending notifications directly to user wallets. Are there plans to include Telegram, Twitter, and other platforms in the nearest future?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYou are 100% right! This is where EPNS is really flexible, we are platform agnostic so in the future, we can deliver notifs to telegram, Twitter, or to any other platform as well!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nDo you see user\u2019s demand in this?\ud83d\ude00\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nWe do see some users wanting it, but most want it pseudonym, exactly like their wallet address without any identity connection..like the rest of the Web3 which is why we are first focusing on wallet addresses.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nOh, understand \ud83d\ude02\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nBtw, which notification services do you see as your competitors?\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nWe are the first one to do this so no direct competitors ;). Some indirect ones do it differently in which they monitor a few smart contract and events and ask users to log in to their centralized platforms and create hooks which in essence only adds to the problem as a) they pick and choose smart contracts and b) how can the user be expected of keeping track of all notifs (imagine if every time you installed Telegram, you had to go somewhere, register and add hooks to receive emails), now try it with 50+ services. While these indirect competitors have created awesome tech, we feel that the middleware which we are creating in essence enables this to be done smoother and see them as our future partners \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nYes, you\u2019re right! Better become partners\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nReady to jump to the next question?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes.\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nQ5 from Telegram user @Antoni_azx  \\nThere\u2019s a medium article called \u201cBuilding the cities of the future with EPNS\u201d, It\u2019s about a fictional city and its citizens that interact with various processes and gives an idea of how EPNS could eventually impact our lives, will this all stay fictional? How are you planning to get these features in real life?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nThanks for going through the post! Hope you loved the vision! Any tech which we use at the moment was fictional at one point in time ;). Jetsons and facetime, anyone?\\n\\nWe imagine facetime to become decentralized, DeFi to have mass adoption, Governance of projects done by several users, gaming characters to be truly unique, your mails, and data staying with you among countless other things.\\n\\nAll of this requires communication and services to come to users when their attention is required. Like how TG is sending us notifications of users joining our channels from your awesome Satoshi Club which is of importance to us :). This experience of Web2.0 is needed to enable adoption for Web3.0.\\n\\nFor example, when you take a loan from a bank before it\u2019s liquidated, you are sent several alerts from your bank. The same or any type of alert is not present in Web3.0 and it creates blockers for innovation that we see to be 10x better than web2 yet still have user engagement and experience issues.\\n\\nAll of this led us to research and create a protocol that is infinitely extensible to not only handle notifs that are text but can also handle any type of payload (which in essence is what APNs do as well). This enables us to send even right now notifs that can carry CTA, Youtube Videos, Encrypted Transactions, or anything else that is imaginable.\\n\\nIn essence, we have already created that standard which is content independent (allowing usage for any service imaginable), storage independent (support IPFS, smart contract, and any other storage standard that comes out), supports encryption (to support chats, video calls, MFA, etc) and delivery independent (platform and in future blockchain agnostic).\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nWhat is your nearest goal now? And which goal is the most important?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nAudit and Mainnet \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nYou are building a very useful service in people\u2019s lives, to be honest\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nOh, I see\ud83d\ude02 do you already started with audit?\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nGolden words \ud83d\udc4f\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\n\ud83d\udc96\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nWe are talking with various firms and trying to see which one works best!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\n\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nNice approach! thank you for answers! ready for the last question from part 1?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nSure!\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:  \\n**Q6 from Telegram user @Indomiekuy  \\nI read your telegram that EPNS already has a partnership with Aave and Matic Network, as I know Matic is a layer2 scaling solution and Aave is Defi protocol focus for deposit and borrowing. What is the result of EPNS with Aave and Matic from work together? Do you have a plan for other partnerships in the future?\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\n**Thanks for going through them! Both of them are extremely important to us. Fun fact: When we first started building PoC, Stani was the one who told us we would love to personally use this service and when Stani says that he would want something, you have to go and build it out ;).\\n\\nAAVE is used by us to generate interest and of course, we love them a ton! Matic is our goto solution for L2, both for making sure, notifs are delivered faster, become cheaper for services, and also to scale the solution to match web2 standards!\\n\\nWe are always on the lookout for great partnerships and synergies! Heavy believers of win-win game theory \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nYes, Matic is becoming one of the leaders of l2 solutions!\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nYes, they\u2019re awesome!\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nWill we hear about some new partnerships soon?\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nMaybe you can give us some hints already? \ud83d\ude04\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nWe are told by our advisors to be \ud83e\udd2b about this! but many more coming soon!\\n\\n**D. | Satoshi Club:**  \\nGot it \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nOhhhh\ud83d\ude02 those advisors\ud83d\ude02\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nBut I understand.\\n\\n**Mary | Satoshi Club:**  \\nWe will wait for news from EPNS!\\n\\n**Part 2 \u2014 live questions from the Telegram community**\\n\\n**_Q1 from Telegram user @Pro Trader_**\\n\\n**Do you have any plans to earn money from ads?**\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nThat\u2019s a really cool use case, and yes we will be exploring the possibilities, and yes we have something in the future pipeline but which would again be user opt-in.\\n\\n**_Q2 from Telegram user @Memo_**\\n\\n**I understand that EPNS is only responsible for sending the notification, no matter what its content is, but is this really not dangerous for you? In case they are inappropriate content, could you not be accused or prosecuted for being an accomplice publishing it?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nYes, we thought about this a ton! Innovation often can be misused and in the end, we tried to tackle this by ensuring governance takes care of removing the channel if it used for a nefarious purpose. Also, open to awesome ideas as this is ever-growing and evolving protocol.\\n\\n**_Q3 from Telegram user @Luis_**  \\n\u26d4\ufe0f **Only services can decide what to communicate to their users. Are these services exclusively focused on user preferences, or can any non-wanted service be spammed all the same?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nUser preference is a future feature which ensures that user even can conditionalize it from there end. if a service spams after a while then spam throttle index of protocol will ensure that they are penalized by throlling notifications via a quadratic formula.\\n\\n**_Q4 from Telegram user @Jade_**\\n\\n\u2705 **EPNS says that is the missing piece that needs the WEB3, so apart of its desktop version, EPNS can be integrated to wallets like Metamask or Trustwallet?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nYes! That\u2019s exactly what our vision is. To have any wallets give you the notifs you opted in for!\\n\\n**_Q5 from Telegram user @o0s$a4l_**\\n\\n**I have not seen $PUSH listed on any exchange or had a pre-sale, in what form will it launch its token?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nWe will be releasing awesome details soon! But yes, we are going to launch with public sale, loads of gratitude and with some really awesome perks that we will announe soon!\\n\\nImportant: Please beware of scams. The token contract address will only be published in the official EPNS Telegram [https://t.me/epnsproject](https://t.me/epnsproject) group and other official channels. When in doubt, please reach out to us on telegram or through other official means on the [https://epns.io/.](https://epns.io/.)\\n\\n**_Q6 from Telegram user @Dr Araceley_**\\n\\n**I\u2019m a creative developer who loves working on cool tech, and would love to work with EPNS, how do I reach out?**\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nThank you for being so awesome and willing to contribute to EPNS. Please join us on telegram [https://t.me/epnsproject](https://t.me/epnsproject) or if you want to deep dive into tech join our discord [https://discord.gg/UUdjemmQbc](https://discord.gg/UUdjemmQbc)\\n\\n**_Q7from Telegram user @Femi Oyinloye_**\\n\\n**During the start up of your project, what are the technical difficulties you faced and how did you overcome them?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nAny start up will have several things that will require attention and honestly, we are grateful that the awesome Ethereum community handled it for us. We recommend askign for help whenever you start something, you can\u2019t do everything yourself but you have so many awesome people who would love to help, guide and grow you if you just ask. Once we started doing this, these tech difficulties went away!\\n\\n**_Q8 from Telegram user @Robocop_**\\n\\n**After learning about EPNS project, in my opinion, there will be many people who won\u2019t become part of EPNS network and community, how could we as a community get involved? Do you have any bounty or maybe airdrop program that ongoing for now?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nAwesome! We wouldn\u2019t want it any other way! We love our community and to get involved, just start poking around, either in development, marketing or anything in between. We love suggestions on any and everything and honestly, some of the coolest features of the tech and some of the awesome campaigns are ideas our community told us!\\n\\nWe can\u2019t share any plans about bounty or airdrop except that we are grateful to our community support and this won\u2019t just remain on paper \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n**_Q9 from Telegram user @Jesus Freites_**\\n\\n**EPNS uses a loan to AAVE to generate interest that is distributed among the subscribers of the service. Percentage-wise, how high is this interest? Are there other incentive protocols that you will employ to entice more users to use EPNS PUSH notifications?**\\n\\n**Harsh | EPNS:**  \\nSince generated interest as well as the stake of channel defines incentives (and opens up possibility of incentivized promotion for them), it becomes tricky to answer it. The user passive income depends on what channels they have subscribed and what those channels have offered. Pro tip: this is a passive income so subscribe to notifications you want which will make the experience of Web3 better :).\\n\\nWe will be having other incentive protocols in the future and there is going to be rewarded for active user participation as well \ud83c\udf89 Stay tuned for a very detailed reward of EPNS guide which will come out very soon!\\n\\n**_Q10 from Telegram user @Roger Grass_**\\n\\n**Can EPNS be in the BSC or Tron network rather than eth where the gas fee is getting higher?**\\n\\n**Richa | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:**  \\nSure! While we have Ethereum in the name, we actually are blockchain agnostic! It\u2019s just that we would want to tackle the problem of DeFi first hence EPNS and why we are on Ethereum first! That, and besides the awesome support we have gotten from the community means that we have to solve this for them first and then get it to others \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n# Part 3 \u2014 Quiz Results\\n\\nAs usual, for the third part, Satoshi Club Team asked the chat 4 questions about the crypto project.

With technology being experimented with in multiple different ways, industries try to figure out the killer use case for such a novel concept of decentralization that wasn\u2019t really seen before the release of Bitcoin in 2009. Although public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have had a rise in popularity since 2017, blockchain technology is not limited to cryptocurrency and nor is it limited to a public blockchain. Most industries nowadays are looking at ways to implement private blockchains to improve throughput, privacy, and security, all the while maintaining the decentralized aspect of it (relatively).\\n\\nTwo major industries that are rigorously researching and making immense strides in the use of blockchain technology as we speak are Healthcare and Insurance.\\n\\nLet us take a quick dive into the lives of people at Blockville, a fictional city, by exploring how the fictional citizens of Blockville interact with various processes in their beloved city, we would get a good idea of how blockchain and EPNS could eventually impact our lives and that too from a user perspective (without getting into the nitty-gritty technical jargon).\\n\\n# **The curious case of Blockville**\\n\\nBlockville, the city of the future. While people from the past envisioned flying cars in the future, that is not quite the case yet. Blockville \u2014 the world\u2019s first blockchain-powered city, the first completely decentralized city, is what they call it. Every system and process is decentralized, from the fleet of autonomous vehicles, to even the election of the government! All with help of the primary infrastructure of communication that they proudly use, EPNS! Your electric vehicle is low on charge? Get notified, and you get to decide whether to redirect to the closest charging station or take your chance and get back home where you already have one set up. Major news to be announced by media and news outlets? EPNS delivers it right to the fingertips of Blockville citizens, and the best part about all of this? Blockville citizens not only receive notifications but earn passive income from these notifications targeted at them. Are elections going on? Use EPNS to signal or vote using on-chain governance voting and even get the chance to predict the outcome of these city mayoral elections with the help of decentralized prediction markets!\\n\\nWithin this fantastic and revolutionary city, there are multiple citizens going about their daily lives. Let\u2019s meet John. John is in his apartment that is tokenized in his name, he seems to be in quite a fuss, trying to stuff his bags at the last moment as he is way behind schedule to leave for the airport to meet his family back home for the holidays.\\n\\nIt\u2019s a hustle and bustle as John packs his bags.\\n\\nAir travel has come back strong and traveling is no longer feared like it was during the pandemic. COVID is now history, a story to tell your kids like how John\u2019s great grandfather used to talk about his time at the World War.\\n\\n5 hours before departure, John swings his luggage into the car to make it in time at the check-in as he has a commute of about 3 hours before reaching the airport. On his way, he notices the sky to be quite cloudy and it looks like there is going to be a heavy downpour soon. As he makes way into the airport, John receives an EPNS notification that the flight is canceled due to unpredictable weather conditions. Disappointed, John begins to head to the information desk to know what to do next. But soon he starts receiving EPNS notifications from the Airline he booked his flight with. It mentioned that the next flight to his destination is 8 hours away and that he is more than welcome to avail the complimentary lounge accommodation that the airline was willing to give to all passengers who missed the flight, and his insurance company had also notified him that some of the money which he had used to buy his ticket will be reimbursed to his wallet. John had fortunately signed up for the flight insurance package when he booked his tickets online hence, he was eligible to avail these benefits. John is relieved, and the notifications that were sent to him created no room for any doubt as he was able to now plan how to handle the crisis. John remembered that all airline operations and insurance operations are run on a blockchain and hence the use of EPNS notifications has automated and simplified the communication process which used to be a pressing concern for mainstream adoption, but not anymore.\\n\\nJohn reaches his insured room and takes some rest. He looks at his phone and sees a notification from his insurance company, **_\u201cCHA-CHING!!! You just received a reimbursement deposit in your wallet on behalf of your insurance company\u201d._**\\n\\nHe receives yet another notification a few hours later to confirm his next flight and upon confirmation, he receives a QR code to his ticket via notification, and finally, things look good for John. Blockville\u2019s commitment to blockchain and EPNS has made life easier for John, and this is why he loves this city, it gives power back to the people.\\n\\nLet\u2019s now zoom out from John and now focus on another loyal citizen of Blockville \u2014 Kevin. Kevin is in his mid-50s, and has not been feeling too well these days, he fears that he must have contracted something and wants to visit a doctor. But he is currently in another part of the city where he is visiting his son for the upcoming holidays and is away from his home. But it\u2019s okay since all Hospitals and Healthcare centers in Blockville are in a consortium and are connected to the blockchain, he can use a dApp to schedule his appointment with a doctor in the nearest hospital and use his SSI (Self Sovereign Identity). As his appointment is confirmed, Kevin gets notified about it directly in his wallet and he receives a \u201crequest of transfer\u201d of his EHR (Electronic Health Records) from the Hospital he booked an appointment with via EPNS, which he approves by signing it with his SSI credentials and approves the doctor who he is meeting with to have access to his medical history and prescriptions. He takes this moment to even acknowledge the simplicity and need for such use-cases of Health Records with blockchain. He remembers reading that before Blockville\u2019s EHR blockchain innovation statistics showed that up to 1 in 5 patient records are not accurately matched even within the same health care system. As many as half of the patient records are mismatched when data is transferred between healthcare systems. He relishes and appreciates how far technology has improved especially in Blockville, no wonder he loves staying here. As Kevin is taken aback by all these thoughts, he loses track of time. An hour before his appointment is due, Kevin receives an automated decentralized notification to remind him about the booking and so he gets ready to leave for the hospital.\\n\\nAs Kevin reaches the hospital on time (thanks to the reminder), he meets the doctor who asks him a few questions and then asks him to run some tests. Upon testing, the reports are sent to the doctor, which are then added to Kevin\u2019s EHR, and Kevin is notified about this. He meets the doctor again who prescribes him some medicines and drugs to be taken in a timely manner, and informs him about his condition, Kevin doesn;t have much to worry about, just a few days of antibiotics will do the trick for him and it isn\u2019t that serious. The news was a relief to Kevin as he presumed something bad had happened to him. The doctor updates Kevin\u2019s EHR and pushes it back into the blockchain, all the information is encrypted (even the notifications) so Kevin doesn\u2019t have to worry about his privacy. As the information is updated Kevin receives his timely updates on notifications.\\n\\nKevin now goes to the hospital\u2019s pharmacy to collect his medication. The pharmacist looks for the prescription order sent by the doctor via the Pharmacy Channel in EPNS. He then scans Kevin\u2019s credentials to verify that he is giving the medications to the right person and offers Kevin to opt-in for alerts to make sure he takes the medication on time, to which Kevin agrees.\\n\\nKevin takes his drugs and is about to leave but he remembers something important. He remembers the issue of fake and fraudulent drugs in the pharmaceutical supply chain and thankfully, Blockville has a tracking mechanism in place for all the drugs in all their pharmacies, this allows anyone to check the date of manufacturing, expiry date, where it was manufactured and most of all it was verified by the supply chain blockchain, which gave more trust to Kevin. Once he buys the medication, Kevin set up reminders to remind him to take his medications on time as suggested by the pharmacist.\\n\\nAs he left the hospital, Kevin receives another notification, this time from his insurance company which has verified his visit and has insured his complete visit to the hospital.\\n\\nKevin heads back to where his son stays, and can now peacefully enjoy his holidays and take his medications at the right time as well!\\n\\nThese were just a few daily use-cases for the citizens of Blockville. With a city powered by blockchain, there is more to be explored. With the use of EPNS, the use of blockchain and Web3 has just been made easier, even for big industries like Healthcare and Insurance. The possibilities for EPNS are endless!\\n\\n# About Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)\\n\\nEPNS is a decentralized notification protocol that enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications. Using the protocol, any dApp, service or smart contract can send notifications to users in a platform-agnostic fashion (mobile, tablet, web, user wallets, etc).\\n\\nStay in touch with Push!

Despite the onset of the pandemic, we saw the crypto world booming, as DeFi started to explode and blockchain saw innovation at its height!\\n\\nIt is humbling to rewind over the past year and take a look back at what we have been able to achieve. From ideation to creation, and the alpha launch of EPNS protocol and products on Ropsten\u2026 it has been a awesome year so far, and we look forward to growing into greater heights in the year to come and are ever so grateful for the opportunities given.\\n\\nWe think the biggest credit goes to the love, support and backing of our AWESOME community! Though I also think equal credit belongs to the team ..for the efforts they did to enable coordinated remote work and timings; for adjusting their schedules and their timezones; for achieving a collaborative, conducive and fulfilling team environment, which when put together enabled us to achieve the vision of making EPNS what it is today!\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\\n\\nWelcome to the EPNS 2020 Rewind! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 where we summarize the major highlights of the year and go through loads of awesome nostalgic vibes!\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1f**Reaching for the Stars \u2014 Our Journey**\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\n2020 marked the birth of EPNS. Since the ideation of EPNS back in January, it took us a couple of months to bring the idea to Ethereum Foundation who guided us to ETHGlobal HackMoney where we hacked and #buidl EPNS protocol and product MVP. With awesome guidance and mentorship from the folks at ETHGlobal team, AAVE, etc. the idea was refined, vetted, and validated thoroughly.\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{borderRadius: \'32px\'}} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwwnlmUpRsk\\" title=\\"Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</VideoContainer>\\n\\n<ImageText>How it started \ud83d\udc96</ImageText>\\n\\nWe didn\u2019t even realized at that point of the massive support which was incoming from the community and our awesome mentors! Shortly after the hackathon, we were shortlisted by IDEO Collab (30 top DeFi projects from 120+) and were mentored during IDEO PVD (Product Validation Day) to synthesize user feedback and validate the idea. \u2b50\ufe0f\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/IDEOVC/status/1273639750918782977&amp;image=\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"637\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"\\" class=\\"eo n ff dy bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\nThis was shortly followed by getting accepted into the first cohort of Gitcoin KERNEL \ud83c\udf31 from which we graduated as top 20 finalists! We \u2764\ufe0f \ud83c\udf31 Forever!\\n\\n![First Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nGitcoin Demo Day!!\\n\\nAlso, around this time, we got awarded grants from Matic and AAVE which motivated and encouraged us to shoot for the stars \ud83c\udf20. Digressing from the journey a bit, we just want to highlight how awesome ecosystems requires superheros \ud83e\uddb8 who support innovation and Open Source Software (#OSS) projects through Grants! We really can\u2019t thank them enough for all the support extended to all the projects because of them!\\n\\nSpeaking about #OSS, how can we forget the awesomeness Gitcoin has created for all of us through their grants round where community love and support is directly transformed into the quadratic funding for anyone\u2019s next super cool idea!\\n\\nThis was also incidentally the next milestone of the journey and we were blown away by the validation and love the community gave us in [Gitcoin Grants (CLR7)](https://gitcoin.co/grants/936/ethereum-push-notification-service-epns) where we were one of the Top 5 projects by the number of contributors (over 250) \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude4f\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nThanks to all the amazing people who donated to our Gitcoin grant and all our well wishers\\n\\nLater, EPNS also got selected for the CoinList Seed Fall 2020 Batch and they still help us to this very day with whatever things we want to learn about, not to mention that some of the investors of our seed round came in because of them selecting us in their prestigious batch \u2764\ufe0f!\\n\\nThrough out the journey, the thing that stuck out to us was how everyone helped us to grow and supported us at every step\u2026 which became our mantra and we would tell everyone who becomes able in the space to do \ud83d\udc47\\n\\n> \u2b50\ufe0f Pay it forward\u2026 \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f!\\n\\nIn the same spirit, we returned back in Gitcoin #GR8 Round, not as grant participant but this time to proudly support the #GR8 Hackathon, we put forward some bounties for the hackathon and happy to share that all of them are coming back to EPNS ecosystem in the form of amazing features developed by awesome developers!\\n\\nApart from all the grants, accelerators, and hackathons, we were also fortunate and grateful for all the peeps that joined our advisory board, they help, guide and steer us in the right direction almost on a daily basis \ud83d\ude80 and we can\u2019t be here without them.\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-3.webp)\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1f**Our Backbone \u2014 The Tech/Protocol**\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nEPNS aims to significantly improve the Web3 infrastructure by providing a critical yet, a missing piece in Web3 that directly correlates to User Experience \u2014 a decentralized communication middleware for Web3 services to send notifications to users wallets.\\n\\nYear 2020 saw the release of our EPNS Protocol on [Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xb02E99b9634bD21A8e3E36cc7adb673287A8FeaC#writeProxyContract) that paved the way for the first time for decentralzied notifications to operate! This was shortly followed with **_\u201cnotification receiving\u201d_** platforms that enabled users to experience these notification just by signing through their wallet address.\\n\\nThese included alpha versions of the EPNS [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/ethereum-push-service-epns/id1528614910) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.epns.epns) app as well as EPNS [dApp](https://apps.apple.com/app/ethereum-push-service-epns/id1528614910). Of course the vision is to have EPNS protocol integrated across all user wallets for a seamless notification experience.\\n\\nWe also published the EPNS [Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io/) (and [Litepaper](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ethereum-push-notification-service-litepaper-e7ca0a662862)) earlier this year.\\n\\nWe also have been building some cool channels that can deliver much needed notifications to the users. So far we have deployed the following channels on our dApp (check them out at [https://app.epns.io)](https://app.epns.io).) with more coming soon! Team favorites channels are ETHGas, ENS Domain Expiry, ETH Tracker and BanklessFR so far!\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-4.gif)\\n\\nOur vision of being a **Web3 Standard for Notification** is tightly coupled with a feature packed roadmap, we are working on it and still have few things to add (colored post-it are different cogs of the ecosystem), having said that, here\u2019s a sneak peek \ud83d\udc40\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020. A Rewind On All Things EPNS!!](./image-5.webp)\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1f**Seed Announcement**\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nThe awesome journey and folks enabled us to raise our seed round which got announced during the start of December! We were able to successfully raised $750k at a valuation of $5 million. **$PUSH for the win!\\\\*\\\\* More than the raise! we are humbled and grateful for the support of Web3 Leaders and notable VCs who backed our vision of decentralized notifications and are our long term partners!\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020.

This year was packed with lots of amazing virtual events and talks that we were thrilled to be a part of.\\n\\nHere is a quick round-up of some of the many events we had been a part of in 2020.\\n\\n## **Ask Me Anything:**\\n\\n- EPNS AMA with Matic\\n- EPNS AMA with Bundle Africa\\n- EPNS AMA with AMA Lovers Club\\n\\n## **Conferences and Workshops:**\\n\\n- 2.5 Talk Show at ETHBerlin\\n- ETHCon Korea\\n- Gitcoin: Welcome to Web3\\n- EDCON 2020\\n- BlockHash LIVE 2020\\n- Chainlink Hackathon Workshop\\n- Gitcoin Grants #GR8 Hackathon Workshop\\n- Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) Asia Pacific 2020\\n- ETHIndia Mentorship session\\n\\n![Image of It\u2019s A Wrap For 2020.

We are very grateful to all the organizers and sponsors for giving us the opportunity\\n\\nThere is nothing better than speaking to the community and educating everyone about the possibilities of DeFi, Game Theory, and Decentralized Notifications and then answering their questions and queries. We loved every second of talking to you all, and we hope to speak with the community at large more in the year to come.\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf1f**EPNS Featured!**\ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nEPNS was proud to be featured in a number of articles, newsletters, and other publications.

We are deeply humbled and grateful for the support from our investors. Most of them are already our mentors and provide invaluable guidance, networking and deep practical knowledge of the ecosystem.\\n\\n# Genesis of \u201cMissing Piece of Web3 Infrastructure\u201d\\n\\nPrevious technology often follows a pattern which can be observed to find ways to address the pain points in upcoming technology. As Mark Twain puts it, History doesn\u2019t repeat itself but often rhymes. We can learn a great deal from observing and, of course, being at the right place at the right time.\\n\\nThe genesis of the idea for EPNS occurred when we sat down to observe what, if any, pain points still existed among blockchain apps (dApps / smart contracts / services) that we could solve. We were quick to realize that something felt a bit odd, but took some time to realize that Web3 tech behaved a lot like the early days of the internet.\\n\\nThink 2004ish when GMail was launched and changed inboxes forever. At that point of time, the internet was still growing and the services offered behaved exactly the same way they do in Web3 today. For instance, you as a user were expected to log in to your mailbox to check email, reply to friends / work and then come back to it later and rinse and repeat. If you were the trendy one back in those days then maybe you went to Myspace and Orkut as well! But no matter the service, you were always going back to check on your actions.\\n\\n[This drastically changed when Apple came up with notifications in 2010](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/in-2009-push-notifications-changed-web2-0-in-2020-epns-is-bringing-them-to-web3-0-4ac506a0c9de) (though Google might have invented them). All of a sudden, services began to reach out to users whenever an action was required from their end. It increased engagement rate 7x and massively improved user experience. Notifications have been so engraved into our lives now that we hardly realize most of our online actions are caused by them; think about it, whatsapp, facetime, emails, payments, games all inform you now. You don\u2019t go back to them to see if something has happened.\\n\\nContrast this experience with any dApps, smart contracts or services you interact with on Web3. There\u2019s no way to inform users (wallet addresses) any time an important event occurs. Instead, the user is assumed to go back to the service time and time again to check their activity.\\n\\nFor instance, Liquidation on AAVE, Compound or any DeFi, DAO Governance proposal (Yam!), or ENS / dEx orders. Each of these are a reality right now but no solution exists to address them and the problem will only worsen as more services come to Web3.\\n\\nThis was the moment that we realized that this stone age era of communication in blockchain needs to go. You are not foreclosed by your bank without proper notices that reach you, but DeFi \u2014 while enabling awesome use cases \u2014 does that to you. And we wanted to fix that.\\n\\n# Our Vision\\n\\nWeb3 users are wallet addresses and Web3 services are serverless. The entry point to any dApp starts with connecting your crypto wallet and thus it makes sense to enable notifications to wallets as that is at the core of the entire Web3 experience.\\n\\nWe envision a world of Web2 where notifications are delivered to whatever platform the user is using and can come from any blockchain apps that want to notify. The wallet should be able to earn part of the revenue as well, as they essentially are a part of the notifications experience and everything needs to be decentralized to ensure that things happen in a transparent, platform agnostic and of course DeFi incentivized way. And perhaps most importantly, users need to have complete control to ensure they are not inundated with unwanted, unhelpful, or overwhelming notifications.\\n\\nThe very next steps will be to build some of the remaining features of the protocol MVP and move towards audit and then come on Mainnet!\\n\\n# EPNS Advisors\\n\\nWe are really grateful for the guidance and support (not to mention the love) we have been given by our Advisors and we wouldn\'t have been here without them.

Using the protocol, any dApp, smart contract or service can send notifications to users(wallet addresses) in a platform agnostic fashion (mobile, web, or user wallets). The DeFi aspect of the protocol also ensures that the user receives and earns from those notifications.\\n\\nStay in touch with Push!

The product release was met with small applause but signaled the first example of an innovation that would fundamentally transform Web2 and the Internet: **push notifications**.\\n\\nFor 6 years, nothing notable happened in the narrowly-defined world of push notifications. Then, in June 2009, Apple released iOS 3.0, which introduced [APNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service) (Apple Push Notifications Service), a protocol that would grow to revolutionize digital communication. APNS was introduced at a time when the Internet was still young; a time when Gmail was just launched, when Orkut and Myspace were a thing (time flies, huh?).\\n\\nApple took the notification idea Blackberry introduced in 2003 and evolved it into a product that would become a mainstream product expectation among consumers and would change Web2 to become the thing we know it to be today.\\n\\nApple did what they do best \u2014 found a way to incentivize continuous consumer use of its products. Before APNS was introduced, an application was effectively closed and out of sight if it was not being actively used. APNS enabled publishers and services to entice users to re-launch their apps by sending them short, optimized messages. With that opportunity available to apps, we saw entire ecosystems, business models, job titles, and revenue streams spring into existence.\\n\\n# Push Notifications\\n\\nPush notifications are now so engraved into our daily mobile experience that it\u2019s difficult to exactly remember our digital experience a decade ago when the feature was nearly non-existent. We rely on them so much that we don\u2019t necessarily recognize their intrinsic value. At best, we take notifications for granted. At worst, we consider them a nuisance. Rarely do we remember how fundamentally they have changed our digital behavior and relationship with businesses.\\n\\n> _The main advantage of push notifications over in-app messages is the ability to draw the user back into the app after they\u2019ve exited, unlike in-app notifications that require a user to be actively using an app to see them._\\n\\nPush notifications allowed businesses to step up their marketing game, increased CTR, and even led to an increase in customer retention. Push notifications have evolved so much in the marketing space and in our technological culture in the past 10 years that now, if you do not send notifications to your clients, then you\u2019ve essentially lost a large amount of potential returning customers. What we have seen is the fundamental reorganization and enrichment of consumer and application behavior and relationship in the face of push notifications.\\n\\nNext up was to replicate the impact of push notifications on Web2 onto Web3 while improving the impact by adhering to the principles of decentralization, user ownership, and incentivization.\\n\\n# The flawed user experience in Web 3.0\\n\\nDecentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain technology is leading the way for Web3.0 but currently suffers from the subpar user experience.\\n\\nCurrently, there is no notification system that allows services to communicate with their consumers in real-time! With all the development going on in Web3.0, such an integral component to user experience has been overlooked for such a long time. The lack of a well-defined user experience in Web3.0 delays mainstream adoption, especially with everyone cozy and comfortable in their centralized Web2.0 bubbles.\\n\\nUsers are so used to push notifications and the value it provides in Web2.0 that services nowadays no longer expect users to come and check for an action item or an event, instead, the services come to you _(imagine if Amazon didn\u2019t notify you that your product is about to be delivered and you had to check time and time again to know the status of your delivery_).\\n\\nA few examples of the flawed user experience we have in Web 3.0 right now:\\n\\n- You just traded on a DEX (Decentralized Exchange), but want to know if it went through? Looks like you\u2019ve got to go back and check. **_No Notifications for You!_**\\n- Have a registered domain on a blockchain (example ENS), and want to be alerted when it is time for renewal? Too bad, schedule a reminder on your calendar and keep your fingers crossed. **_No Notifications for You!_**\\n- Are you providing a Web3.0 service and want to update your users on critical governance voting to help save your compromised protocol? Too bad, post a tweet or a Medium post and hope it reaches the required audience. **_No Notifications for You!_**\\n\\nThis is a huge gap in Web3.0, where users still have to return to apps and services to check on the status of their actions. This isn\u2019t purposeful negligence of user experience; there exists no efficient, decentralized, Web3.0-based protocol for services to deliver notifications to users. Until now.\\n\\n# EPNS Brings UX 2.0 to Web 3.0\\n\\nThis is where [**Ethereum Push Notification Service**](http://epns.io) (EPNS) comes in. EPNS allows services to send decentralized notifications to user wallets. Not only do users receive notifications, but the users also **earn** from **receiving** these notifications. Using the EPNS protocol; any dApp, service, or smart contract can send notifications to users (wallet addresses) in a platform-agnostic way. This is the critical missing piece of blockchain and will revolutionize the Web3.0 space!\\n\\nThe protocol allows users to be in direct control of what services they get notifications from, it imposes rules on the services including spam protection for users, limiting their ability to add wallets as subscribers, etc.\\n\\nWith EPNS, one can bridge the gap between the user expectations that are already established in Web2.0 but lacking in Web3.0, and make it a reality.\\n\\nWith the EPNS Showrunner Channels, you can even see the actual value provided by these notifications first hand!\\n\\n- **Crypto Price Tracker:** Track the price of popular cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH on an hourly basis with the help of the Crypto Price Tracker Channel and stay updated always on the price of your favorite cryptos and avoid liquidation. As they say \u201cone week in Crypto & DeFi is equal to one year in normal time\u201d, and you can keep track of it all right at your fingertips.\\n- **ENS Domain Expiry:** Are you someone who has registered a domain on ENS (Ethereum Name Service)? If yes, then you may find solace that you no longer have to set reminders for yourself to renew your domain name, EPNS does that for you!\\n- **Wallet Crypto Movement Tracker:** Just traded on a DEX or transferred your funds to another account and would like to know if it went through? You might think this is possible now, but you would be astonished that this is not the case! Imagine if you never received a notification from a Traditional Bank when you completed a transaction online, you would be scrambling to check the confirmation of the transaction! What makes Web3 any different? EPNS solves this for you.\\n- **Compound Liquidation Alert:** Invested in DeFi and don\u2019t want to get liquidated overnight? \u201cDon\u2019t worry, EPNS has got you!\u201d. With the Compound Liquidation Showrunner Channel, you will be alerted when your assets are about to be liquidated!\\n\\nThese are just a few Showrunners that the EPNS has been working on to demonstrate the value of using such a revolutionary product.\\n\\nAdditional functionality with EPNS includes alerting token holders about critical Governance Proceedings. For example, what if there is a bug in one of the protocols you use, on protocols with a completely on-chain governance model, you may want to vote to fix it, but with the current medium of communication (example Twitter), there is no room to let your guard down and relax as you may \u2014 in simple words \u2014 miss it! EPNS allows you to stay up to date with the state of the protocols you use and makes sure that whatever information you must know shall and will be presented before you.\\n\\nIn the end, it all boils down to user experience. If Web3 needs to be widely accepted, we can no longer rely on outdated and inefficient methods of communication from service to client. **In other words, we cannot rely on Web2.0 to help run the communication of platforms on Web3.0.** There absolutely must be a clear flow of communication between users and the services running on the Web3.0 infrastructure; and EPNS is that protocol..\\n\\nApple may have changed the world with push notifications, but EPNS aims to decentralize them and return power to the people. And by doing this EPNS can propel Web3.0 to new heights, encourage greater innovations, and improve accessibility as services start to use this platform, just like push notifications were reimagined, revolutionized, and made mainstream by Apple.\\n\\nIn addition to this whole dynamic of enhanced user experience, EPNS also incentivizes you to use the protocol by paying you. Every channel stakes some amount of a stablecoin (such as $DAI) when activating itself as a channel. This stake is added to a staking pool which is then used to generate returns with interest with the integration of DeFi protocols such as AAVE. This interest gained is then distributed back to all the subscribers to that channel by giving a larger share to early subscribers (weighted distribution). And what do you as a consumer have to do? Just subscribe to the channels you want to receive notifications, and then sit back and let the passive income flow. This opens a whole new world of opportunities from the consumer perspective.\\n\\nWith rich text formatting, images, and videos along with your notifications, EPNS changes the very concept of the boring old text-based notification we are all used to and adds some style and flavor to it as well (imagine Twitter, but for notifications).\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nIt\u2019s time for the world to see what decentralization can achieve. EPNS will be one of the key stepping stones for widespread and mainstream adoption of Web3.0 and blockchain technologies.\\n\\nAs the world moves to become decentralized in the coming years, we must try not to lose the functionality and user experience we have developed with the centralized systems over the past decade that our consumers now know and love. EPNS decentralizes Push Notifications in a platform-agnostic way in 2020, something that has never been seen before. History is in the making and you can be a part of it.\\n\\nListen up Web3.0 world, EPNS has got you \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96. Push notifications have come to Web3.0 and they are here to stay!\\n\\nDon\u2019t forget to \ud83c\udf29\u26a1\ud83d\udc49 \ufe0f [FEEL THE THUNDER](https://epns.io/) \ud83d\udc48\u26a1\ud83c\udf29\ufe0f\\n\\nStay in touch with Push!

Hello Richa and Harsh, welcome to the Matic community \ud83d\ude42. Could you please tell us a little about yourself and EPNS?\\n\\n**Answer. Harsh:** Thanks Arun and Awesome Matic team for hosting us. Awesome to be here.\\n\\n**Harsh:** I am Harsh, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service, we are building the world\u2019s first notification protocol. Some background about me, I have over 11 years entrepreneurial experience in various spectrum of tech; including architecting, development and design in different tech fields (Mobile, Web Services, SaaS, Blockchain).\\n\\n**Richa:** Thanks for the invite Arun and Hi All! Awesome to be here. I am co-founder of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS). I wear multiple hats at EPNS though am focused on mostly Marketing and Product. Before EPNS, I worked with companies like Deloitte, Wipro etc. and have close to 12 years of techno-functional experience in various aspects of product management, design and development across multiple facets of the product lifecyle.\\n\\n**About Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)**\\n\\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is a decentralized notification protocol that enables any dApp / smart contract / any service to send notifications to users (wallet addresses).\\n\\nBut that\u2019s not just it, you as a user are always in control, and are able to passively earn from receiving notifications due to the DeFi aspect of the protocol! Other than that, services can send notifications to users(wallet addresses) in a platform agnostic way (mobile, tablet, web, fav. wallets, etc) making us Platform Agnostic \ud83d\ude42\\n\\nEPNS is bringing Web2.0 notification experience to Web3.0 powered by Matic Network for optimization and scalability \ud83d\udcaa\\n\\n> Q2. Sounds really cool! There is a strong focus on rewarding users for using EPNS. EPNS users who are subscribed to channels earn rewards, does this apply to all EPNS users or are there categories of users who earn from EPNS? And where does this reward come from?\\n\\n**Answer. Richa:** Designing the protocol we wanted to have a WIN-WIN \ud83d\ude4c (game theory) for all players involved in the ecosystem. When a user subscribes to a channel, they automatically become eligible for incentives from the channel. Moreover, the rewards are distributed to the users in a weighted manner, example, if Bob subscribes to a channel on Day-1 and Alice subscribes to the channel on Day-20, Bob would be eligible to receive a higher portion of the interest incentives compared to Alice. This also helps reward early adopters (supporters) of the service.\\n\\n_Where does this reward come from?_\\n\\nEPNS protocol requires a service to activate themselves before they can send notifications, this is a one time step and the activation requires deposit a one-time stake fee.\\n\\nThis stake fee is then automatically lend out to AAVE protocol and starts generating interest. This generated interest is then distributed to the subscribers of the channel (service) in a weighted fashion thus making the notifications incentivized for the users \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nBlockchain has been long touted as power to the people and many don\u2019t realize that it is now more possible than ever. While 2017 was about dreaming of having services that pay consumers like video streaming, content writing, etc. 2020 is all about making that possible and we are proud to have made incentivized notifications a possibility and hence contributed a little bit towards web 3.0 \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n> Q3.That\u2019s a great, sustainable model. What are the major milestones EPNS has achieved so far and what are in the future pipeline? How soon can the community expect to use EPNS live on Matic?\\n\\n**Answer. Harsh:** Sure, here comes a long answer \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n_What are the major milestones EPNS has achieved so far and what are in the future pipeline?_\\n\\nWe have been moving quite fast and all credit for this goes to our awesome team which is located across the globe and ensures that the EPNS is moving ahead every minute of the entire day.\\n\\nSome of the major milestones achieved are:\\n\\n\\\\- Proof of Concept\\n\\n\\\\- Enabling incentives for users on protocol\\n\\n\\\\- Real time push notifications coming from Ropsten on Android (with iOS launching real soon!)\\n\\n\\\\- Alpha dApp that to enable browser notifications and dashboard for services\\n\\n\\\\- Plenty of channels including BTC / ETH Price Tracker, ETH Gas Price, ENS Domain, Wallet Movement Tracker, Compound with a lot more in the works\\n\\n\\\\- And 80% of Protocol features mentioned in the [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.epns.io/)\\n\\nFuture pipeline is looking awesome and we have plans for getting a full fledged protocol with governance, browser notifications, audit, mainnet and Matic launch along with a ton of channels coming out soon.\\n\\n_How soon can the community expect to use EPNS live on Matic?_\\n\\nHaving EPNS on Matic is a priority as Matic is truly an awesome L2 providing all the speed and scalability which we want notifications to have. We have been working on Matic integration in parallel as we see awesome benefits to launch a hybrid protocol, and see the integration to enter into the test phase in less than two months.\\n\\nWe have always envisioned our protocol to fill the communication void between services and users and be scalable and fast. The scalability and fast feature is something which Matic provides to us besides giving us the pleasure to interact with the awesome Matic community (aka you guys!)\\n\\n**_Other Milestones_**\\n\\nMilestones are also measured in learning experiences and we are shameless to plug those details in as well :)\u2026 Though seriously, we have had an exciting roller coaster ride in which we have had the opportunity to be part of amazing learning experiences including:\\n\\n\\\\- Gitcoin Grants Round Top Project with **220 contributors** and match of **$16k**\\n\\n\\\\- Selected as **finalist** in **Gitcoin Kernel** as one of the **top 20 teams**\\n\\n\\\\- Won **grants** from **Matic Network** and **AAVE**\\n\\n\\\\- Selected and mentored by **IDEO CoLab Ventures**. Picked as **30 top teams** from 120+ teams for the program.\\n\\n\\\\- Featured in **Ethereum Foundation, Cointelegraph, YourStory, EthHub** and ton more awesome people\\n\\n\\\\- Speakers at **EthBerlin**, **EDCON**, **Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA)** (upcoming)\\n\\n> Q4.Hearing all of this awesome progress, I think there are many in the community who would love to be part of the EPNS Community and Network, how can people get involved? What are the main products and services that EPNS is providing?\\n\\n**Answer. Harsh:** Thanks for the kind words \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n_I think there are many in the community who would love to be part of the EPNS Community and Network, how can people get involved?_\\n\\nThat\u2019s super awesome, some if not all great ideas belong to our community and building a world\u2019s first something always requires a community that guides and tells us what works and what should be tweaked. TLDR: we love you guys!\\n\\nWe love to get feedback from the community and provide them with the value add they need. For example, even in the alpha version, any web3 user can download our Android / iOS App and head to our dApp and setup notifications like Wallet Movement Tracker, BTC / ETH Price, ETH Gas, ENS Domain expiry to instantly see what we are solving and how it helps them. The incentive part though will come later though we have a sweet sweet surprise for our early adopters and ones that ask hard questions or tell us a feature. This is the first time we have spoken about these rewards and we love to share it with the Matic community first but yes, early adopters have some sweet sweet rewards coming to them real soon :).\\n\\n_What are the main products and services that EPNS is providing?_\\n\\nEPNS is an ecosystem which is flexible and will continue to grow, currently, we are focusing on providing:\\n\\n\\\\- Protocol that enables incentivized, opt-in and decentralized notification interfacing for any smart contract, dApp or traditional service.\\n\\n\\\\- Mobile Apps that enable instant value add by enabling decentralized notifications that are working even when we are on Ropsten network (test network of Ethereum)\\n\\n\\\\- dApp that enables another platform agnostic delivery and provides services that send notifications and for users to subscribe to\\n\\n\\\\- SDKs that will enable instant integration for services and other wallet providers to enable Protocol\\n\\n\\\\- And other node softwares that work in conjunction with each other to enable smooth functioning of these products\\n\\n> Q5.Can you tell us, What are the advantages of using EPNS compared to other notifications Dapps?\\n\\n**Answer.Richa**: Sure! There is no decentralized notification protocol which gives us a first mover advantage to start with :). Usually, people went to solve the blockchain trilemma which is scalability, security and decentralization but didn\u2019t realize that there is an additional pillar and that is communication. We were the first one to identify this and the experience can be simply explained with the following comparison:\\n\\n**Web 2.0 Experience**: Whenever a service has something which is important to you, they reach out to you by notification and you don\u2019t have to keep track of what actions you have done on these services. For example, this TG chat would be a notification for some of you, your whatsapp chats, payments, important news break and even facetime calls are notifications and are then transformed into actions. In essence, services have learned to reach out to users and it increases communication, retention and engagement.\\n\\n**Web 3.0 Experience**: Blockchain lacks this, users are expected to come to services and while it\u2019s an ok experience if you have 1 or 2 dApps or smart contracts which you are interacting with. This quickly deteriorates with multiple services expecting you to keep track of the activities. For example: Loans on DeFi get expired and users don\u2019t get to know. NFTs and Auctions occur and users are unable to learn about them. Governance proposals and DAO fails because users are unable to see and vote on them in time. Security bugs are found but users know about them when it\u2019s too late. The list is practically endless.\\n\\nThis is where notifications protocol comes in and fills the gap. We created a middleware communication layer that any service can use to send notifications to user wallets without any centralized point of failure. This ensures that any dApp or smart contract can just integrate our protocol and is instantly communication ready. There are no projects that exist which are able to do that.\\n\\n> Q6.Matic is Layer 2 scaling solution and EPNS is a DeFi protocol for sending notifications, how will Matic and EPNS work together on their partnership?\\n\\n**Answer.Harsh:** Another great Question! We are a notification protocol at first, though we also are a DeFi protocol as well as the **staking (By Services) \u2014 lending (Via Protocol) \u2014 interest (To Users)** model enables users earnings along with receiving notifications\u2026 woohoo!!\\n\\nBeing a notification protocol, we are essentially a missing piece of Web3 infra which any project will have to integrate to make their experience better. While the communication part is taken care of us, the speed and scalability will come from Matic L2 layer and that\u2019s why this partnership is so close to our heart.\\n\\nps: The Matic team and the way they help us in any and all technical and non-technical aspects is a huge plus as well :). Huge Shoutout to Sandeep, Arjun, JD, Anurag, Sumit, Arun and Ayush for being so awesome to us.\\n\\n> Q7. We know now that EPNS is focusing on sending notifications, a question that naturally arises is how does EPNS mitigate sending spam notifications?\\n\\n**Answer. Harsh:** We actually thought a ton about it and there are couple of ways by which we mitigate the issue (everything happens on protocol :)):\\n\\n1. **Users in Control**: Users have to opt in to receive notifications from a service first before they can start communicating. This ensures that users are always in control, if they unsubscribe, there is no way for a service to add to them.\\n\\n2. **Spam Health Score**: To ensure that a service doesn\u2019t turn malicious later on, we attach a spam score to them as well which is adjusted by both positive (higher number of subscribers, passage of time, etc) and negative (unusual number of notifications, higher number of unsubscribes, etc) actions. This score when it crosses a certain threshold activates the protocol throttle mechanism which is a way to penalize services a bit at first and if they don\u2019t stop then making the throttling go high thereby ensuring that it\u2019s always in the best interest of services to not spam their users.\\n\\n> Q8. How can someone set up his EPNS account and are there any requirements before anyone can start using EPNS?\\n\\n**Answer. Richa:** Sure! beauty of decentralization is in pseudo anonymity of user wallets and posing no requirements \ud83d\ude42. We follow this, all a user (user wallet) has to do is opt in for notifications from services they want on our dApp and that\u2019s it. No centralized signup, no centralized server, just some awesome decentralized notifications that delivers important notifications to you and also rewards you for receiving them \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n> Q9. Can anyone answer if early adoption results in greater rewards, won\u2019t it affect or de-incentivise late comers?? And some rough estimate as a user how much the rewards would be. If I am using INR 5\u201310 worth of tokens in a month and increasing the notifications on my device, why would I be interested, what are other earning mechanisms for end user? \\\\*\\\\*community question\\n\\n**Answer. Richa:** Sure, so early adopters get higher reward to drive users but after a while, the utility of the channel should ensure that people are not just getting driven cause of rewards, and late comers still passively earn, just their rewards begin from the day they join.\\n\\nSure, this really depends on the channel you join, some channels might put up higher rewards (based on their own game theory and incentives). As a user, you never spend any tokens, just opt in for receiving notifications from services you find useful and they communicate important events such as wallet movements, ENS domain expiry, loan liquidation, etc. We just sweeten this deal more by ensuring you are earning passively from them as well.\\n\\n> Q10. Just one more quick question, can mainstream services like e-mail, apps like inshorts, twitter etc be linked to this. Will this require partnership from these or it will just aggregate them on one interface and I can personalize what I want to see(Without any partnership requirements)? I am sure I\u2019ll get this answer on paper but was just curious about this one\\\\*\\\\*community question\\n\\n**Answer. Richa:** Yes, though it can happen both ways :). Either a third party developer (or us) creates a channel that combines them and you as a user select just like you said or we partner with them.\\n\\n# Closing Remarks\\n\\nThanks Arun and the Matic community for hosting and supporting us.

Feels amazing to be with the Bundle Crypto Community.\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: We\u2019re happy to have you here\\n\\nRicha: Thanks Joshuaez for the intro. Hello Awesome Bundle Africa community, great to be here \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: You\u2019re welcome \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\nHarsh: We are founders of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS for short). Think a little intro about EPNS and our team is in order before diving deep into all things Ethereum :).\\n\\n**Our Team**\\n\\nHuge Shoutout to Our Awesome Team!! We are a global team located across continents including Asia, Africa, North America, Central America \ud83d\ude42 Our team brings varied experience and skills across domains and has helped shape the project with a single goal of building a unique product which did not exist.\\n\\n**About EPNS**\\n\\nEPNS is solving the problem of communication, or the lack thereof in Web 3.0. We are creating a decentralized notification protocol that any dApps or smart contracts or any services can use to notify their users (wallet addresses).\\n\\nBut that\u2019s not just it, you as a user are always in control, and are able to passively earn from it as well! And that\u2019s where our DeFi aspects kicks in. Apart from that, we made the deal sweeter by ensuring that users are able to receive these notifications anywhere they want aka EPNS is platform agnostic :).\\n\\nAnd now let\u2019s get started\u2026 We have planned the following list of questions for all you awesome folks though feel free to ask us anything which you think we might have missed and we would love to dive deeper:\\n\\n**\\\\- What is Ethereum?**\\n\\n**\\\\- What is Blockchain?**\\n\\n**\\\\- What is Ethereum\u2026 again?**\\n\\n**\\\\- When was Ethereum created and who created it?**\\n\\n**\\\\- What does the future look like?**\\n\\nRicha: **What is Ethereum?**\\n\\nTo understand Ethereum, we need to understand what is blockchain though I am sure many of you would already know \ud83d\ude09 but here goes nothing.\\n\\n**What is Blockchain?**\\n\\nI am glad you asked\u2026 haha. Blockchain simply put is a way to ensure that any historical data when put in it becomes non tamperable, this is exciting for many reasons but as you might have guessed already. The most fascinating use case of it is that for the very first time in history. We finally have a way to create a form of money that is non-tamperable (not dependent on the whims of a government), unique and truly limited (ie: gold can be found, money can be minted but 1 BTC is always 0.00000004% of total Bitcoin. Same for Ethereum which brings us to addressing the next question.\\n\\nHarsh: Thanks Richa\u2026 seems like you just wrote it and didn\u2019t prepare it in advance at all\u2026 haha\\n\\nHarsh: Alright! so let me handle the next one\\n\\n**What is Ethereum\u2026 again?**\\n\\nEthereum is the second most popular blockchain after Bitcoin as per the market cap. Though unlike Bitcoin which is usually touted as the next innovation in the concept of Money, ETH use cases are aligned more towards creating decentralized applications that can do much more than just transfer money. This is usually done by creating smart contracts which is code executed on blockchain through EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).\\n\\nThese decentralized applications, often called dApps open up a whole new range of utility for blockchain space. Most of you must be aware of DeFi which is majorly built in the Ethereum ecosystem, simply defined, it\u2019s finance on blockchain including lending, borrowing and some other cool use cases.\\n\\nFor example, we now have tokens on Ethereum that have interest built into them which means that they keep on increasing passively (aDAI for example) without you as a user doing anything. This is a big feat, because it paves the way for banking to be on blockchain with interest rates that are global instead of country to county. In the US, the yield or interest rate is often so low on your savings account that it doesn\u2019t make sense but DeFi fixes by offering 5% or more APR (Annual Percentage Rate).\\n\\nThis is not the only utility that can be tapped in, self sovereign identity is another use case. Having control over your data and moving it with you is again a huge advantage. NFTs and Auctions are again something smart contracts open up and so much more. The field is really early but it offers vast improvements over the traditional services.\\n\\nFor example, we at EPNS utilize the DeFi smart contracts to ensure that not only users (wallet addresses) are able to receive notifications but they are able to earn from them as well :).\\n\\n**When was Ethereum created and who created it?**\\n\\nEthereum was released on 30 July 2015 though was proposed in late 2013. While Vitalik was always been associated with Ethereum, It also had a lot more co-founders. Some of the prominent ones are Joseph Lubin (Founder of Consensys) and Gavin Wood (Creator of Polkadot).\\n\\nRicha: Great @harshr, let me handle the next one!\\n\\nHarsh: \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\nRicha : **What does the future looks like ?**:\\n\\nThe future of ETH is only bound by the imaginations of the developers building on top of it. You can practically build anything on top of it and most of the time it will always be better than what we have in terms of current technology services which relies on the server/client technology model, where in we as client are always dependent on the whims of the server to provide us with access and trust what we see.\\n\\nThe future of groundbreaking tech though really depends on scalability and speed. Both of which is what we see ETH 2.0 and several Layer 2 services on ETH trying to tackle. This race has actually always been chasing the Blockchain Trilemma, where it has been dictated that you can only choose to have two out of three things in your blockchain: Security, Scalability and Decentralization.\\n\\nThe one to achieve this blockchain trilemma is going to be the one that changes the entire web 3.0 landscape and Ethereum is well poised to do so. Another shameless plug, so apart from the blockchain trilemma, we also feel that communication as in services coming to users instead of other way round (like how it is currently in blockchain) is another thing which will help a blockchain win, that\u2019s us btw ;).\\n\\nFuture of Ethereum looks awesome. One thing that Ethereum has gotten going for itself is the awesome community they have been able to gather and what we have seen so far is that community is resilient to the platform they come to, so it\u2019s not easy to make them switch, that\u2019s why many blockchains even when they are a bit better than ETH sometime in terms of speed is still not able to provide quality and useful smart contracts (or dApps) that Ethereum ecosystem is able to provide..\\n\\nHarsh: Thanks Richa for tackling the question, @Joshuaez Think we are done with this segment and can move to next \ud83d\ude42\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: Great, thank you for the awesome Session.\\n\\nSurely you guys explain all we needed to know about Ethereum.\\n\\nHarsh:\ud83d\ude4f\\n\\nRicha: \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\\n\\n# Segment 2: Community Questions\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: So, this brings us to segment 2, we\u2019ll open the group so our members can ask questions, then you\u2019ll will select and answer the 5 most insightful questions.\\n\\nRicha: sure, sounds good\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: The group will be open in..\\n\\n5\ufe0f\u20e3\\n\\n4\ufe0f\u20e3\\n\\n3\ufe0f\u20e3\\n\\n2\ufe0f\u20e3\\n\\n1\ufe0f\u20e3\\n\\nQ: Will ethereum surpass Bitcoin in value?\\n\\nQ: Could you explain more about EPNS?\\n\\nQ: You explained in the write up that Ethereum aimed at decentralized applications. My question is, is there any relationship between Ethereum and Ethereum classic? And is Ethereum classic a sub under Ethereum?\\n\\nQ: \ud83d\udd36How will the Ethereum 2.0 protocol affect the price of ETH, it\u2019s efficiency and scalability over the coming months and years?\\n\\nQ: Ethereum push notifications, are they only peculiar to dapps and smart contract address or to the whole Ethereum address?\\n\\nQ: Can you please explain the basic different between Ethereum and Ethereum Push Notification\\n\\nQ: You made mention of tokens that generates interest without doing anything, are these interest dependent on the price of such token?\\n\\nQ: Who are the remaining founder apart from the one listed\\n\\nQ: How does gas fee affect eth workability\\n\\nQ: Privacy is one of the strength and flaws of the Blockchain technology today, what\u2019s the level of privacy on messages sent over EPNS?\\n\\nQ: Has EPNS been launched and what\u2019s the your teams roadmap for its deployment\\n\\nQ: What is the effect of the DApp in Ethereum price\\n\\nQ: How does ethereum smart contract works?\\n\\nQ: There are over 10,000 cryptos, and some are built on Ethereum blockchain as we know.\\n\\nSo what\u2019s the probability that this very project is unique in its utility and would drag attention and mass adoption amongst other Ethereum Defi\u2019s ? Kindly state why, how and the strategies you would deploy in the crypto market !\\n\\nQ: What is the Ethereum network?\\n\\nQ: What is the level of privacy on messages sent over EPNS.\\n\\nQ: What are the real-world use-cases of Ethereum?\\n\\nQ: I still don\u2019t understand how we can earn passively in EPNS, and is it risk-free?\\n\\nQ: Over the years, Ethereum has always had the highest transfer charges\u2026at a time, it was close to $20\u2026does ESPN bring a solution.to.this?\\n\\nIf yes, How?\\n\\n**Responses to top 5 Questions by EPNS team**\\n\\n**Q1. There are over 10,000 cryptos, and some are built on Ethereum blockchain as we know.**\\n\\n**So what\u2019s the probability that this very project is unique in its utility and would drag attention and mass adoption amongst other Ethereum Defi\u2019s ? Kindly state why, how and the strategies you would deploy in the crypto market !**\\n\\nAwesome question!\\n\\nYou are right. There are 1000s of projects and tokens in the cryptosphere.\\n\\nWhat makes us more attractive and unique is that we are in our core an Infrastructure project. We are helping set a solid foundation so the entire Ethereum Ecosystem can grow.\\n\\nWe are a project in service of other projects!\\n\\nWe found a very interesting mix on how to create a win-win situation for all participants.\\n\\nBusiness will increase customer attraction and retention, and clients will earn from all this.\\n\\nWin-Win!\\n\\n**Q2. What is the level of privacy on messages sent over EPNS.**\\n\\nWe had an eye on the privacy of the messages from the very start :). There are three levels of privacy on EPNS currently and it all depends on what the service wants to communicate to their users (subscribers).\\n\\na) Broadcast \u2014 This type of message is plain and is more like how a person communicates over twitter to their followers, useful in getting critical information or alerts out like a security audit, bug, governance voting or even an awesome AMA.\\n\\nb) Targeted \u2014 This type of message is still plain but meant for a specific user, kind of like when your loan is about to be liquidated or your ENS domain is expiring or your wallet has seen movement of funds (incoming / outgoing). These are information that are out in public domain and hence doesn\u2019t need encryption\\n\\nc) Encrypted \u2014 These are as the name suggests encrypted and only the user will be able to see them. We do it via public / private key encryption which means the message is encrypted using your public key so your private key can only open it and thus you as the user is only able to see it, this is very similar to how Bitcoin or Ethereum encryption operates and hence is very secure\\n\\nWhile these are the three privacy level we support currently, the beauty of our protocol is that it\u2019s infinitely extensible which means other more complex privacy level can be added in the future and they will be automagically available for the services / users to use.\\n\\n**Q3. I still don\u2019t understand how we can earn passively in EPNS, and is it risk-free?**\\n\\nSure! Happy to answer and of course it\u2019s totally risk free, in fact you as a user never have to deposit anything on our protocol, you just earn token incentives magically :).\\n\\nWhile designing the EPNS decentralized notification protocol we wanted to design a WIN-WIN scenario for both the Users (receivers of the notifications) as well as Services (senders of the notification).\\n\\nOur protocol requires a service to activate themselves before they can send notifications, this is a one time step and the activation requires deposit a one-time stake fee.\\n\\nThis stake fee is then automatically lend out to AAVE protocol and starts generating interest. This generated interest is then distributed to the subscribers of the channel (service) in a weighted fashion thus making the notifications incentivized for the users :).\\n\\nYou can also deep dive about it in our whitepaper.\\n\\n**Q4. How does gas fee affect eth workability**\\n\\nAnother great question. ETH works on the concept of gas, which means that any operation you do is charged as units of gas, the gas fee is essentially the current ongoing rate of gas in Ether (ETH).\\n\\nSince ETH is more like a decentralized computer for all the smart contracts running over it, this also means that apart from the transfer of ETH from one party to another, it is also used for countless other operations (like calculations you do in your code) for different things in a smart contract.\\n\\nThese things can be computationally expensive at times or might be meager which means they have different gas requirements, and since gas price is measured in ether, the gas fee is always done as gas_required_for_an_operation X current_gas_price\\n\\nThis means that if the current_gas_price (measured in ETH) goes up than the transaction becomes more expensive to perform. As with the rule of demand and supply, if the gas fee is higher, the network becomes expensive to use and thereby will have less people using it.\\n\\nThis is the reason why gas fee affect eth workablitily\\n\\n**Q5. You explained in the write up that Ethereum aimed at decentralized applications. My question is, is there any relationship between Ethereum and Ethereum classic? And is Ethereum classic a sub under Ethereum?**\\n\\nIt\u2019s a really nice question. Ethereum classic is a fork of Ethereum and in some way the original chain. Not many are aware now, but when Ethereum was launched, shortly after that, a hacker was able to drain majority of Ethereum funds out through a DAO hack.\\n\\nThis led Vitalik and co to fork the main chain to invalidate these transactions and led to the age old question that if code is a law then should it be forked? Nevertheless, some people believe and still do that code is law and they stuck to the original chain which became Ethereum Classic and the new chain became known as Ethereum.\\n\\nJoshua \u26a1| Bundle Team: Wow, this are excellent answers, thank you Richa and Harsh, you guys are awesome.\\n\\nHarsh: Thanks again for hosting us @Joshuaez!

We were thrilled to see such an overwhelming response from the community for EPNS and thoroughly enjoyed answering community member\u2019s amazing questions.\\n\\n**_Date_**_: Thursday, 12th November, 2020  \\n_**_Time_**_: 10:00 UTC_\\n\\n_Find the AMA transcript below:_\\n\\n# Part 1: Introduction\\n\\n> _Q1 : Can you please introduce yourselves and your backgrounds. Also share details about the Team working on EPNS_\\n\\n**Harsh:** Sure I guess I will go first. Hey Everyone! I am Harsh, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service. Some background about me, I love all things tech and have as a byproduct gathered 11+ years of experience in dabbling across various spectrums of tech and design in almost all popular fields (mobile, web services, saas and of course Blockchain).\\n\\n**Richa:**Thanks for question! I am co-founder of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS). I handle multiple jobs at EPNS though am focused on mostly Marketing and Product. Before EPNS, I worked with companies like Deloitte, Wipro etc. and have close to 12 years of techno-functional experience in various aspects of product management, design and various spectrums.\\n\\n**Harsh:** Team: We have a globalized team of developers, marketeers and awesome peeps. The team has 5 leads (Project, Marketing, Strategy, Protocol / BizDev, Product / Engineering). Though, the entire team is flat and everyone wears multiple hats.\\n\\n> _Q2 : Can you introduce the EPNS Project, do you have any competitor and what critical problems does it solve_\\n\\n**Harsh:** Sure, EPNS is aimed at solving the missing piece of web3 which is ironically communications by service to users. Users are still expected in the blockchain world to keep track of their actions and services expect users to come to them. This might be fine when you dabble with 1 or 2 services but with the way blockchain has expanded, it really is a huge problem now. For example, your loans are liquidated with you finding about it, NFTs / Auctions come and go, critical governance actions are missed, and the list goes on.\\n\\nEPNS fixes this by creating a decentralized notifications protocol that any service can use to send notifications to their users (wallet addresses). The protocol is platform agnostic which means the notifications can come to any platform (iOS, Android, Chrome or crypto wallets). Besides solving this communication gap, the DeFi aspect of the protocol enables incentivized notifications which means that not only you as user can receive notifications but you also earn from them as well.\\n\\nWe are the first one to address this problem so no competitors yet \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n> _Q3 : Can you briefly describe the Top milestones you have achieved and your target milestones with timelines, also share your roadmap_\\n\\n**Richa:** We have had an awesome journey! We identified this huge pain point of lack of communication in Web3 in January, Ideation and loads of research took a couple of months after which we took the idea to **Ethereum Foundation**, from there we were lucky to be guided to **EthGlobal HackMoney,** after which we got selected and mentored by IDEO in their product validation day (PVD) and then got selected in **Gitcoin Kernel accelerator** / **incubator**, which is one of the most prestigious accelerator in our space. We are loving this roller coaster ride.\\n\\nCurrent phase is protocol and product features refinement by showing the product to users & services and learning what things they feel good about and what things require to be changed.\\n\\nYes! The product is already in alpha and available for early access users. We are on ropsten already with majority features working. A few features related to spam throttling and governance are in the works.\\n\\nAlpha dApp: [https://app.epns.io/](https://app.epns.io/)\\n\\nAlpha mobile app: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.epns.epns](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.epns.epns)\\n\\n![Image of EPNS AMA with \ud83c\udf99 AMA LOVERS CLUB](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nMilestones\\n\\n![Image of EPNS AMA with \ud83c\udf99 AMA LOVERS CLUB](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nAchivements\\n\\n# **Part 2: Twitter Questions**\\n\\n> _Q1: EPNS is building the worlds first decentralized finance notification protocol on Ethereum. What mechanism have you put in place to help ensure that you don\u2019t just deliver plain notifications to your users? How exactly will you be adding value to the DEFI space with your solution?_\\n\\n**Harsh:** That\u2019s an awesome question. To ensure that notifications are meaningful and targeted, we have created content abstraction in the protocol itself, which simply means that there is a notification type assigned to each notification sent. This type defines: 1) Which decentralized storage the payload is stored at (IPFS for now), 2) How to interpret and display the payload (Whether it contains CTA, Images, Video or even encrypted txs and how to display them), 3) To whom the notification is intended to, ie: whether it\u2019s a broadcast, meant for specific users or is encrypted by user public key (and thus can only be seen by the intended user). These three classification ensures that notifications are rich in nature and has use cases for any scenario, since these types are also extensible, we can keep on adding different specs as more people tell us what they need.\\n\\nAnother thing I forgot to mention is that the service sends whatever notifications they want to their user (as they are in the best position to decide that). Also, the user needs to opt in as a one time step to start receiving notifications (very similar to how you install an app on your phone and it asks for your permission to send you alerts and can only deliver them to you if you say yes)\\n\\n**AMALoversClub Team:** It\u2019s a detailed answer\\n\\n**Harsh:**\ud83d\ude05\\n\\n> _Q2 : Regarding prevention of rug pull, how does the 2 day grace period from the time of minting until the tokens enter the AMM, help/warn liquidity providers of an exit scam?_\\n\\n**Harsh**: Assuming this is talking about different projects doing AMM, the cool thing of epns is genuine communication between a project and their users which can even be watchdogs keeping an eye on projects and alerting their subscribers instantly on a shady project\\n\\n**Richa:** You can also read more uses cases in this article [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/13-defi-notifications-ethereum-needs-today-df4dcc98a797](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/13-defi-notifications-ethereum-needs-today-df4dcc98a797)\\n\\n> _Q3 : Can you explain briefly what the Alpha Production dApp is all about? How will the dAPP improve the EPNS project?_\\n\\nSure, the dApp provides a list of active channels (services) for user wallets to opt in and start receiving notifications.\\n\\nCurrently, we have ETH/BTC price alerts, GasPrice, ENS Domain Expiry, Bankless FR which are sending useful notifications already. User Wallet Tracker, Compound liquidation are coming soon :). The dApp provides users to see and opt in for notifications from all the services available on the protocol.\\n\\nIt will also provide dashboard for users to see their rewards, enable browser notifications and provide services with frontend to send manual notifications (AMA, bug report) as well in the future\\n\\n# Part 3: Live TG Community Questions\\n\\n> _Q1 : I understand that EPNS mainly focus on notifications, so I want to know if your notification could be integrated into platforms like telegram, Twitter, etc. Or on which platform could your notification function?_\\n\\nYes, we are platform agnostic though current focus is sending notifications directly to user wallets, TG and Twitter or other platforms will come in future\\n\\n> _Q2 : PRIVACY is an issue when subscribed to services like EPNS, what is the standard of your security and privacy ?_\\n\\nSetting the bar high, no centralized signup, your wallet acts as your username and no private info is taken ever!\\n\\n> _Q3 : How can Decentralized Notifications can Revolutionize On-Chain Governance_\\n\\nGreat Q! One of the main issues in current on-chain governance voting model is low user turnout and voter apathy. EPNS can help provide a decentralized mode of communication between services and users and help bridge the gap when it comes to governance. Giving power back to people! We also wrote an article about it -: [https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/how-decentralised-notifications-can-revolutionize-on-chain-governance-part-i-ff09e7465279](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/how-decentralised-notifications-can-revolutionize-on-chain-governance-part-i-ff09e7465279)\\n\\n> _Q4 : EPNS notification protocol implements game theory, DeFi. And now EPNS has products such as:_\\n>\\n> _\u2022 Mobile App  \\n> \u2022 dApp  \\n> \u2022 EPNS Infra (Push Service)  \\n> \u2022 Showrunners  \\n> \u2022 JS Library_\\n>\\n> _Of all these products. I still haven\u2019t found any products related to DeFi. In the future, does EPNS have plans to add products or services such as loans, borrowers and etc ..?_\\n\\nThe DeFi aspect is in the protocol. Notifications are incentivized as we require services to activate themselves by staking DAI which is lend out to AAVE to start generating interest, users who opt in to receive notifications from the service automatically get a share from the generated interest\\n\\n\ud83d\ude05 more info on this soon\u2026\\n\\nEPNS provides a middleware for all services to interact and send notifications to user wallets, it brings the experience of web 2 finally to web 3. And then we make it sweeter by making it platform agnostic and incentivized \ud83d\ude03\\n\\n> _Q5 : How does EPNS work? For our users to understand better, can you explain the advantages and uniqueness of EPNS will bring?_\\n\\nEPNS provides a middleware for all services to interact and send notifications to user wallets, it brings the experience of web 2 finally to web 3. And then we make it sweeter by making it platform agnostic and incentivized \ud83d\ude03\\n\\n> _Q6 : What is the advantage solutions and feature that generates by ethereum Push notification partnership with AAVE!?_\\n\\nI think the question is how are we using AAVE protocol. User incentives in EPNS are generated by a process of Staking (By Services) \u2014 Lending (Via Protocol) \u2014 Interest (To Users) using DeFi. Staking happens from the service (who wants to send notifications), they activate themselves on the protocol by depositing 50 DAI or higher. This deposit doesn\u2019t come to us, but rather goes into the Lending pool. Lending happens via protocol \u2014 We integrate with AAVE protocol to lend the staked amount to the service which then starts generating interest.\\n\\nWe have also won a grant from AAVESOME AAVE team -: [https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1300356100173131781](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1300356100173131781)\\n\\n> _Q7 : \ud83d\udd14Q1  \\n> There is a difference between receiving notifications that we consider important and receiving spam, so what is the method that ENPS applies to avoid spam?_\\n>\\n> _\ud83d\udd14Q2  \\n> What would be the characteristics of the public that ENPS is targeting? Or are they aimed at a general public?_\\n\\nAnswer for Q1) Awesome thinking, users opt in for notifications from a specific service before the service can send notifications, and they can opt out at any point\u2026 therefore spamming is counterproductive, this combined with our spam throttle algo ensures user centric protocol.\\n\\nAnswer for Q2) Communication is essential for everything though if we have to pick one segment first, it really is needed for all things DeFi\\n\\n> _Q8 : How can we start earning on EPNS, what is needed to be done and how much we receive per notification sent to us, what are crypto assets we can get and what devices can be used for earning?  \\n> Can we apply for our advertisement so other people receive notifications and how?_\\n\\nAs a user, just opt in for notifications from service that interest you. Earnings are passively generated from the protocol and you as a user don\u2019t have to do anything, it will accumulate for you automatically :)\\n\\n> _Q9 : Does $EPNS not have a road map?_\\n\\nWe do and have shared above\u2026 though we are also working on a detailed timeline one and will be opening it soon to public\\n\\n> _Q10 : Is there an idea and motivation when you find that the target EPNS is striving for is a potential job with the development of the defi blockchain?  \\n> EPNS recently announced that it will use AAVE to generate income for users. So what conditions do users need and how to make money from the platform here?_\\n\\nThe motivation and vision of EPNS is to become a Web3 standard for notifications. Web3 is growing at an exponential rate. With applications like DeFi (loan liqudation, change in interest ratio), DEX (trade order), domain name service (expiration period), NFT buying and selling, gaming and many more, a genuine medium of decentralized communication was missing. Hence, the genesis of Ethereum Push Notification.  \\nSecond part of the Q, users simply needs to connect to EPNS app and opt in for notification of favorite channels from [https://app.epns.io/](https://app.epns.io/). For user incentives please refer the section of whitepaper [https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/epns-protocol/subscribers/user-direct-action-subscribe#game-theory-and-user-incentives](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/epns-protocol/subscribers/user-direct-action-subscribe#game-theory-and-user-incentives)\\n\\n> _Q11 : You stated on your white paper that \u201cUsers will be able to earn token incentives based on some of their direct or indirect actions within the EPNS protocol\u201d.How much is the token incentives and for how long would they receive it?_\\n\\nThere are multiple ways for token incentives, one is the passive interest which I explained above, few others are through governance participation, usage mining (our form of liquidity mining) and some more. We will be sharing in-depth guide for each soon!\\n\\n> _Q12 : How will EPNS solve the following problems :  \\n> 1\\\\. Users not receiving notifications if loan is about getting liquidated  \\n> 2\\\\. Users not getting progress status of trade orders placed on DEX  \\n> 3\\\\. Users not getting simple notifications from projects._\\n\\nCreating the notifications middleware solves this problem which is already live on ropsten and working for few services. Check out: [https://app.epns.io](https://app.epns.io/)\\n\\n> _Q13 : The protocol the EPNS uses can incentivize users who receive notifications. Does that mean that we as users can receive incentives when using EPNS and how do you get these incentives?_\\n\\nThanks! Yes, there is a passive incentive for users who opt for notifications. Please refer whitepaper [https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/epns-protocol/subscribers/user-direct-action-subscribe#game-theory-and-user-incentives](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/epns-protocol/subscribers/user-direct-action-subscribe#game-theory-and-user-incentives)\\n\\n> _Q14 : How can the EPNS ensure storage, broadcast and sending notification? Is there a special groove used?_\\n\\nGood Q! Please refer [https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/specifications/notification-payload-specs#payload-types](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/specifications/notification-payload-specs#payload-types)\\n\\n> _Q15 : What are the main products and services that EPNS is bringing to the market today? Why did you choose this as the main and central factor to develop EPNS?_\\n\\nOur whitepaper (products segment) outlines this: [whitepaper.epns.io](http://whitepaper.epns.io/)\\n\\n> _Q16 : When your team developed EPNS, did you take into consideration the feedback and needs of the community? How do you rate EPNS\u2019s long-term market as positive? What difficulties do you face during this period?_\\n\\nWe did, IDEO PVD taught us that listening to users and services are a ongoing effort which we have continued doing bi-weekly to ensure that product features come from users and services and not from us. Some of the really neat and creative protocol features (if not all) are from those interviews :)\\n\\n> _Q17 : What Type Of Notification Does $EPNS want To Push?_\\n\\nWe don\u2019t define what notifications can or can\u2019t be sent by a service, we figured that the service know what\u2019s best to communicate with their users and hence they decide what they want to send\\n\\n> _Q18 : At this point, do you think you need to communicate as a balance of growth? Or is it better to forget these things and focus on other activities? The marketing of EPNS is well known that every item in encryption needs to be adopted to achieve growth. So, what are the future plans for large-scale adoption of EPNS?_\\n\\nImo delivering a product that\u2019s needed takes care of the growth as projects in Ethereum are run by really awesome folks that never hesitate to become better. We are however catalyzing this by driving awareness, creating instant value add product and interacting with awesome users like you :)\\n\\n> _Q19 : What is the preferred way for you to receive this platform to dAPPs or other web3 services?_\\n\\nRn, notifications are supported on our Android app with ios and browse notifications coming soon. So preferred way currently are just our app though the end goal is to have notifications coming to crypto wallets and the user decides where they want to receive them\\n\\n> _Q20 : Notifications are stored and treated like a JSON payload. Can you explain what a JSON payload is and how it works in EPNS?_\\n\\nSure, the notifications payloads segment in the whitepaper talks in great depth about this: [whitepaper.epns.io](http://whitepaper.epns.io/)\\n\\n> _Q21 : Since your app with be having Access to customers wallet and private keys.. Then security on your app is a concern.. How good is your security and do you have any security threats_\\n\\nWe have a open repo from get go and normal users are encouraged to sign in with just public wallet address as most notifications are going to be non encrypted for now.\\n\\n# Closing Remarks\\n\\nThanks for having us guys.

The reason is very obvious \u2014 The US Elections. People turned to prediction markets trying to make a quick buck by predicting who will emerge victorious to get the keys to the White House. But decentralized prediction markets (DPM) aren\u2019t just used to predict the next President of the US, but it aims to be a place to predict any event that could possibly happen in the real world. No matter what it is you want to predict \u2014 be it the next President, the weather for tomorrow, the prices of cryptos like Bitcoin, or even the price of oranges next week.\\n\\n![Image of Notify Decentralized Prediction Markets (DPM) with EPNS](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\\n\\nIn this article, we will discuss about prediction markets, its working, and how decentralized notifications can help bridge the gap between markets and its users!\\n\\n### **Prediction Markets**\\n\\nA Market can be any place where people come to buy and sell commodities. This can be either online (Stock Market, E-commerce stores, etc) or a physical store (Grocery, Supermarkets, etc). A prediction market is more or less the same thing but instead of buying and selling any commodity, you buy and sell predictions (or shares of that prediction, just like you buy shares of a company in the stock market.). These predictions could be anything. It is usually :\\n\\n1.  **_Tied to some real-world event._**\\n2.  **_Something that has a finite and definite outcome._**\\n3.  **_Has considerably fewer possible outcomes, such as 2 or 3._**\\n4.  **_And also something isn\u2019t very easy to predict (like what is the weather going to be like tomorrow) already but has high stakes._**\\n\\nAs [Augur](https://augur.net/ipfs/trading/), a DPM puts it, \u201c There are two types of shares in a prediction market: YES (long) shares and NO (short) shares. The ultimate value (payout) of each share depends on whether an event occurs or not. In a simple prediction market, each YES share pays out a dollar if the event in question occurs and pays out nothing if it does not occur. Each NO share pays out a dollar if the event does not occur and nothing if it does.\u201d\\n\\nCurrently, most prediction markets are centralized and hence face the common problems faced by most centralized financial institutions today.\\n\\nThese are:\\n\\n1.  **_They are closed, siloed, and highly regulated._**\\n2.  **_The risk of markets being shut down by regulators discourages participation._**\\n3.  **_Low betting caps, hence preventing high-confidence players from sufficiently and accurately expressing their conviction and moving the markets by trading at higher amounts._**\\n4.  **_They usually have high trading fees._**\\n\\nDPMs like [Augur](https://twitter.com/AugurProject), [Omen](https://twitter.com/Omen_eth), [Gnosis](https://twitter.com/gnosisPM), [Stox](https://twitter.com/stx_coin), and [Polymarket](https://twitter.com/PolymarketHQ), built on top of Etherum have shown us that, it is absolutely possible to have Decentralized Prediction Markets but we have to caution ourselves that it is still a new experimental idea and the feasibility and risk associated is still high.\\n\\nWith the rise of hype associated with the recently concluded US Elections, DPMs have been riding the tide on the rise to their popularity. According to an article by CoinTelegraph, the [Matic](https://twitter.com/maticnetwork)\\\\-powered decentralized prediction platform Polymarket saw significant trade, posting a new volume record of more than $10 million.\\n\\n**YTRUMP** and **NTRUMP** tokens from the Augur- and Balancer-powered Catnip Exchange drove around $1.3 million in speculative action over the past 24 hours.\\n\\nAugur also saw significant action, reporting $8.6 million in total election volume, and $4.75 million in open interest.\\n\\n[Ethhub](https://twitter.com/ethhub_io) and [TheDailyGwei](https://t.co/PdcbhdHNgv?amp=1) founder [Anthony Sassano](https://twitter.com/sassal0x) noted the opportunity that the election provides for decentralized prediction platforms to attract users, [stating](https://thedailygwei.substack.com/p/predict-this-the-daily-gwei-110?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo5ODExMjIxLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNzQ0MjkzMiwiXyI6Ik9KZkhEIiwiaWF0IjoxNjA0NTMyMDA2LCJleHAiOjE2MDQ1MzU2MDYsImlzcyI6InB1Yi01Mjg5MyIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.RX9Wbw0nyb7QqUsKRBy4tfWKdffQEzF-wIM59EmfhNk):\\n\\n> It seems that prediction markets finally found their stride because there was a market for people to bet on that they actually cared about.\\n\\n[Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) also got into the discussion during the eve of election night to mention that DPMs have proven to be a much more accurate representation of the elections, by stating 3 hypotheses that he shared on Twitter (as seen below).\\n\\n# **The Need for Notifications in DPMs**\\n\\nBetting on or buying shares of predictions sounds cool for the most part, but DPMs don\u2019t currently have a method to let you know when new predictions are made open or when existing ones are closed.\\n\\nWith the help of EPNS, DPMs will be able to send notifications and allow their users to stay up to date on the recent happenings within the platform.\\n\\nSome use cases are mentioned below but are not limited to them. They are :\\n\\n## **1\\\\. When new Prediction pools are listed**\\n\\n_\u201cWill Trump be re-elected for 2021?\u201d, \u201cWill Bitcoin cross $16k?\u201d, \u201cWill FC Barcelona beat Real Madrid in the next El Clasico?\u201d._\\n\\nAs days pass if DPMs want to stay relevant they must list relevant prediction pools on their platform, and also let their users know about it! Prediction markets get more accurate as more people participate in it. By adding notifications to the picture, DPMs can ensure that interested people will stake their funds into the pools as well as users can stay updated on what are the possible predictions they can invest in!\\n\\n## **2\\\\. When prediction markets fluctuate**\\n\\nMarket outcomes and predictions can fluctuate as time passes as more data on the topic come to light. Often this leads to one side of the prediction being favored more and hence gets more costly.\\n\\nConsider you take the case of dice and you are to predict the outcome when rolled would either be an odd or even number. This turns out to be a 50% probability, hence equalling the price of the shares, but later if it is revealed that the dice is 4sided, then the probability shifts as there is a shift of probability to 75/25 ratio, hence making one of the shares cost more!\\n\\nLetting users know when the price changes drastically or when the market favoring changes, will allow them to make educated decisions on whether to sell, hold, or buy shares.\\n\\n## **3\\\\. When the market closes**\\n\\nSince prediction markets are tied to some real-world event or probable outcome, and within a definite time, markets will close a listing when the real-world event occurs and hence will result in users either gaining or losing based on the shares they have in hand.\\n\\nWith notifications, a participant in the prediction market can be notified when the market closes and also be aware of how much they have won or lost. This in turn also allows the participants in the market who won to claim their shares and withdraw money in a timely manner. In case there is any delay in the result of the outcome of the event, then this information can be passed on to the user as well.\\n\\n## **4\\\\. General Predictions**\\n\\nDPMs can help create network effects and also help you plan your actions accordingly. For example, if a DPM notifies you that there is an 80% chance that the price of ETH will cross $500 in the first week of December with the release of Ethereum 2.0, you would plan to stock up on some ETH before the price increase, hence creating scarcity and eventually increasing its price. Similarly, if you get notified that there is a 65% chance of there being a traffic jam at 8 am on Monday, then you would plan accordingly to get to work. Convenient, isn\u2019t it?\\n\\n# **Conclusion**\\n\\nLooking at the above use cases one can deduce that notifications are crucial for every stage of a prediction lifecycle for a decentralized prediction market. DPMs are still quite early in the game, and sometimes the user participation levels are quite low because of the lack of stake or interest in existing predictions being listed on such platforms. One could hope these platforms to grow day by day and eventually beat their centralized counterparts into being more mainstream, and they already have proved to be more accurate. Another way to look at it is that \u201care DPMs too advanced an ambition or a concept too early for its time?\u201d One can only wait and see where this goes.\\n\\nEPNS is a decentralized notification service, where one can receive notifications in a decentralized way for the decentralized protocols they use. Often dubbed to be the \u201cmissing piece in Web3 and blockchain\u201d EPNS lends its hand in utilities across a variety and multitude of decentralized platforms.\\n\\nPredictions are looking awesome for EPNS to play a key role in decentralization.\\n\\n_References:_\\n\\n[_https://augur.net/blog/prediction-markets/_](https://augur.net/blog/prediction-markets/)[_https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-powered-prediction-market-flourish-during-us-presidential-election_](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-powered-prediction-market-flourish-during-us-presidential-election)\\n\\nBecome part of our buzzing community!

The content of the Litepaper is included in the article below.\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThe document introduces a decentralized notifications protocol that enables wallet addresses to receive notifications in a platform-agnostic fashion from both decentralized and centralized carriers. _Examples of platforms can be dApps, User Wallets, iOS and Android apps, Chrome or Firefox browsers, or any other such platforms._\\n\\nIt also explores and describes the theory and technical aspects of the protocol/platform and the game theory that the protocol utilizes to ensure incentives for good actors in the ecosystem.\\n\\n# The Problem\\n\\nThe blockchain space is growing at an extremely rapid pace and the exponential growth is projected to continue rapidly in terms of users, services, and revenue. Despite this growth, services (dApps, platforms, services, smart contracts) still lack a genuine and decentralized communication medium with their users. Today, communication between provider and consumer often occurs on mediums like email, social media like Twitter, and community platforms like Telegram. These methods defeat the purpose of Web3.0.\\n\\nBelow are quick summaries of pain points that Web3.0 services currently have, and how the lack of a decentralized communication layer results in missing events, actions, and other important updates.\\n\\n- On AAVE, Compound, and other DeFi protocols, users don\u2019t learn about their loan liquidations until they manually check, since there is no way for users to receive notifications.\\n- Every time a trade order is placed on a DEX, the user is expected to manually check the service or their wallet address to see if the trade is completed or not.\\n- ENS domain expiry has to be put on Twitter in the hopes that the grace domain user might read it.\\n- Inform users whenever their governance tokens can be used on important proposals, as well as the status and time left for any active governance proposals.\\n- Instead of waiting for a tweet, a PoolTogether lottery winner in the future can simply receive their winning lottery via notification.\\n- Availability of digital art on a decentralized marketplace or limited edition NFTs can be shared with users by simple notification.\\n- Announcements of new protocol feature launch are shared in real-time with users.\\n\\nThese examples highlight a critical pain point in Web3.0 communication, and the problem will only worsen as services and dApps keep growing, especially within DeFi.\\n\\n# **The Solution**\\n\\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is a blockchain protocol that enables services to communicate with its users (wallet addresses) in a decentralized way. The DeFi aspect of the protocol ensures the notifications are incentivized i.e. users will also be receiving token incentives from the notifications.\\n\\nFurthermore, The decentralized nature of the protocol enables delivery to any centralized or decentralized platforms which paves the way for communication to occur across any platform whether it\u2019s a mobile app, user crypto wallets, web browsers or any other platform that chooses to integrate the protocol.\\n\\n# **EPNS Protocol**\\n\\n## High Level Application Flow\\n\\n![Image of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) Litepaper](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nHigh level application flow\\n\\n## Definitions\\n\\nThe following definitions are used to refer to certain roles in the ecosystem.\\n\\nRoles\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nEPNS is a notification protocol at its heart. Built on top of Ethereum, It is a fully decentralized middleware layer that enables any dApps, smart contracts, or traditional services to communicate with their users in a privacy-centric (wallet address) and decentralized fashion.\\n\\nAmong other things, the middleware ensures a spam free, user-centric, opt-in, transparent environment for the services and users to communicate.\\n\\nThe protocol also assigns a content type to payloads which essentially means that the services are free to communicate whatever information they want with the users, ie: Sending images, call to actions, videos, or even encrypted transactions. Various examples of payloads and how they operate are further provided in the whitepaper. [**\\\\[**Read in Detail**\\\\]**](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/specifications/notification-payload-specs#payload-types)\\n\\n## Protocol Features\\n\\n## Incentivized Notifications for Users\\n\\nThe protocol requires services that want to send notifications to their subscribers to activate themselves by staking $DAI, this **stake** is then **lend** out by protocol to AAVE DeFi protocol (at the time of writing) and starts generating **interest** which is then distributed in a weighted proportion to all the subscribers that have opted in to receive notifications, the weightage rewards the early subscribers a bit more as they become the early adopters. [**\\\\[**Read in Detail**\\\\]**](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/epns-protocol/channels/channel-activation-deactivation#game-theory-and-user-incentives)\\n\\n## Platform Agnostic\\n\\nThe protocol allows retrievable information (encrypted or plain) of each notification. IPFS stores most of the payload storage, but different storage (decentralized or centralized) are possible in the future for different payload types. This enables universal notification delivery to any crypto wallets, mobile apps, web browsers, dApps, or other platforms as long as they integrate the protocol. As a reward for the integration, the fees paid by the service for these notifications is shared between all wallets and infrastructure providers that enable the delivery of notifications to user wallets. [\\\\[Read in Detail\\\\]](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/specifications/notification-payload-specs#notification-json-payload)\\n\\n## Flexible (Arbitrary) Payload\\n\\nNotification is stored and treated like JSON payload which is transformed as per the rules of the different carriers when the notification reaches them. JSON Payload can differ with payload types which ensures the flexibility of the content, data, storage interpretation, and delivery. This helps in creating different rules and content interpretation of the notification (for example: carrying images, call to action, live videos, etc). [**\\\\[**Read in Detail**\\\\]**](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/specifications/notification-payload-specs#notification-json-payload)\\n\\n## User-Centric and opt-in notifications\\n\\nThe protocol allows users to be in direct control of what services they get notification from; it imposes rules on the services including spam protection for users, limiting their ability to add wallets as subscribers, etc. [**\\\\[**Read in Detail**\\\\]**](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/epns-protocol/subscribers/user-direct-action-subscribe)\\n\\n## Spam score and throttling\\n\\nEach channel has a spam score that ranges from 0\u20131. Value of 0 means the channel has an excellent score and 1 means the channel is very unhealthy. The range adjusts based on positive actions such as a higher number of subscribers, with the passing of time while negative actions are higher than usual unsubscribers, higher than usual notifications, etc. This is guided by the protocol and at a certain range, the protocol will start throttling the notifications or even stop them until the score comes back to a healthier range. [\\\\[Read in Detail\\\\]](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/epns-protocol/channels/spam-rating-and-throttling)\\n\\n## Governance\\n\\nThe protocol governance is designed to incentivize continued adoption of the EPNS protocol. This is achieved by ensuring incentives for all the users involved by rewarding or encouraging them through incentives and penalty, their continued involvement is seen to be necessary for the growth and adoption of the protocol and to achieve the **vision of becoming a web3 notification standard**. The EPNS user are categorized as **Service Providers, Subscribers, Wallet / Infra Services, and Governance Users**, all of them are rewarded for their involvement and to ensure that they keep other parties in check for a healthy ecosystem according to the game theory described in the whitepaper. [**\\\\[**Read in Detail**\\\\]**](https://whitepaper.epns.io/governance-section/governance/game-theory)\\n\\n# **EPNS Product**\\n\\nIn order to facilitate the adoption of the protocol and to provide value to services, we are also building a product suite of EPNS to catalyze the adoption and growth. These currently include developing:\\n\\n- **EPNS Mobile App** \u2014 Serves the purpose of delivering notifications from decentralized protocol to centralized EPNS Infra to centralized platforms (iOS and Android).\\n- **dApp** \u2014 Enables receiving notifications from web browsers and also enables delivery of notifications from protocol to decentralized carriers.\\n- **EPNS Infra (Push Service)** \u2014 Enables carrying notifications from decentralized protocol to centralized solutions (iOS, Android, Web, etc). Also enables third-party dApps, services, and protocols to start experiencing the notification impact as notifications are delivered following the entire protocol/product lifecycle.\\n- **Showrunners** -These are channels created and run by us for the benefit of the community and for users to come and see why push notifications transformed the traditional world. Few examples of showrunners which we will be running are -: Compound liquidation alert, Wallet crypto movement tracker, Eth Gas alerter, ENS domain expiry, etc.\\n- **JS Library** \u2014 Considerably reduces the integration time required for third party dApps, servers. We see these products to enable instant value add to the protocol and help in increasing awareness and eventually drive the adoption of the protocol.\\n- **Future Features \u2014** There are some future features including decentralized video that is getting discussed and explored as well, you can read a brief synopsis of them over here. [**\\\\[**Read in Detail**\\\\]**](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/future-features-research)\\n\\n# **Governance**\\n\\nThe native digital cryptographically - secured utility token of the EPNS protocol (**$PUSH**) is a transferable representation of attributed functions specified in the protocol/code of the EPNS protocol, which is designed to play a major role in the functioning of the ecosystem on the EPNS protocol and intended to be used solely as the primary utility token on the network.\\n\\n**$PUSH** tokens are used to control various core functionalities of the EPNS protocol, allowing users to vote on features of the protocol. For the avoidance of doubt, the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of the EPNS protocol; the right to vote does not entitle $PUSH holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, the Distributor or their respective affiliates, or their assets, and does not constitute any equity interest in any of the aforementioned entities. For example, the protocol fees are charged in **$ETH** or **$DAI** within the EPNS protocol, but the $PUSH token holders may vote to change these fee parameters.

So put on your detective hat, channel your inner Sherlock and head on over to 221B Baker Street as we take a deep dive into\u2026**HARVEST Finance.**\\n\\n### **HARVEST FINANCE**\\n\\nHarvest Finance, similar to [Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance), is a DeFi yield aggregator. A yield aggregator is basically a platform that implements investment strategies on different DeFi Projects in order to maximize yields. Dubbed to be Yearn\u2019s competitor in the field, Harvest, within a fortnight of its launch grew among the ranks in DeFi to gain $1billion in total value locked (TVL). This is despite early warnings in their audit reports as well as concerns of centralization surrounding the project.\\n\\n# **What happened?**\\n\\nOn October 26, 02:53:31 AM +UTC, an anonymous attacker executed the theft of funds from the USDC and USDT vaults of Harvest Finance. The heist resulted in $24 million worth of funds being stolen out of which $2.5 million was sent back, these returned funds will be distributed among those who lost funds in this exploit.\\n\\nThe Harvest team has been trying to mitigate the effects of this exploit which occurred due to what they call their \u201cengineering error\u201d. As the story unfolds while this article is being written, Harvest is continuously tracking the funds that were stolen and have claimed to have identified the attacker and has been requesting the attacker to return the funds back to its rightful owners and is also offering a bounty of $400k (bounced up from $100k) to anyone who is able to persuade the attacker to return the funds.\\n\\nHarvest Finance acted and withdrew all the funds from the shared pools immediately after evaluating the attack and reconstructing its process. This includes DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD as well as WBTC and renBTC. The funds are currently present in the vaults and cannot suffer from further market manipulation. The attack did not involve DAI, TUSD, WBTC, and renBTC, and the depositors in these vaults were not affected.\\n\\nThe addresses used for carrying out the heist has been requested to be blacklisted. With the Harvest team not ready to dox the attacker even after their claim that they have identified the attacker and that the attacker is \u201cwell known in the crypto community\u201d, there has been speculation that either the Harvest team has been bluffing all along about the identity of the attacker or they are carrying out an inside job.\\n\\n# **How did it happen?**\\n\\nWith the release of the O[fficial post mortem report](https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217) of Harvest Finance released by the team itself, we get to see the exact steps in how the attacker managed to pull off such a heist. The entire attack took place with the help of Flash loans and a well-planned arbitrage attack.\\n\\nThe exploits were a series of arbitrage trades between Uniswap, Curve Finance, and Harvest Finance, and the funds were then cashed out via renBTC and Tornado.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/devops199fan/status/1320579856938119168&amp;image=\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"795\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"\\" class=\\"eo n ff dy bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\n\\nThe attacker began taking out flash loans of $50 million worth USDC on Uniswap and used it to swap between the USDC/USDT pool in Harvest to manipulate the market price wildly. The discounted stablecoins were then used to pay back the flash loan, and each successful swap was then converted into ETH and then to renBTC and eventually to BTC.\\n\\nThere is still a widespread debate on whether or not this attack was \u201cillegal\u201d since the attacker basically just used trade arbitrage \u2014 a common profit-making technique \u2014 on a much larger scale with huge amounts of funds which enormously fluctuated the market. One side considers this as the wits of a smart person who used the poor smart contract design to their advantage, whereas the other side of the community vouches that purposely fluctuating a market at such scales to gain massive amounts of profits while leaving the others in the dust is not acceptable and the attacker must be held accountable.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/bneiluj/status/1320686478486347778&amp;image=\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"787\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"\\" class=\\"eo n ff dy bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\n\\n# **Why did it happen**\\n\\nOne of the major reasons this attack happened was because of a single design flaw in Harvest Finance\u2019s smart contract design.\\n\\nAccording to @PancakeBunnyFin\u2019s analysis and also as confirmed by the Harvest Finance team, the loose smart contract design by Harvest is what cost them $24 million.

With most of the Defi applications being built on top of Ethereum, it has become one of the leading platforms to lead the next step to the evolution of Financial Technology since the release of Bitcoin 11 years ago.\\n\\nAlthough the DeFi space has been expanding, we can already see the difficulties faced by the average Defi user and even serious Yield Farmers, when it comes to keeping track of what is going on and being able to get real-time alerts and information when important events go down.\\n\\nThis article will show how Decentralized Notifications can enhance the overall DeFi experience. It is said that _sometimes you don\u2019t know you need something until you actually get it._\\n\\nTo show you what we mean, here are 13 DeFi Notifications Ethereum needs today:\\n\\n# **1\\\\. Lottery win on PoolTogether:**\\n\\n[PoolTogether is a no-loss Defi Savings Lottery](https://www.pooltogether.com), which allows users to win a prize every week. Currently, there is no way to know if you\u2019ve won the lottery for that week until you log in to the dApp again.\\n\\nNotifications can alert you if you win the lottery right when it is announced and you can unleash your inner Uncle Scrooge and dive right into your riches!\\n\\n# **2\\\\. C-Ratio and Liquidation Penalty**\\n\\nC-ratio or Collateralization Ratio is the ratio between your collateral assets compared to any open loans you have against them. In DeFi, collateralized loans are the backbone of open lending protocols.\\n\\nThere is a liquidation penalty that applies to you when you take a loan, and if your c-ratio drops lower than the allowed ratio, then your asset will be liquidated. In order to avoid this, as a user, you would also want to be notified when your c-ratio starts to drop significantly so that you can avoid liquidation.\\n\\nRecently, [Synthetix.io](https://www.synthetix.io) had changed its liquidation penalty to below 200% c-ratio. This means that if you stake on synthetix.io and your c-ratio drops below 200% then you will be liquidated.\\n\\nThis is crucial information that needs to be known to anyone who stakes on any protocol and not only Synthetix. One cannot expect a user who stakes to keep checking your site for updates on crucial things such as this. Notifications can help solve this by notifying stakers as and when something like this happens.\\n\\n# **3\\\\. Boosts and Repays CDP from DefiSaver**\\n\\nCDP stands for Collateralized Debt Position. In layman\u2019s terms, it\u2019s when you put up assets as collateral in order to take out a loan or debt against said collateral.\\n\\nWith [DefiSaver](https://defisaver.com) you are able to Boost or Repay your CDP either in the Standard way or by Flash Loans. Flash Loans allow the provision of a 1-transaction CDP settlement.\\n\\n![Cover Image of 13 DeFi Notifications Ethereum Needs Today](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nIf you choose to repay or boost your CDP, you would want to get notified when the transaction has been done, and to let you know what your CDP position is at. Notifications can be crucial to let you know.\\n\\n# **4\\\\. When Yearn Finance lists a new yVault**\\n\\nVaults employ strategies to automate the best yield farming opportunities available.\\n\\nThey were designed so that the community could work together to build new strategies to find the best yield. Currently, all vaults are made by the original creator of the yearn.finance, but in the future users will be able to submit their own strategies to compete who can come up with the best one.\\n\\nIf you are interested in increasing your yield and want to keep track of the new vaults that are listed on [Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance), then notifications can help you to do so. This allows you to be up to date on what are the available options to you and make decisions on where you want to stake your assets.\\n\\nYearn Finance even recently started a weekly series on Medium called Yearn State of the Vaults \u2014 a weekly update that will include yVault-related updates from the previous week as well as more in-depth information about Yearn\u2019s yVaults such as current vault strategies, etc.\\n\\nBy pushing updates such as Weekly APY, Current Vault Strategies, etc through decentralized notifications, Yearn can make sure that all their users \u201cstay in the game\u201d.\\n\\n# **5\\\\. When LoopRing lists a new Trading Pair**\\n\\n[Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/) is an Ethereum based decentralized exchange protocol that is being created to allow users to exchange assets across various exchanges. It allows anyone to build high-throughput, non-custodial, order book-based exchanges on Ethereum by leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs.\\n\\nCurrently, LoopRing announces new trading pairs on [Medium](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-dex-added-usdt-trading-pairs-batch-5-b7cbdab6bd84). This is obviously not an efficient way to convey information. Wouldn\u2019t it be much more convenient for you to get notifications when new trading pairs are listed instead? Exactly.\\n\\n# **6\\\\. $MEME NFT: Your Daily Pineapples** \ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf4d\\n\\n[$MEME](http://dontbuymeme.com/) is an experimental protocol mashing up some of the most exciting innovations in DeFi and crypto collectibles. Meme enables you to stake tokens to farm limited edition NFTs, bringing accessible DeFi to the community.\\n\\nYou are allowed to stake anywhere from 1\u20135 MEME tokens and you receive a proportional amount of Pineapples every day. (If you stake 1 MEME, then you receive 1 Pineapple per day. But if you stake 5 MEME then you receive 5 Pineapple per day).\\n\\n![Cover Image of 13 DeFi Notifications Ethereum Needs Today](./image-2.gif)\\n\\nDon\u2019t Buy MEME\\n\\nWith decentralized notifications, you can be notified when the Pineapple you deserve to get has been credited to your wallet!\\n\\n# **7\\\\. $MEME NFT: When you have enough Pineapple to buy an NFT**\\n\\nContinuing from the above point, when you have a certain amount of Pineapple with you minted from the daily rewards, then you will be able to buy an NFT. The price can vary based on the type of NFTs offered, (Relic, Common, Rare, Legendary).ranging from 1 PNPL for a Relic NFT to 75 PNPL to be able to claim a Legendary NFT.\\n\\nWith notifications, you can be alerted when you are eligible to buy the different types of NFTs at their price points. This can also be extended to notify when new artists join the protocol and list a new pool to create new crypto collectibles and thus add excitement and hype. For example,\\n\\n> **_\u201cARIST DROP 0 \u2014 SVEN: The Meme team is proud to announce our first exclusive digital artist drop with Sven Eberwein. Earn enough PNPL, to mint a brand-new, exclusive MEME x SVEN crypto collectible.\u201d_**\\n\\n# **8\\\\. Uniswap adds a new token list**\\n\\n[Uniswap is a Decentralised Exchange Platform](https://uniswap.org) built on top of Ethereum. It automates liquidity and allows you to swap between different ERC20 tokens. Token lists on Uniswap are essentially just lists provided by different projects containing different ERC20 tokens whose reputation is backed by the reputation of the project that lists them. This is done to minimize and differentiate between high quality and legitimate ERC20 tokens from scams that have become a problem with the rise in popularity of Defi.\\n\\nWith the help of notifications, you can be alerted when a new token list is added to Uniswap hence allowing the user to check it out and see if there are any tokens in that list that might catch their attention to invest in.\\n\\n# **9\\\\. Voting Period for On-Chain Governance**\\n\\nAs described in our [On-Chain Governance article](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/how-decentralised-notifications-can-revolutionize-on-chain-governance-part-i-ff09e7465279), governance is an aspect that immediately requires the use of notifications.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1303343878263595013&amp;image=\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"513\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"\\" class=\\"eo n ff dy bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\n\\nOn-chain governance powered by EPNS\\n\\nIf you run a Defi-based service, what if your service has an On-Chain Governance model and you wanted to inform users to vote on a really important or critical and emergency proposal that could decide the future of the protocol in the near future? What if your protocol was about to be compromised because of a bug and wanted to reach out to as much as your User base as you possibly can to reach quorum as soon as possible to vote on the bug-fix proposal? Or you want some way to know the general preferences of your token holders by \u2018Signalling\u2019 before actually making the users vote in order to ensure a fork doesn\u2019t occur?\\n\\nDecentralized Notifications are crucial in this context, and it shows why protocols must choose more efficient communication mediums for Governance related matters than what they have now (Twitter, Medium, Telegram, etc.)\\n\\n# **10\\\\. DEX Limit Orders**\\n\\nWhen you buy or sell a token on a DEX, you have two main ways to determine the price you\u2019ll trade at, these are the market order and the limit order. With market orders, you trade the token for whatever the current market price is. With limit orders, you can list your preferred price, and if the token hits it the trade is usually executed.\\n\\nWith notifications, you can immediately get notified when and if the trade has been executed, if you\u2019ve listed your price as a limit order. This ensures that you don\u2019t have to keep checking your wallet to see if a transaction has gone through.\\n\\n# **11\\\\. Gas Price Tracker**\\n\\nOne of the major concerns that plague Ethereum today is its arbitrarily high gas costs. Sometimes these gases can go through the roof and makes it completely undesirable to trade or exchange on the platform during these peaks. As a DeFi enthusiast, you would want to know when the Gas is high and when is it low. This would allow you to make decisions to transfer and send funds, etc all the while maximizing your returns. With decentralized notifications from EPNS, this is totally possible, and you will be notified when the GAS is peaking and when it is not, hence giving you the power to make decisions on what to do with your assets.\\n\\nAlso, look out for the Gas price tracker channel by EPNS coming soon!!\\n\\n# **12\\\\. Exit Game on Layer 2**\\n\\nThere are currently Layer 2 protocols built on top of Ethereum to facilitate scalability and faster throughput on the chain. Some layer 2 solutions for example, basically function on the notion that within a certain time frame any transaction on the layer 2 protocol is true until proven otherwise by a validator. But these transactions are not stored on the main Ethereum mainnet during this validation period yet. And only after this time frame does the whole bunch of transactions be sent over to the mainnet and stored on the blockchain indefinitely, this is called the end game or the exit game of layer 2.\\n\\nThe idea behind this being, DeFi protocols can make use of this layer 2 functionality to increase their throughput and thus enhance scalability. But the time frame between the exit games of such layer 2 solutions often take several days, and could probably go up to a week.\\n\\nWith the help of notifications, one may be notified when the exit game has been executed successfully in order to finally confirm their transactions on-chain.\\n\\n# **13\\\\. Prevention of Rug Pulls in AMMs**\\n\\nRug Pulls or exit scams are one of the biggest issues in Defi today. There are a lot of people preying on unsuspecting newbie crypto enthusiasts all the while promising them great ROIs, and then draining the liquidity pool when the \u201charvest is ripe\u201d and when the other Liquidity Providers least expect it.\\n\\nOne novel solution implemented by [BUILD Finance](https://letsbuild.finance) for this was that there could be a 2 day grace period from the time of minting until the tokens enter the AMM (Automated Market Maker). Subsequently, when the tokens are minted, the LPs (Liquidity Providers) are notified via decentralized notifications like EPNS. Hence disincentivizing rug-pulls since the LPs can dump their tokens if they see an exit scam going on right under their nose!\\n\\nThe need for notifications can be applied to many different areas and in with much utility that one may not be able to imagine. The above utilities of notifications in DeFi are just the beginning. With the rapid pace at which the DeFi space is expanding, it is going to be much more important for notifications to help users keep track of everything going on. EPNS does just that and allows you to receive notifications in the most decentralized way possible, abiding by everything DeFi stands for.\\n\\n# **Decentralized Notifications with EPNS**\\n\\n**EPNS (Ethereum Push Notification Service)** is a decentralized notification protocol that enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications. Using the protocol, any dApp, service or smart contract can send notifications to users in a platform-agnostic fashion (mobile, tablet, web, user wallets, etc). The DeFi aspect of the protocol ensures that the user receives notifications and also earns from them.\\n\\nWith EPNS, we can be assured that sooner than later Defi will receive the notifications that it absolutely needs.\\n\\nEPNS is the hero we need and deserve in DeFi.\\n\\nReferences: [Market Order vs Limit Order](https://cryptortrust.com/2020/09/08/trading-token-market-order-vs-limit-order/#:~:text=Market%20orders%20allow%20you%20to,order%20and%20the%20limit%20order.) | [Loopring Review](https://www.coinbureau.com/review/loopring-lrc/) | [Yearn Vaults](https://docs.yearn.finance/faq#vaults) | [CDP Defi Saver](https://medium.com/defi-saver/introducing-1-transaction-cdp-closing-powered-by-flash-loans-8a83456226f4) | [Collateralized Loans](https://defirate.com/collateralized-loan/) | [PoolTogether](https://www.argent.xyz/blog/how-to-use-pooltogether/)\\n\\nBecome part of our buzzing community!

We went from the simple Pong, Pacman, and Mario in the arcades in the 70s and 80s to games like Snake which could be played on Mobiles in the 1990s, and then eventually to consoles and PCs with classics like the Legend of Zelda, and so on (If I have hit you with the nostalgia, don\u2019t forget to clap this article :) ).\\n\\nEven if you were someone playing in the early 2000s we saw the boom of MMORPGs like Runescape, League of Legends, World of Warcraft, and my personal favorite Club Penguin (where\u2019s my penguin gang at ;) ). With mainstream consoles like Xbox and Playstation taking over the market in the past decade, we started to see a huge arsenal of high-end games and game developers. There are now mainstream Esports competitions and World Championships played with national stakes, and huge communities formed on live-streaming platforms like Twitch which show us how huge this industry has grown!\\n\\nAs of mid-2020, the global gaming sector is set to exceed $150 billion, and it looks like it is just going to keep growing.\\n\\nEven emerging technologies like AI has tried its hand in video games with big players like Elon Musk\u2019s OpenAI challenging World Champions to DOTA 2 and beating them 2\u20130!\\n\\nSimilarly, it is inevitable for gaming to cross paths with another emerging technology. **Blockchain.**\\n\\n# Blockchain and Crypto Gaming\\n\\nIn the past few years, Crypto Gaming has been picking up quite a lot of steam. With the combination of NFTs (a unique token that represents an asset) and some solid gameplay, crypto gaming is turning out to be one of those spaces which will influence the mainstream adoption of Web3.0.\\n\\n[Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co) is one of the first applications of gaming in blockchain. It became so popular that it caused network congestion in Ethereum in 2017. Games like Cryptokitties turned out to be super profitable, with one player even earning almost $700K on trading Cryptokitties.\\n\\nNow with more games ([Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com), [MyCryptoHeroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net), [Neon District](https://neondistrict.io), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org), etc.) being built on the blockchain by game development companies like [Outplay Games](https://outplay.games) (huge shoutout to [Paul Gadi](https://twitter.com/polats)), [Blockade Games](https://blockade.games), and others, we hope to see much more growth and variety in Blockchain gaming which as mentioned earlier can help in the mainstream adoption of blockchain.\\n\\nBut gaming on the blockchain has its drawbacks, and one of the most major pain points is **User Experience**. To expect mainstream adoption we must adhere to user expectations about the UX of the game, and this relates to both in-game and off-game experience. Below use cases explain how\\n\\n> EPNS AOE (Area of effect) can enhance User Experience, to encourage adoption of blockchain games, and to ensure retention rates effectively.\\n\\n## 1\\\\. Trading and Auctions of NFTs in a Marketplace\\n\\nAuctions and trading are some of the most important features when it comes to crypto gaming. You may be someone who has set up a marketplace and you want to know when something in your market place just got sold, currently, you are either being sent an email when this happens or you just have to log in to your marketplace and check for yourself. Imagine if you didn\u2019t have to do that; imagine if the news comes directly to you from your marketplace as a push notification.\\n\\nPush Notifications allow marketplace owners to notify frequent customers on Massive Sales and offer campaigns that are being held on the platform, and also allows Marketplace owners to recommend similar products to that bought by their customers to increase retention rate, it\u2019s a whole new paradigm of marketing in Marketplaces that have been missing for so long!\\n\\nIf you think about it, push notifications opens up a whole new dimension of user experience for the customer as well, and not just the marketplace owner. \u201cHow?\u201d you ask? Well, aside from getting notified directly on your device when your transaction goes through and is confirmed when you buy a product in the marketplace (a feature still missing in almost all Web3.0 based services), you are also able to actively participate in a marketplace auction!\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=twitter&amp;url=https%3A//twitter.com/memedefi/status/1315498046164271105&amp;image=\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" height=\\"393\\" width=\\"680\\" title=\\"\\" class=\\"eo n ff dy bg\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>\\n\\nCurrently, in Web3.0 marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io), they advise you to pay close attention to the items you bid on throughout the duration of the auction which could span for 3\u20134 days. In other words, they expect you to keep visiting continuously to make sure you aren\u2019t outbid by someone else! Imagine doing this for 3\u20134 days, sounds tedious, isn\u2019t it? Luckily with EPNS, you can potentially receive notifications if anyone has outbid you in that auction. This is game-changing and revolutionary in Web3.0! Now you can keep tabs on whatever you bid and be reminded when someone tries to beat you or if the deadline of an auction is near or just to let you know that you won the auction. These are not simply just features a marketplace should have but necessities that one expects from Web3.0 and EPNS provides it.\\n\\n_More on NFT\u2019s coming soon \u2026(stay tuned)_\\n\\n## 2\\\\. Announce exclusive In-Game Assets\\n\\nMarketplaces as explored above are not exactly gaming in blockchain but an essential part. Notifications are still missing even in in-game features. Have you noticed that when you play traditional mobile games these days that you get notifications? Maybe there is a new Season, a new campaign, new characters, and weapons, or even new storylines you want players to check out. But this is missing currently in the arena of Blockchain Games.\\n\\nMaybe your game just dropped a rare item on the map which is up for grabs in a limited time treasure hunt! This would be a great opportunity to bring in as many users in your player base to start playing!\\n\\nSending out notifications for these events creates anticipation and excitement, making players want to check out these new features or try their hand in the new challenges that have never been seen before.\\n\\n## 3\\\\. Personalized Gaming\\n\\nNudging players a little with a message like **\u201c_Oh Chosen one, it has been a while since you have visited us. Come back where you left off and lead our clan to victory_**\u201d or an **\u201c_ALERT \u2014 You have been attacked by LordMaster6565, we need to take Revenge_\u201d** will go a long way as game developers are able to ensure that they personalize and add a bit of flare in the gaming experience and push them enough to return to the game.\\n\\nIf this was not enough, sending out notifications to create a sense of competition among friends like, **_\u201c Your friend Kobe just reached Level 50! Start playing in order to keep up!_**\u201d or just applauding some achievements or milestones reached by the player can be celebrated with notifications like **_\u201cYou just won 5 Duels in a row! Continue playing to keep the streak going!\u201d_** can increase player return rates and enhance the overall experience both in-game and off-game.\\n\\n## 4\\\\. Waiting time\\n\\nSome games as you know, have waiting times where your gameplay may not move forward. This waiting time may come as some sort of Energy Refill to play matches again or as Breeding Times. Often these waiting times start off as 5 mins, and then as you level up or the rarer the item, the waiting time increases, and sometimes may take several hours. And as a game developer, these are hours your players are not in your game but are outside it doing their daily activities, and you need them to return to your game as soon as the waiting period ends. This is where notifications can help you as well. For example, **_\u201cYour Rocket Fuel has been replenished! Log back in and resume defeating galactic baddies from conquering the universe!\u201d_**\\n\\nThis even holds true for idle games where you grow your own farm or city or metropolis or pet! You may have assigned your Sims to do a task in order to complete a quest, but it sadly takes 2 hours to complete. What now? From the POV of a game developer, I want my player to return to the game as soon as this task is done so that they keep playing on my platform, so what do I do? I send a notification, as simple as that!\\n\\n## 5\\\\. Multiplayer Invites\\n\\nBlockchain games fundamentally are Multiplayer games, this means that it is not only you playing the game, hence there arises a high probability that you\u2019ve made friends along the way or you already have friends who play the game with you. One way EPNS can completely change the Crypto Gaming industry is with the functionality of an Invite.\\n\\nSuppose, you\u2019re playing a game, let\u2019s take for example a really popular game, Ludo King (but is not a Blockchain game. Let\u2019s just assume that it is for the sake of getting the point across.)\\n\\nSo in a game like Ludo King, a player is able to create Private Rooms after which they can invite their friends to join that room. Imagine you just created such a room and you\u2019re swiping through your in-game friends\u2019 list, and you tap the Invite button to invite them to that room, and that friend receives notification immediately with a CTA (Call-to-Action) that redirects them to the game and lets them join the room! All in the tap of a finger!\\n\\nImagine in a blockchain game such as Gods Unchained, where you get to have duels, and matches with your friends, what if you could just tap a button and the game sends out a clickable dynamic notification to that person?\\n\\nThis novel aspect provides an untapped potential of notifications that we haven\u2019t seen anywhere in Web3.0 games and will change how games are built from here on out in Blockchain!\\n\\n# Gaming For The Win\\n\\nGaming has always been an industry that has had multitudes of people in its community. Gaming can be anything from a pastime to passion for different individuals but it is true that it unites everyone. With Blockchain & Crypto Gaming in the market we are yet to see but hopeful for mainstream adoption, which will only happen if we provide a better user as well as gaming experience in-game and off-game. EPNS believes that one of the ways we can inch towards creating a wholesome gaming experience and achieving mainstream adoption would be the use of Push Notifications by developers in new and creative ways.\\n\\n> The possibilities of Push Notifications are endless because it allows access to one of the most invaluable things that almost all platforms want of yours. **Attention.**\\n\\nPush Notifications in gaming has changed the way people game in the traditional gaming world, let\u2019s bring that magic into the Web3.0 world and more.\\n\\nCheers & GL HF!!\\n\\nBecome part of our buzzing community!

You can check out Part 1_ [_here_](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/how-decentralised-notifications-can-revolutionize-on-chain-governance-part-i-ff09e7465279)_._\\n\\nIn the [previous article](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/how-decentralised-notifications-can-revolutionize-on-chain-governance-part-i-ff09e7465279), we explored the various problems faced by On-Chain Governance and the issues that arise due to a lack of standardized communication medium by Web3 protocols to communicate with their stakeholders with the help of YAM as an example. Low-voter turnout and voter apathy could be tracked to the poor user experience as well as lack of subject matter expertise when it comes to the majority of stakeholders which ultimately leads to the undistributed voter turnout in On-Chain Governance. We saw ultimately saw how [EPNS](https://epns.io) as a platform could help reduce voter apathy and eventually increase voter turnout.\\n\\nWhat we will be discussing here today in Part 2 of this series will be a different aspect of on-chain governance to streamline efficient decision making and efficient protocol upgrades. One which could very likely make sure that everyone in the network is on the same page.\\n\\nThis is where **Game Theory & Governance** join hands and provide us with a way to analyze user sentiments and predict human reasoning in order to facilitate a decision better on-chain.\\n\\n## TL;DR Key Points:\\n\\n> 1. In Blockchain, upgrading the system or various protocols and policies is often a coordination game.\\n>\\n> 2)A governance system in Blockchain can help facilitate the coordination of the community on an equilibrium that everyone can accept. It acts as a focal point (Signal). It doesn\u2019t enforce a decision on the system, instead, it guides the stakeholders of the system to a coordinated choice.\\n>\\n> 3. Right now, the overwhelming majority of the governance of decentralized systems such as measuring community sentiment and user intentions is mostly done on Web 2.0 platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, Github and forums \u2014 centralized platforms that are susceptible to various forms of opaque attack and bias.\\n>\\n> 4)**EPNS** can act as a focal point for governance decisions as services are able to broadcast messages and signals to the public.\\n\\n# **Game Theory and Focal Points in Governance**\\n\\nGame theory is the study of rational behaviour in situations involving interdependence. The goal of game theory for cryptocurrency and Blockchain systems is to build networks that need no oversight by modelling and predicting human reasoning and yet have positive outcomes for the greater good. In Blockchain, upgrading the system or various protocols and policies is often a coordination game. Coordination games are strategic games with multiple [**_Nash equilibria_**](https://medium.com/@robin.rrt123/blockchain-governance-game-theory-2bd28e6513e3)**_._**\\n\\nThe 3 possibilities for a **blockchain policy upgrade** are:\\n\\n> _1\\\\. The entire chain stays with the current status quo_\\n>\\n> _2\\\\. The entire chain can upgrade to the new policy_\\n>\\n> _3\\\\. There can be a hard fork, wherein a considerable amount of stakeholders want to change to the new policy whereas the rest desire to continue with the status quo, and hence both the old and new chains co-exist simultaneously. (Coordination Failure)_\\n\\nBlockchain communities can prevent coordination failures by introducing **focal points**.\\n\\nA _focal point_ is a public signal that all participants in the blockchain system can understand. It indicates to everyone which Nash equilibrium they should choose. A focal point can be anything \u2014 a sign, a signal, anything that increases the chance that all players coordinate on the same equilibrium.\\n\\nWith the help of a common and unified communication medium for the entire user base where the chain or protocol developers are able to _directly communicate_ with users who have a right to vote in governance-related matters by virtue of holding the tokens to that network. The developers are able to provide timely updates for the dedicated user base as well as provide focal points to the community and guide them to make an informed decision.\\n\\nA **governance system in Blockchain** can help facilitate the coordination of the community on an equilibrium that everyone can accept.\\n\\nFor example, a majority rule governance system could help the community coordinate to one chain. If a 55% vote is in favour of the change, it would indicate to everyone or a majority of the users will move to or will be using the upgraded chain, therefore the individuals could be better off using the upgraded chain and the vice versa is also true for rejecting the upgradation proposal and staying in the status quo (**_Network Effects_**).\\n\\nIn this, a governance system acts as a focal point. It doesn\u2019t enforce a decision on the system, instead, it guides the stakeholders of the system to a coordinated choice. As per the above example, the chain developers could probably send a broadcast message to wallet addresses that hold the tokens to a protocol which gives a call to action to take a poll and then broadcast the results back to the users to allow them to have a general idea on how the final vote will turn out to be as well as show the pros and cons to a proposal.\\n\\nThis concept of focal points can be achieved with the help of \u201cSignals\u201d. Signals are indicators used by users or stakeholders of that blockchain network to indicate their preference regarding a particular governance-related decision, which is, in-turn, non-binding and also one which doesn\u2019t cost the stakeholder as well.\\n\\nAn example of this type of signalling could be that of Carbon Votes on the Ethereum Platform. \u201cCarbon Vote was initiated during the DAO hard fork and conducted vote in a secure web-page fashion with the feature that the voting conducted did not require coins to leave voters\u2019 wallets. It had been a great source of reference when the community decided to go with the fork.\u201d\\n\\nCarbon Vote acted as a signalling device, where stakeholders of the Ethereum protocol could send a 0 ETH transaction to either a **YES** or **NO** address, during a specific voting period, after which the tally is calculated by looking at the stake of each voter who voted their preference.\\n\\nWith the help of Carbon Vote as a focal point, stakeholders of Ethereum were able to make decisions on whether to fork or not, after the DAO incident.\\n\\n# **EPNS: A Focal Point for the future?**\\n\\nEPNS aims to be a platform-agnostic decentralized notification system. It provides a uniform and standardized way for Web3 services to communicate seamlessly with their users. As Phil Lucsok from Polkadot says in his [article](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/why-on-chain-governance-82ecf28f314c), that right now, the overwhelming majority of the governance of decentralized systems such as measuring community sentiment and user intentions is mostly done on Web 2.0 platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, Github and forums \u2014 centralized platforms that are susceptible to various forms of opaque attack and bias. In simple words, **Web 3.0 shouldn\u2019t be governed using Web 2.0 platforms.**\\n\\nEPNS can act as a focal point for governance decisions as protocols are able to broadcast messages and signals to the public. Let\u2019s imagine a chain such as Tezos using this protocol.\\n\\nTezos is popular for its completely on-chain governance model. Their motto is \u201ca truly leaderless, smart contract platform\u201d. Their governance model design allows all users to vote on everything including chain rewrites. The interesting thing about this project is that it has a cyclical voting system in place \u2014 one for each quarter of the year. With each cycle having its individual use case \u2014 the first cycle for proposal consideration, the second deals with actual voting and the third is for testing and live update. The third stage has a specified threshold or majority required in order for the proposed changes to be deployed on the Tezos mainnet.\\n\\nNow, **_what could a chain like Tezos gain from a protocol like EPNS?_**\\n\\nWhat we will focus here will be the second cycle \u2014 the voting. Tezos could activate themselves as a Channel on the EPNS protocol, and then during the voting period, the Tezos channel could broadcast a message to all the subscribers(wallet addresses) of the channel which guides them to a dedicated voting platform where users can indicate their preferences about the proposal before the actual voting takes place (signalling in a sense), during this phase, the channel can broadcast hourly voting trackers. In this way, the users will stay updated on how the vote is proceeding and also be able to change their decision if they would like to due to Network Effects.\\n\\nThe Channel, in this way, can act as a focal point and provide an idea to all stakeholders about the possible outcome of the actual voting when it occurs. This will allow the facilitation of educated decision making when it comes to the actual voting. As explained earlier, using **such a system doesn\u2019t enforce a decision on the system, instead, it guides the stakeholders of the system to a coordinated choice.**\\n\\n# **Conclusion**\\n\\nIn Blockchain, upgrading the system or various protocols and policies is often a coordination game. Often, achieving this coordination to make unanimous collective decisions is not as easy as it sounds. With the help of Game Theory and the concept of Focal points, one can try to facilitate decision making by using Signals to indicate stakeholder preferences.\\n\\nOn-Chain governance often suffers from voter apathy and low voter turnout, which usually leads to a more centralized decision-making process to an otherwise decentralized protocol. In order to increase decentralization when it comes to on-chain voting, the use of a platform such as EPNS as a possible tool for creating focal points can come in handy.\\n\\nIf you like what EPNS is attempting to do by shaking the very foundations of blockchain & decentralized communication, and you would like to follow our journey\u2026\\n\\n_Consider joining our buzzing Social Media Community!_\\n\\n> _Telegram:_ [_https://t.me/epnsproject_](https://t.me/epnsproject)\\n>\\n> _Twitter:_ [_https://twitter.com/epnsproject_](https://twitter.com/epnsproject)\\n>\\n> _Github:_ [_https://github.com/push-protocol_](https://github.com/push-protocol)\\n\\n_References:_ [_Blockchain Governance & Game Theory_](https://medium.com/@robin.rrt123/blockchain-governance-game-theory-2bd28e6513e3) _\u2014 Robin Roy |_ [_Why On-Chain Governance?_](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/why-on-chain-governance-82ecf28f314c) _\u2014 Phil Lucsok |_ [_Voting vs Signaling_](https://medium.com/strongblock-consulting/voting-vs-signaling-in-blockchain-governance-24ddacdaab9d) _\u2014 Thomas Cox_"},{"id":"epns-awarded-aave-grant","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-awarded-aave-grant","source":"@site/blog/2020-09-14-epns-award3d-aave-grant/index.md","title":"EPNS awarded AAVE grant !!","description":"EPNS awarded AAVE grant !!","date":"2020-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 14, 2020","tags":[{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Decentralization","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/decentralization"},{"label":"Push Notification","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/push-notification"},{"label":"Governance","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/governance"},{"label":"Blog","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":0.6033333333333334,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-awarded-aave-grant","title":"EPNS awarded AAVE grant !!","description":"EPNS awarded AAVE grant !!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"We\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019ve been awarded a grant by  Aavesome.

But for those who don\u2019t here is a quick run-through.\\n\\n\u201cYam is an experimental protocol mashing up some of the most exciting innovations in programmable money and governance. Built by a team of DeFi natives\u201d, it features a fully on-chain governance model to enable decentralized control and evolution from Day 1.\\n\\nBut at 08:01 AM UTC, Aug 13, 2020, the creator of [YAM](https://yam.finance/), tweeted about the failure of rescuing the $750,000 yCRV tokens locked in the governance contract because of a bug in the protocol. YAM was never professionally audited before release, which led to the discovery of the bug after deployment. Hours before that tweet, people in the Ethereum community advocated for a bug-fix-proposal which could have had the chance to **SAVE YAM!**\\n\\nInterestingly, both the YAM protocol was deployed and the SAVE YAM campaign was both done via a Medium blog post. Although the campaign gained a lot of traction in the Defi community, the rise and fall of YAM have quickly become a cautionary tale within the same community. Here, what we find intriguing (but is common in most blockchain projects) and would like to focus today, is the medium of communication that the YAM developers decided to use when initiating this critical SAVE YAM campaign \u2014 Medium (pun totally intended!).\\n\\nIt just seems odd that such a critical announcement that could decide the fate of the protocol was posted on a blog site and a social networking site like Twitter, where stakeholders of the protocol could very much miss if they didn\u2019t pay attention to the series of events that unfolded a few days after the protocol was deployed. This limitation of communication with stakeholders primarily especially when related to on-chain governance is not only restricted to YAM but applies commonly to the whole Blockchain and Web3 based Decentralized community! Protocols and chains often rely on informal social media networking sites such as Twitter, Reddit and Medium to reach their audience, but who accounts for users of the protocol who may want to vote but cannot, just because they missed that tweet? Another issue to point out is also that decentralized Web3.0 protocols currently make use of centralized domains to reach their user base.\\n\\nIt is high time for a reliable and standardized mode of communication to be established between users of a protocol. In this article, we will define what on-chain governance is as well as explain why a standard and unified communication medium between a decentralized protocol or service and their respective user base is needed and how one may go about establishing one. Before diving deeper into this rabbit hole, let\u2019s explain what on-chain governance is.\\n\\n# Off-chain & On-Chain Governance\\n\\nGovernance in the context of blockchain is a means to facilitate collective decision making. It involves updates and changes that need to be made by the community to the operational rules in order to adapt to a changing world. All blockchains require some form of governance to implement changes on the network. Governance is usually classified into 2 types: on-chain and off-chain governance.\\n\\nOn-Chain Governance operates according to a system of rules that have been encoded directly into the Blockchain framework with the help of smart contracts. Developers propose changes through code updates and each node votes on whether to accept or reject the proposed change.\\n\\nOff-chain governance is generally implemented outside the blockchain through a system of rules, procedures, and social norms that are not as rigid and formalized as those of a code-based system.\\n\\nOne of the biggest disadvantages and problems faced by governance models which involve on-chain voting is low voter turnout, this is usually linked with miscommunication and voter apathy.\\n\\n# **The Case of Voter Apathy in Blockchain**\\n\\nWith On-Chain governance gaining steam and evolving in the past years being considered as a truly decentralized model of governance, more projects with on-chain voting have started to take form. While the importance of different proposals may vary, we can often consider the voter turnout during on-chain voting as a general indicator of community participation in governance.\\n\\n![Image of How Decentralized Notifications can Revolutionize On-Chain Governance (Part I)!](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n\\\\*Including voter abstains, Cosmos, Tezos and Decred voter turnout increase to 42%, 72% and 86% respectively. Thanks to [Foreground Capital](https://medium.com/u/ec02790acc52) for consolidating much of this [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1Z4UfUJlROl-AMDcC8F6ue6vjubHo9y-nZhOzxM2K79Q/edit#gid=979075578).\\n\\nWith the above chart as reference (form data collected to [Foreground Capital](https://medium.com/u/ec02790acc52)) we can see that the voter turnout with regard to circulating supply is not as high or community involved, as one would expect. If we plot out the number of wallet addresses with respect to the % of circulating supply that takes part in voting, this gap widens, which even makes one wonder, how decentralized is this model if a few rich whales have the power to swing voting results. One of the most obvious ways to make the current system more decentralized is by trying to drive the number of voter turnout higher, especially for critical upgrade proposals.\\n\\n![Image of How Decentralized Notifications can Revolutionize On-Chain Governance (Part I)!](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nOn-Chain Voter Turnout represented as a % of participating wallet addresses. Note: data is incomplete as participating wallet addresses were difficult to identify.\\n\\nIn his article \u201c[Blockchain Voter Apathy](https://medium.com/wave-financial/blockchain-voter-apathy-69a1570e2af3)\u201d, Roy Learner states that one of the reasons for this low voter turnout could be because of the poor voting infrastructure that exists today. The User experience is extremely flawed. He also states that Subject Matter Expertise could also be a reason, \u201c Token holders are not always subject matter experts. For example, a casual holder of MKR may not have the economics background required to vote on the implications of an increase or decrease in Maker\u2019s stability fee\u2026 Given the time required to truly understand the ramifications of a proposal vote, voter apathy may be higher for more complex proposals. Community leaders can help address this with market education but the average user just may not be willing to devote significant time researching the nuances and implications of a specific proposal.\u201d\\n\\nOne of the main reasons for this \u2014 one can deduce \u2014 is the lack of a standardized communication medium which informs users of critical voting sessions that take place on-chain. How does a standardized but decentralized communication medium help in reducing voter apathy? It keeps the user base up to date on the state of the network and educates and encourages the casual users along with the expert users to be more involved with the state of the chain as well as the happenings in the community. This makes the users more proactive and more prone to make educated decisions when the time comes to vote. In other words, the gap between the casual and an educated user of the chain will be narrowed significantly.\\n\\n# **EPNS to the Rescue!**\\n\\nSo far we have talked about the low voter turnout and voter apathy which is often associated with on-chain governance. We also discuss why this all leads to the need for a standardized communication medium needed between the protocol and its users. Enter EPNS- a decentralized push notification protocol built on top of the Ethereum chain. EPNS aims to provide a standard, transparent and efficient communication channel to be established between Web3 services and its users.\\n\\nUsing [EPNS Channels](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/a-beginners-guide-to-epns-channels-755cc18bff81), channel owners can send notifications to their subscribers; this feature could be used to help developers create a focal point during critical governance voting processes. Establishing such a decentralized yet efficient connection with the user base not only empowers the Web3.0 space, but also helps in better governance for the chains themselves by keeping their users up to date in community and chain-related matters, and potentially reduce voter apathy.\\n\\nLet\u2019s take the earlier example of YAM. When the developers found a bug in the YAM protocol, they had to act quickly; they were required to rally as much as 1,600,000 YAM to be delegated in the governance bug-fix proposal to avoid the whole protocol to crash. Although there were other factors that would have made the proposal become unsuccessful when deployed, what we would like to focus here is the medium they used to gather their votes \u2014 Twitter and [a Medium article](https://medium.com/@yamfinance/save-yam-245598d81cec).\\n\\n\u2018SAVE YAM!\u2019 Campaign Announcement post on Twitter\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, using social media as a communication medium for such critical and important issues is far from ideal, and in fact, by the proposal did get the threshold votes, it was too little too late. With only about 14.4K followers on their Twitter account, relying on such platforms make it difficult for critical information to be passed through to the consumers.\\n\\nNow imagine what could have been with the help of **EPNS**.\\n\\nThe YAM core team with EPNS could have sent out a _Broadcast Message_ to all Wallet Addresses with YAM tokens, wherein they specify the bug in the code, as well as direct users to the platform where they could have voted to ensure the timely survival of the protocol. This would have ensured that all users of the protocol would be notified of such a vote taking place, and hence vote almost instantly, thus creating a more efficient and optimized way for On-Chain voting.\\n\\nExample, use case for YAM Governance voting.\\n\\n![Image of How Decentralized Notifications can Revolutionize On-Chain Governance (Part I)!](./image-4.webp)\\n\\nSAVE YAM!!\\n\\nIn this way, EPNS is able to act as a decentralized notification system in order to increase voter turnout, as well as reduce voter apathy, by providing timely and immediate information to users hence allowing casual users to also be better involved in the happenings of the protocol.\\n\\n# **Conclusion**\\n\\nWith the ever-evolving growth of on-chain governance models, comes the issue of voter apathy and low voter turnout which largely undermines the notion of decentralization within the chain since we see that users with more stake only come up to vote on governance-related matters. With EPNS we provide not only a way to establish a better connection for chain developers with the user base, but also allows greater fluidity in the governance of the chain itself. It provides a way to narrow the gap between casual and subject experts when it comes to governance and hence enables the growth of the chain in a way that is purely decentralized.\\n\\nEPNS not only **_gives_** power back to the people but is also an integral tool **_to give_** that power to the people.\\n\\nIf you like what EPNS is attempting to do by shaking the very foundations of blockchain & decentralized communication, and you would like to follow our journey\u2026\\n\\n_Consider joining our buzzing Social Media Community!_\\n\\n> _Telegram:_ [_https://t.me/epnsproject_](https://t.me/epnsproject)\\n>\\n> _Twitter:_ [_https://twitter.com/epnsproject_](https://twitter.com/epnsproject)\\n>\\n> Github*:* [_https://github.com/push-protocol_](https://github.com/push-protocol)"},{"id":"a-beginners-guide-to-epns-channels","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-epns-channels","source":"@site/blog/2020-08-14-a-beginners-guide-to-epns-channels/index.md","title":"A Beginner\u2019s Guide to EPNS Channels!","description":"A Beginner\u2019s Guide to EPNS Channels!","date":"2020-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 14, 2020","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Web3","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/web-3"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Blog","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":4.89,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"a-beginners-guide-to-epns-channels","title":"A Beginner\u2019s Guide to EPNS Channels!","description":"A Beginner\u2019s Guide to EPNS Channels!","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"With the dawn of Web3.0 and the rising need for a decentralized communication system between dApp services and users, came the creation of **Ethereum Push Notification Service** (EPNS).

EPNS is a **decentralized notification protocol** at its heart. It provides the means to communicate information which can be of different types, carry different utilities and perform different tasks as per their use cases. It also allows users to be in control of what notifications they receive allowing them to subscribe to and even unsubscribe from the channels that they deem fit.\\n\\nAll this sounds great! But now the question arises from someone who is providing a dApp service \u2014 \u201c_How do I create a channel and access all these cool features to be able to communicate with my clients?_\u201d.\\n\\nAnd the solution, my dear friend, is actually really (and I do mean REALLY) simple! But before I answer that question for you, let\u2019s just lay down a general idea of what a channel is and what can it really do.\\n\\n# Channels\\n\\n> Any user on the protocol who activates themselves on it to send notifications is called a **Channel**.\\n\\nIn other words, anyone who is a user of the protocol has the ability to become a channel owner and start sending notifications to its subscribers. One may consider this to be something similar to a Youtube Channel, where any user \u2014 if they want to \u2014 can create a channel and start posting content on their channel.\\n\\nA service just needs to follow a one-time procedure in order to upgrade itself to create a channel and the channel owner will always be the first subscriber of the channel as soon as the channel is activated, it\u2019s not possible to remove the channel owner (subscriber) from their own channel.\\n\\n## Types Of Channels\\n\\nJust like any other feature provided in the protocol, EPNS provides the channel owner full freedom in what kind of a channel it wants to create based on its business use case! This allows channel owners to be flexible and adapt their own channel to the use case they wish to accomplish from the protocol. Currently, the protocol offers 3 main types of channels with the promise to add even more types in the near future!\\n\\nThe 3 types of channels available now are:\\n\\n1\\\\. **Open Channel**: This is the default channel type on EPNS. In this, the channel is created by the service and is intended to be open for any user to come and subscribe without any restrictions. But it doesn\u2019t end there, what if you as a service wants to add a user to the channel to increase reach? In this case, a channel can also indirectly subscribe the user to it, but here\u2019s the catch, the channel must pay the user a minor fee in order to do an indirect subscription. This creates a **win-win** situation for both the user and the channel \u2014 the channel is able to bring a new user into their communication stream and the user gets paid a fee for being subscribed to the channel without consent. But if a user feels that the channel is not of their interest, they may choose to unsubscribe from that channel and the channel will not be able to add that same user back again through indirect subscription, in this way the user still has a control on what they see and do not see!\\n\\n2\\\\. **Closed Channel**: A service can opt to create a closed channel. Just as the name suggests, these types of channels are closed and cannot be directly subscribed by the user, but can only be added by the channel owner. A good analogy to this would be your group chats in your favourite messaging apps like Whatsapp and Telegram (if you haven\u2019t joined our Telegram group do so [here](https://t.me/epnsproject)!). Just like group chats in Whatsapp \u2014 only users added to the group are able to communicate with the group members and see messages passed within the group \u2014 Closed channels provide a way for services to control to an extent which users are able to access the channel and be a part of it. And yes, the minor fee still exists, since the service is technically subscribing users to their channel without consent, it is an indirect subscription.\\n\\nLet\u2019s take the example of MakerDAO. MakerDAO can create an official channel where any user can subscribe to it (open channel) but they can also create a MakerDAO Token Holder Channel wherein they only allow wallet addresses that hold the MakerDAO tokens to gain access to the channel. What would be the reason they would create such a channel? Well, MakerDAO would add token holders for the purpose of governance voting. In this way, they get to ensure to provide a smooth means of communication with the user as well as organize their governance system much better.\\n\\n3\\\\. **Mutual Channel:** EPNS also allows a service to create a mutual channel \u2014 one could say, a mix of both the above types of channels \u2014 In this the user may opt to subscribe directly to the service channel but will only be considered subscribed after the mutual consent of the channel owner as well. This could be considered as sending a follow request to a private Instagram account!\\n\\nA channel can be updated as long as there are no subscribers. The channel becomes immutable as soon as a new subscriber joins the channel.\\n\\n# What must I do to activate a Channel?\\n\\nSo far we have explored what a channel is and the different types of channels there are. So what must a user do to activate itself as a channel?\\n\\nAs stated before, a service needs to activate itself on the protocol as a one-time step before they can send notifications to their subscribers. When a service is activated on the protocol, they are referred to as a Channel.\\n\\nDid we mention that a user earns tokens when they subscribe to a channel? Good news, they do!\\n\\nBut where do these tokens come from?\\n\\nWhen a channel is activated, the channel is required to stake fees in DAI of 50 DAI or higher, this is used to create a staking pool which in turn interacts with the AAVE Protocol to earn interest. This interest is then distributed back to all the subscribers of the channel of that service in a weighted manner, favouring early subscribers more than the later ones. So if a channel stakes more DAI, then it incentivizes more users to subscribe to their channel in order to earn higher interests!\\n\\n## What can a Channel Owner do?\\n\\nSo, you\u2019ve activated yourself as a channel, you\u2019ve staked your DAI, you\u2019ve even started to get subscribers. Now what? Well, now you may send various types of notifications to your subscribers! Gone are the old days of dreading a boring old plain text notification, now you may even add images, videos and link to your own website through the EPNS protocol!\\n\\nAlthough notifications and its types may be an article on itself, here is a small brief on the various types of notifications provided by the protocol.\\n\\n1\\\\. **Direct Payload Notification**: Direct payloads are special payloads meant for sending directly to the protocol.\\n\\n2\\\\. **Broadcast Notification**: Broadcast notification goes to all subscribers of a channel; the notification payload, in this case, is not encrypted.\\n\\n3\\\\. **Secret Notification**: Secret notifications are intended to be delivered to one subscriber of the channel, and are encrypted.\\n\\n4\\\\. **Targeted Notification**: Targeted notifications go to a single subscriber of a channel; the notification payload, in this case, is not encrypted.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nEPNS is a decentralized DeFi Notification protocol that enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications and earn from them. It enables wallet addresses to receive notifications in a platform-agnostic fashion from both decentralized and centralized carriers.\\n\\nWith incentives for users to subscribe to channels in order to gain weighted interest from the stake of the channel and with the added flexibility for channels to create different types of channels to reach out to their user in not just plain text notifications but also various forms of multimedia like video and images. Services get to fulfil their business goal to be able to reach their customers and provide a more fluid and dynamic experience. Services can now reach their users, rather than a user going to the service. EPNS sounds like a good deal for almost every participant involved!\\n\\n_Connect with us if you have any questions!_\\n\\n> _Telegram:_ [_https://t.me/epnsproject_](https://t.me/epnsproject)\\n>\\n> _Twitter:_ [_https://twitter.com/epnsproject_](https://twitter.com/epnsproject)\\n>\\n> [_Github_](https://github.com/push-protocol)_:_ [_https://github.com/push-protocol_](https://github.com/push-protocol)\\n\\n_Reference:_ [_EPNS Whitepaper_](https://whitepaper.epns.io/)"},{"id":"epns-update-gitcoin-kernel-week-3","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/epns-update-gitcoin-kernel-week-3","source":"@site/blog/2020-08-09-epns-update-gitcoin-kernel-week-3/index.md","title":"EPNS Update: Gitcoin Kernel Week 3","description":"EPNS Update: Gitcoin Kernel Week 3","date":"2020-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 9, 2020","tags":[{"label":"Blockchain","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"label":"Gitcoin","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/gitcoin"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Blog","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":1.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"epns-update-gitcoin-kernel-week-3","title":"EPNS Update: Gitcoin Kernel Week 3","description":"EPNS Update: Gitcoin Kernel Week 3","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"Hello Awesome folks!!

We are super excited to share the project updates, woohoo!!\\n\\nBefore deep diving with our updates, we just wanted a moment to express how we feel\u2026 spoiler alert: we feel awesome!\\n\\nIt\u2019s been amazing how comfortable we feel with the entire Kernel team (them feeling that is however a question we left to them :D). Shoutout to our fellow peeps and mentors who are not only brilliant but always there to help and guide us, we are so grateful and happy to be a part of this journey.\\n\\nBinded by the love for all things web3 and passion for building the next generation of products to be better in every aspect is what guides all of us and having a platform to achieve this is what we have come to know **Gitcoin Kernel** to be.\\n\\nAlso, thanks Vivek, Andy (we want to trend him as the mathematical philosopher), Scott & the \u2018wiz-kid\u2019 Sachin for enabling these conversations and guiding us to make \u201cvalue-centric\u201d products for the community.\\n\\n### Updates and the Designer\u2019s Garden\\n\\nThe designer garden week is all about understanding users and making sure that the product doesn\u2019t suck, trust us, you definitely need to know this before committing your life to the product.\\n\\nPut it another way, no matter how much love you have for your product, it\u2019s the users who decide they need it or not. Thanks to this week\u2019s mentors Zach, Katie and Andrej who drilled this into our head. Research, prototyping and user journeys are incredibly powerful tools which everyone should us.\\n\\n> For our earlier successful products, this would have saved us weeks of development for features which we thought user will dig (but they didn\u2019t). And for products that didn\u2019t work, this would have definitely saved us months.\\n>\\n> Someone invent a time machine already! and contact us at [timemachine@epns.io](mailto://timemachine@epns.io), not kidding, we just made that mail to see how this works out.\\n\\n# Users Synthesis Results\\n\\nEthereum Push Notification Service first major pivot occurred as a result of user validation and feedback sessions.\\n\\nShoutout to **Luka Su\u010di\u0107** and **Pranay Valson** for giving their valuable time to validate / invalidate our features and give some of the really awesome suggestions and how earlier products (like MEW, etc) did it, we tested:\\n\\n1.  User need for notification \u2014 **Validated**\\n2.  User preferred communication mode (now and after EPNS) \u2014 **Validated**\\n3.  User comfortable in entering their private key (for decrypting their encrypted notification) with open repo for verification \u2014 **Invalidated**\\n\\nYes! you read that right, our private key for login to our mobile app for receiving notification through our protocol was Invalidated. But, as luck would have it, along came another one of our kernel fellow: **Alexander Salnikov** who solved this problem for us\u2026 and we can\u2019t believe how easy the solution is!!\\n\\nThis led to another user validation session of sorts where we were lucky to have **Denham Preen** and **Andy Tudhope**, who of course acted as a quick way to validate out new hypothesis. In short, Kernel and our gang of 250+ peeps did this for us.\\n\\n![Cover Image of EPNS Update : Gitcoin Kernel Week-1](./image-1.gif)\\n\\nHey you, yes you!!\\n\\n# Prototype for the curios\\n\\nCurios to see what we are #BUIDLing and to give feedback? Awesome! Let\u2019s get started!\\n\\n## 1\\\\. Users receives notifications from EPNS protocol to mobile app and prefer that over dApp or desktop notifications or other form of communication\\n\\n![Cover Image of EPNS Update : Gitcoin Kernel Week-1](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nThe above shows how notifications comes to our mobile platform (excluding our dApp platform and other integration of wallets).\\n\\nThe notification can be about your trade on a dEx is completed, or ENS sending your wallet notification that your domain is expiring, or Bancor or other services sending you notification about a certain security or marketing notification.\\n\\n**Do keep in mind that you as a user will subscribe to these services first on protocol (or they will pay you the amount you set for yourself to add your wallet as their subscriber) before they can send you notification.**\\n\\n![Cover Image of EPNS Update : Gitcoin Kernel Week-1](./image-3.webp)\\n\\n**Questions:**\\n\\n- How do you feel about this new form of communication?\\n- What is the preferred way for you to receive communication to dApps or other web3 services? Why? What do you love about them?\\n- Can you arrange the following form of communication for us (from the above screenshot) in form of your preference?\\n\\n## 2\\\\. User signs in with private key(creds never leaves device, open repo) on mobile app to authenticate and decrypt encrypted notifications coming from protocol\\n\\n![Cover Image of EPNS Update : Gitcoin Kernel Week-1](./image-4.webp)\\n\\nThis is **already invalidated**, but instead, imagine the sign in to now just ask your wallet address. All notifications are received and plain ones are shown on feed though encrypted one will require you to enter your private key if you want to decrypt them and see those.\\n\\n**Questions**:\\n\\n- What is your experience like when you first signed in to Metamask or MEW?\\n- How do you feel about signing in to the our mobile app?\\n- How comfortable do you feel about using our Mobile App, dApp?\\n- What can be done to improve the experience?\\n\\n# Protocol Updates : What we built this week\\n\\n- Upgradability in the protocol\\n- Design specs for spam and spoof mechanism\\n- Rework of the authentication flow\\n\\n# Project Updates : What we learned this week\\n\\n- Users feedback is critical for success, it might not be the success you want but it\u2019s the thing you need.\\n- Collaboration with brilliant minds generates better ideas than your team or you can do alone.\\n- It\u2019s okay to ask for help, awesome people are always willing to go the extra mile but you need to return the favor as well!\\n\\n# Project News : What we accomplished this week\\n\\n- Making friends and bonds for life at Kernel\\n- Learning from the best mentors and Kernel fellows\\n- Growing and maturing our thought process\\n- EPNS honored to be included the [DeFi Pulse list](https://t.co/j87Zje9t3V?amp=1)\\n- Some nice news coverage by our friends at [Moj Kripto](https://mojkripto.com/ethereum-push-notification-service-epns-interview/?lang=en) and [Finstreet](https://www.finstreet.in/crypto-news-tata-consultancy-yuan-project-gitcoin-accelerator-program/)\\n- Recorded the most fun podcast about EPNS, our journey and all things DeFi\u2026. shhhhhhh\u2026 Keep you posted :)\\n- Learnt Gitcoin Sachin lives 1.6 miles away , it\u2019s a small world!!\\n\\nThis is all for now.

Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s already week -3!! It\u2019s been an amazing learning experience so far. A big shout out to the [ETHGlobal Team](https://medium.com/u/8687f4bcbbed?source=post_page-----f5f5a1a2c477--------------------------------) for always being there to help and organizing the best AMAs and office hours sessions. Getting feedback and ideas from the devs at [Aavesome](https://medium.com/u/13bfa9f22920?source=post_page-----f5f5a1a2c477--------------------------------), Compound, etc has made this learning process about DeFi landscape and tech amazingly fun.\\n\\nTo begin with, we never wanted to deliver plain notifications to the users. We mean they are cool but there are so many things you can do when you make notifications behave like your twitter feed. This led us to think a lot about the payloads, analogies and the way we want to present notifications\u2026 and that\u2019s how we came up with\u2026 drumbeats\u2026 notification feed and different formats of notifications.\\n\\n### Groups and secrets\u2026and secret groups?!\\n\\nLet\u2019s talk about the recipients of notifications first. Yes, there are two different target recipients: Groups and Secrets. Simply put, a channel owner or smart contract can send a broadcast to all recipients of their channel or can send encrypted messages (known as secret) to an individual person.\\n\\n#### Group Messages\\n\\nGroup messages serve the purpose of communicating a piece of information to a subscribed channel. For example, Gitcoin can alert the developer community about the recently added 1000USD bounty task to its pool (that would be exciting!!).\\n\\nBut wait, there\u2019s more\u2026 we went a step further\u2026while group messages are a great way to send out notifications to a group of users, we thought the ability to send encrypted messages from channel owners to a specific user would really add so much value to push notifications in a variety of different ways.\\n\\n#### Secret Messages\\n\\nSo how does the secret message work? Well, blockchain and specifically cryptocurrency has crypto in it for a reason, more on the specific details later as we think it needs an article on its own.\\n\\nThough in brief terms, the way we achieve this is by encrypting few parts of the message payload with a secret that is further encrypted by the user\u2019s public key.\\n\\nFor example, Aavesome can send its customer a message once the loan liquidation is complete.\\n\\n### Message attributes\\n\\nLet\u2019s talk message attributes aka how rich we can present user\u2019s with the information.\\n\\nMessages are more useful (and more fun) when they are clickable, when you can interact with them and when they contain a number of great contexts. This was the approach we used to form different attributes for the message.\\n\\nThe idea is to give the channel owners enough flexibility so that they can play with permutations and combinations of message types and come up with intuitive messages for their users.\\n\\nThere are 4 message attributes.\\n\\n1. Subject\\n2. Message text\\n3. Call To Action (CTA)\\n4. Image\\n\\n### Use Cases\\n\\nMessages get delivered to users as feeds on their [EPNS mobile app](https://medium.com/@epnsdapp/hello-world-buidling-a-working-epns-mobile-app-e9dcb8f5ed66), just like your Twitter feed, with flexible opt-in/opt-out capability to give users full control over the notifications they want to receive.\\n\\nThe cool thing about epns push notifications is that there are multiple ways of building messages to cater to different types of web3 users.\\n\\nAn epns general message is composed using a subject and message text together. Here we tried to make the message more interesting by introducing rich text format. Supporting text styles, bold, italics, colors, links, etc can be sent for enhanced user readability. This is a classic format of push notification to share key updates with the subscribed user group.\\n\\nFor example, it would be awesome to get notified when Uniswap V2 platform is launched this Q2 through a simple notification.\\n\\nWe took a stab at generating a few examples for the purpose of demonstrating how epns push notifications look in real life.\\n\\n![Uniswap V2 launch party Notification Image](./image-1.webp)\\n<ImageText>Looks like we are invited to the party!!</ImageText>\\n\\n![ENS Notification Image](./image-2.webp)\\n<ImageText>General Message Type</ImageText>\\n\\nTaking it further, epns messages lets the user tap on a link embedded in the notification. This type of message includes a Call to Action(CTA) wrapped in a group message explained above. This CTA+group message type is meant for a group of users to guide them to a dedicated web page of an event, news, sign-up form, etc.\\n\\nFor example, the [ETHGlobal Team](https://medium.com/u/8687f4bcbbed?source=post_page-----f5f5a1a2c477--------------------------------) can send out a notification to all hackers for 2021 Virtual Hackathon registration, the user has to simply click on the link in the feed to find the registration form.\\n\\n![Ethglobal notification Image](./image-3.webp)\\n\\nNow, these messages get more interesting when integrated with secret messages (meant for a single user). These targeted or smart CTAs can help enhance user experience as they securely deliver the right message to the right user.\\n\\nFor example, Binance DEX can send user notifications once their trade order is fulfilled.\\n\\n![EPNS Notification Image](./image-4.webp)\\n![Binance Notification Image](./image-5.webp)\\n\\nBut wait!! EPNS notifications can support images as well. A secret message with images can do so many cool things for a user.\\n\\nFor example, if a user\'s ENS domain name is in grace period and about to expire, the ENS team can send out encrypted QR image-based notification to its users. The user can then simply scan the QR image on their ENS domain page to complete the renewal and payment process.\\n\\n![App Bot Notification Image](./image-6.webp)\\n<ImageText>\\nEncrypted Image Message\\n</ImageText>\\n\\nWe think there are multiple ways in which epns push notifications can add value to the decentralized finance ecosystem. The possibilities and use cases with epns notifications are endless and we are just getting started :)\\n\\n<b>TLDR; try out the (almost complete) <a href=\'https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-system/epns-mobile-app\'>react native</a> app.</b>\\n\\nNext up, the dApp and the smart contract\u2026Please feel free to share your support and amazing feedback."},{"id":"hello-world-buid-ling-a-working-epns-mobile-app","metadata":{"permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/hello-world-buid-ling-a-working-epns-mobile-app","source":"@site/blog/2020-05-01-hello-world-buid-ling-a-working/index.md","title":"Hello World: BUIDLing a working EPNS Mobile app","description":"Cover Image of Hello World: BUIDLing a working EPNS Mobile app","date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 1, 2020","tags":[{"label":"Ethereum","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"label":"Solidity","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/solidity"},{"label":"Ethglobal","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/ethglobal"},{"label":"Notifications","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/notifications"},{"label":"Developer","permalink":"/push-website/pr-preview/pr-1061/blog/tags/developer"}],"readingTime":2.3866666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Push Protocol","url":"https://x.com/PushChain","imageURL":"/assets/blog/authors/authorpush.png","key":"push"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hello-world-buid-ling-a-working-epns-mobile-app","title":"Hello World: BUIDLing a working EPNS Mobile app","authors":["push"],"image":"./cover-image.webp","text":"It\u2019s another day at EthGlobal HackMoney hackathon and we are back with more detail and further progress.

We are quite happy with the app specs and don\u2019t think that will change anytime soon while we wanted to think and iterate a bit more on smart contract so we choose this route. Without further ado, Let\u2019s dive into how we are going to create the magic in the mobile app.\\n\\n### Features\\n\\nThe EPNS mobile app is built using react native and provides the following features:\\n\\n- App should be able to receive push notifications.\\n- App should be able to connect the user\u2019s wallet (singular at the moment) in a secure manner.\\n- App should connect the user wallet to the push notification device tokens that are generated by Apple Push Notification Service or Android Push Notification Service.\\n- App should be able to send this information to the epns server in a secure format.\\n- App should be able to fetch user notifications (kind of like emails) that were already delivered to them.\\n\\n![Notification announcement Image](./image-1.webp)\\n<ImageText>We all get a notification, woohoo !!</ImageText>\\n\\n### Tech Specs\\n\\nMobile push notifications use [device tokens](https://help.pushwoosh.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000364923-What-is-a-Device-token-) for registration of the device and the push notification server then sends out mass or specific messages using these device tokens. For EPNS to work, we need to register these device tokens as well as the wallet to which they belong to.\\n\\nFor the EPNS Service to work, the following modules need to be built:\\n\\n- Storing User Wallet Private Key (Offline on the User\u2019s Device)\\n- Mapping user\u2019s wallet address to device tokens\\n- Communicate with the epns server to verify and store these device tokens (mapped to wallet address)\\n- Handling Incoming Push Notifications\\n- Fetching Previous Notifications of the User\\n\\n#### Storing User Wallet Private Key (Offline on the User\u2019s Device)\\n\\nThe app needs to store the user\u2019s wallet private key to decrypt the message received by the user and to encrypt the token registration process. This ensures that the epns server only maps the verified device tokens to the user wallet.\\n\\nFurthermore, we need to provide either biometric or passcode based security to the user in the app since the app is storing sensitive user credentials. We will also be storing these user credentials in an encrypted format, we will mostly be using [React-Native-Keychain](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-keychain) for this.\\n\\n#### Mapping user\u2019s wallet address to device tokens\\n\\nOnce a user has imported the wallet, the device tokens which are generated would be mapped to the wallet of the user.\\n\\n#### Communicate with the epns server to verify and store these device tokens (mapped to wallet address)\\n\\nWe will mostly be using [Eth-Crypto](https://github.com/pubkey/eth-crypto) to handle the secure verification process.\\n\\nCurrent proposal is to send the operation code as <b>Register</b> along with the device token as the signature of the user using the above library and the public wallet address. The server will first decrypt the hash to find the public wallet address of the user and will only proceed if the public wallet address sent matches with the decrypted address of the public wallet.

Notifications can be sent via the web, mobile, and Web3.0 providers like Metamask. To ensure consistent messaging throughout the project we have created the following nomenclature of terms, roles that will be used in the rest of the project lifecycle.\\n\\n- Contract Owner \u2014 The owner of the contract, specifically the address by whom the contract is deployed.\\n- App Owner \u2014 Referred to as <b>Channel Owners</b>. The third-party projects, dApps or smart contract, specifically the address which form their identity as well as the custom opt-in group that the subscribed users will receive message from.\\n- Users \u2014 All the users who don\u2019t fall in either of the above categories.\\n- App Owner Group \u2014 Referred to as <b>Channel</b>. The group which contains subscribed users of a particular channel.\\n- Subscribed Users \u2014 The users who have subscribed to a specific channel.\\n\\nFor the purpose of explaining the above EPNS terms, let\u2019s take the example of Youtube and the various associated roles.\\n\\n- Youtube \u2014 Contract Owner\\n- Channels \u2014 App Owner Groups\\n- Channel Owners \u2014 App Owners\\n- Users \u2014 Users\\n- Subscribed Users \u2014 Users subscribed to a specific App owner group\\n\\n<b>Game Theory -- Push</b>\\n\\nIn order to ensure the proper participation of all roles, following game theory is proposed, features marked with \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* will mostly be excluded from the upcoming MVP:\\n\\n- The <b>contract owner</b> doesn\u2019t have any ability to send messages on behalf of <b>channel owners</b>.\\n- The <b>channel owners</b> might spoof other trusted apps and thus will have to be verified or a spam system developed so that users can mark them as spoof or a similar mechanism.\\n- The <b>channel owners</b> need explicit permission from the users before messages can be sent to them.\\n- The <b>channel owners</b> need to stake some minimum DAI to ensure a spam-free environment, this is going to be minimal but good enough to ascertain good behavior (for example, 50 DAI).\\n- The <b>users</b> need to transact on blockchain to specifically subscribe or unsubscribe to a channel, this leads to an incentive issue, ie: why would a user spend gas in most cases?\\n- To counter this, The staked DAI from <b>channel owners</b> can inturn be used as an incentive for <b>users</b> to subscribe to the specific channel.\\n- This can be done by using services like AAVE to accrue interest on the said DAI and distribute it to the subscribed users group.\\n- This incentivizes the users to spend gas to perform \u201csubscribe\u201d transaction operation.\\n- The <b>channel owners</b> can stake more DAI if they want to since the users are incentivized to subscribe.\\n- The <b>channel owner</b> can blacklist a certain user from their channel if they want to.\\n- The <b>channel owners</b> can reclaim this DAI back, reclaiming this DAI will also destroy the channel, a fee of 10 DAI will also be held back for the <b>contract owner</b>, the fees is small enough for serious players to not worry about but will act as a further deterrent for bad players.\\n\\nWe would love to hear your feedback and ideas to better the overall experience.
