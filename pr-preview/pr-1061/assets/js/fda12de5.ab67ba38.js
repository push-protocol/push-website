This support was transformed with the advent of innovative grants protocols that converted this mechanism into funding for awesome and exceptional projects!\\n\\nThe need for platforms to enable contribution to public goods and give them much needed boost in terms of motivation, visibility and success has never been so clear. [CLR Fund](https://clr.fund) is another innovation that has happened in this sector as has been seen in EthDenver 2021 and how it tied voting with funding.\\n\\nWe are ecstatic to announce that we are going to be working together with the [CLR Fund](https://clr.fund) team to enable informative notifications for funding for both the funders and the grantees. Besides being able to contribute towards the decentralized vision, we would also gain insights about the features requirement for EPNS protocol. This would help us shape the V1 protocol to be versatile enough to support multiple features as should be the case with a communication middleware.\\n\\nWith this pilot program with the CLR.fund team we are looking forward to:\\n\\nEnable creating a new communication layer within the CLR platform, that allows the users to receive decentralized notifications regarding events like:\\n\\n- When a round has started or finalized\\n- When a contributions is received\\n- When funds are claimed\\n- When a tally is published\\n- Working with the CLR.fund team to enable technical brainstorming towards improving the EPNS protocol to become more scalable and powerful.\\n\\n## **About clr.fund**\\n\\nClr.fund is a protocol for efficiently allocating funds to public goods that benefit the Ethereum Ecosystem according to the preferences of the Ethereum Ecosystem. Clr.fund strives for credible neutrality, decentralization, permissionlessness, trustlessness, and pseudonymity.\\n\\nStay in touch with clr.fund!
