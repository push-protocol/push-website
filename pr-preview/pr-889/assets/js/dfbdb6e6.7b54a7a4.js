Preparing backend tooling for monitoring, working on the PUSH Nodes, improvements to our dApp & SDKs, and of course one of out most awaited features \u2014 Wallet to Wallet communication.\\n\\n- The <b>Analytics Dashboard</b> have been in development to provide services with insights about notifications and their channels. The entire backend Integration is done, and the Dashboard will be released very soon.\\n- With <b>PUSH Nodes</b> being a central piece in the EPNS ecosystem, optimization together with the standardization of payloads plays a critical role to ensure its optimal functionality. As we start making it publicly available anyone will be able to submit an improvement proposals for it.\\n- On the decentralizing of PUSH Nnodes side, we are segregating nodes into modules. So, participants can spin up their own node and provide the service to the network to send notifications\\n- The <b>EPNS Smart Contract v1.5 Audit</b> is coming to its last stage. Many new features will come together as we deploy this new version of the smart contracts. More details will be provided soon!\\n- Content markdown standards for frontend SDK are in the works.\\n- <b>Wallet to Wallet</b> code reviews are done. Currently going over extensive testing and also working with design team to provide a great UI ready for launch.\\n- <b>EPNS dApp UI/UX improvements</b> for a better experience for channel creators and users. Also working on getting the sending notifications ready for multi-chain support.\\n\\nWith so many development efforts happening concurrently, there is so much room for conversation and discussion.
