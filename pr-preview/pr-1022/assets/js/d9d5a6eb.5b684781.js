Such alerts can get lost in the noise and, while they do address the needs of the community today, can\u2019t keep up with community growth and don\u2019t align with the Web3 ethos of full decentralization.\\n\\nToday, EPNS is excited to announce that we are partnering with the YAM Finance team to develop the communication and notifications layer of YAM. YAM is among the strongest communities and protocols in the DeFi space, and we are looking forward to working with the team to enable YAM users to enjoy the benefits of notifs!\\n\\nThe collaboration with the YAM team will also help us in understanding the requirements of innovative services in the market and to develop additional features for the V1 of our protocol based on their invaluable inputs.\\n\\nOur pilot program with YAM Finance will consist of:\\n\\n- Creating a channel for YAM Finance to notify their users of liquidation risks. Users will get notified before reaching their minimum collateral ratio.\\n- Exploring and building further important notifications for various use cases in the YAM Ecosystem, such as alerts on governance actions (snapshot and on-chain votes).\\n- Working with the YAM Finance team to enable technical discussions towards building a decentralized communication layer that is scalable and powerful for the whole of Web3.0.\\n\\n## **About YAM Finance**\\n\\nYAM Finance is a community-owned DAO that is innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance. Yam started as a fair-launch DAO and is now building DeFi products such as Synthetic Tokens, Treasury Management as a Service for other DAOs and permissionless Insurance.\\n\\nStay in touch with YAM Finance!
