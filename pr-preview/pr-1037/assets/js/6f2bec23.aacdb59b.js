It is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain that allows developers to create universal apps and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, and L3s enabling transactions from any chain - any app and any user.\\n\\n[Explore more about Push Chain here](https://push.org/)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Bringing Diamante to Push Chain\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc65\xa0What does this mean for Diamante and Push Chain Users?\\n\\n**Universally accessible on-chain institutions**\\n\\nInstitutions thriving on Diamante can unlock a chain-less business experience that helps them to transact, and operate with its customers/clients in a chain-abstracted manner. \\n\\nThus, removing the need for any complex compliance measures for cross-chain transactions. All without leaving the ecosystem comfort offered by the Diamante chain.\\n\\n\\n**Unified web3 experiences**\\n\\nAs a universal settlement layer - Push Chain users belong to multiple L1, L2s and L3s - be it EVM or non-EVMs like Aptos and Solana.\\n\\nWith Push Chain - users from these wide varieties of chains can explore the rich Diamante Ecosystem and send transactions to any Diamante Apps without navigating multiple networks or managing multiple wallets - with zero or minimal learning curve!\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\xa0What does this mean for builders?\\n\\n**Build super abstracted - shared settlement institutional and consumer DApps**\\n\\nWith shared settlement capabilities of Push Chain and Diamante - devs can build apps with powerful chain, fee and wallet abstraction capabilities - allowing transactions from any chain with near-instant finality.\\n\\n**Build universally compliant consumer and mixed financial apps**\\n\\nPush Chain introduces a new transaction type: **\u2018consumer transactions\u2019**, where transaction ordering is not essential.\\n\\nWhy consumer tx? \\n\\nTwo major challenges hinder the scalability of consumer web3 apps:\\n\\n- **Chain Fragmentation-** User bases are over-diversified across hundreds of chains, impeding user growth, UX and retention.\\n- **Scalability constraints-** Most chains process transactions in a strictly ordered manner, which imposes unnecessary constraints on apps that don\u2019t rely on transaction ordering.\\n\\nThis is where Push Chain\u2019s Consumer Tx feature enables non-financial and consumer applications to operate with lightning-fast speed and hyper-scalability. Push Chain enables these apps to manage millions of users seamlessly across any chain environment.\\n\\n\\n[Learn more about Push Chain\u2019s Innovations here](https://push.org/blog/innovations-by-push-chain/).\\n\\n## **\ud83d\udd13\xa0Use case unlock:**\\n\\n**Unified Compliance Solutions-** Crypto KYC Services like [HyperSign](https://www.notion.so/17c188aea7f480fca231d69da721208d?pvs=21) can unlock wider distribution by providing their Crypto KYC services across any app belonging form any chain (evm or non-evm) by using Push\u2019s Shared Settlement and Consumer Txn support.\\n\\n**Universal GameFi-** - Game Studios and Launchpads like [Mon Protocol](https://www.notion.so/17c188aea7f480fca231d69da721208d?pvs=21) and [Isotopic](https://isotopic.io/) can leverage Push Chain to build **Universally Playable On-chain Games (UPOGs)**, supporting users from any chain with the power of Universal Smart Contracts and Any chain Consumer Transactions - providing sub-second finality and any chain compatibility.\\n\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf0c\xa0What does this mean for Web3?\\n\\n**Unifying experiences by bringing users together.**\\n\\nPush Chain isn\u2019t here to replace networks or compete with any; instead, it aims to eliminate the fragmented state of Web3 by unifying settlement across all chains under one universal shared state, unlocking a seamless, interconnected Web3 experience.\\n\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1.
