<p><strong>Build super abstracted - shared settlement apps</strong></p>
<p>With shared settlement capabilities of Push Chain and zkLink - devs can build apps with powerful chain, fee and wallet abstraction capabilities - allowing transactions from any chain with near-instant finality.</p>
<p><strong>Build universally compliant consumer and mixed financial apps</strong></p>
<p>Push Chain introduces a new transaction type: <strong>‘consumer transactions’</strong>, where transaction ordering is not essential.</p>
<p>Why consumer tx?</p>
<p>Two major challenges hinder the scalability of consumer web3 apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chain Fragmentation:</strong> User bases are over-diversified across hundreds of chains, impeding user growth, UX and retention.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability constraints</strong> Most chains process transactions in a strictly ordered manner, which imposes unnecessary constraints on apps that don’t rely on transaction ordering.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where Push Chain’s Consumer Tx feature enables non-financial and consumer applications to operate with lightning-fast speed and hyper-scalability. Push Chain enables these apps to manage millions of users seamlessly across any chain environment.</p>

<p>Addressing the growing adoption of Push Chat we added some extra cool features to make your on-chain wallet-to-wallet and group chatting experience more fun!</p>
<p>Starting with adding support for <strong>Farcaster frames</strong>!
With the growing adoption of <a href="https://www.farcaster.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Farcaster</a>, a popular web3 social app on Base, we’ve integrated support for Farcaster Frames in Push Chat. These frames unlock unique in-chat experiences, from making payments and subscribing to notifications to playing games or building any functionality developers envision.</p>
<p>In addition to frames, we added two of the most wildly used web2 chat features - <strong>Reactions and Reply to Chat features!</strong></p>
<p>Especially helpful in group and conditionally gated group chats where a user needs to revert to a specific user's conversation.</p>

<p>Push DAO witnessed extraordinary exposure and participation in 2024.</p>
<p>With hundreds of new participants, over 50 regular contributors, global exposure, quality grantees, and tremendous support from the Push Fam community, we've made exceptional progress.</p>
<p>In June 2024, we launched Push DAO V2 to advance our journey toward progressive decentralization.
This new framework, supported by the DAO Council, streamlines engagement for contributors and builders.</p>
<p>The launch of our <strong>Push Grants Program V3</strong> empowered both, early-stage and established projects building innovative social, gaming, and mobile apps. This initiative has driven impressive results—increasing grant applications tenfold and multiplying our active grantees five times over since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Our Push DAO BD SubDAO Program now offers rewards ranging from <strong>$500–$1500</strong> for successful integrations of Push Notifications/Chat with DAOs, DeFi protocols, dApps, and other projects. Through our council and contributors' dedicated efforts, this program has generated over 80 qualified leads for our ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our revamped ambassador programs have reached new heights of influence, establishing a student hub at <strong>Texas Tech University</strong> and forming connections with event organizers across more than four continents.</p>
<p>As we prepare to launch Push Chain, our DAO stands ready to make a significant impact on the ecosystem and beyond. Our core team brings together professionals with cross-industry expertise, while our current and prospective grantees span key industry sectors.
Having achieved extraordinary growth in less than a year, we're positioned for even greater achievements in 2025.</p>
<p>With our coordinated event and marketing strategy for the launch in place, you can expect to see the DAO everywhere next year, driving the chain's progress.</p>
<p>With hundreds of new contributors, global exposures, quality grantees and a lot of love from the Push Fam community!</p>
<p>To continue our journey of Push DAO towards progressive decentralisation we introduced a new DAO framework, <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/push-dao-v2-push-dao-council/1631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push DAO V2</a>. This framework simplifies the process for contributors and builders to engage with the DAO, with the support of the DAO Council.</p>

<p>After years of building one of the first consumer apps in web3, one key takeaway we learnt, was the pressing need for a consumer app-centric chain capable of unifying the entire web3 ecosystem under a shared state.</p>
<p>This realization inspired the creation of <a href="https://push.org/chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chain</a> - <strong>a shared-state Layer 1 blockchain that unifies the settlement of all the incredible L1s, L2s, and L3s, enabling any user from any chain to access any app through one unified shared state.</strong></p>

<p>Push fam, we know you were extremely eager for Push Nodes, after its announcement early, this year.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the L1s, Push Chain too is a Proof Of Stake network - but with its own innovative flavour.</p>
<p>Push Chain splits the nodes into three types - Validator, Storage and Archival and enables a node governance smart contract that keeps track of all the nodes that are present in the network.</p>
<p><strong>Validator nodes</strong> - Responsible for validating transactions;</p>
<p><strong>Storage nodes</strong> - Dynamically shard data based on the hash of blockchain-agnostic addresses and store it; and</p>
<p><strong>Archival nodes</strong> - Maintain a full snapshot of all transactions on the network.</p>
<p>Push Chain also introduced  <strong>Node Registry Smart Contracts</strong> a key innovation that :</p>
<ul>
<li>Registers nodes.</li>
<li>Manage dynamic sharding.</li>
<li>Set replication factors.</li>
<li>Enable parallel validators that scale dynamically with the number of nodes in the network and thus achieve <strong>True Scale</strong>!</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="tldr">TLDR;<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#tldr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TLDR;" title="Direct link to TLDR;">​</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://push.org/chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chain</a> is a Proof of Stake shared state blockchain designed to support the development of hyper-scalable, consumer-centric, universal web3 applications by unifying settlement from any L1s, L2s and L3s.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="push architecture diagram" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/assets/images/image1-f0449ab66b8b7f04df4944bab35b03ff.webp" width="1600" height="1432" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Key Innovations and Superpowers of Push Chain include:</p>
<p>→ 1. <strong>Blockchain agnostic wallet addresses</strong></p>
<p>→ 2. <strong>Support Txns from any chain</strong></p>
<p>→ 3. <strong>Fee Abstraction</strong></p>
<p>→ 4. <strong>Wallet abstractio</strong></p>
<p>→ 5. <strong>Consumer (Unordered) and Traditional (Ordered) Transactions</strong></p>
<p>→ 6. <strong>True Scale: Sub Second Finality (speed)</strong></p>

<p>→ 8. <strong>True Scale: Dynamic Sharding (scaling read throughput)</strong></p>
<p>→ 9. <strong>Push ID</strong></p>
<p>→ 10. <strong>Universal Smart Contracts and Shared State</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these innovations and enhancements</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="innovations-by-push-chain">Innovations By Push Chain<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#innovations-by-push-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Innovations By Push Chain" title="Direct link to Innovations By Push Chain">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="1-blockchain-agnostic-wallet-addresses">1. Blockchain agnostic wallet addresses<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#1-blockchain-agnostic-wallet-addresses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Blockchain agnostic wallet addresses" title="Direct link to 1. Blockchain agnostic wallet addresses">​</a></h3>
<p>For Apps to support users from any chain and achieve <strong>universal compatibility</strong> - there must be a way to identify, interpret and transact with addresses incoming from various chains.</p>
<p>As a shared-state blockchain, Push Chain is designed to parse and handle blockchain addresses alongside the specific chains they originate from.</p>
<p>For instance, Push Chain can identify and support Solana, EVM, Cosmos and any other chain’s addresses.
To achieve this, Push Chain fully adopts <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAIP-10</a> blockchain-agnostic wallet addresses, enabling it to deduce the chain, network, and address associated with each transaction ensuring universal compatibility across multiple blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="2-support-txns-from-any-chain">2. Support Txns from any chain<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#2-support-txns-from-any-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Support Txns from any chain" title="Direct link to 2. Support Txns from any chain">​</a></h3>
<p>In addition to parsing addresses across various chains, Push Chain supports transactions from any wallet, regardless of the originating chain—be it Ethereum, Solana, or any other network.</p>
<p>Push Chain achieves this by accepting signed payload data and supporting the native signers of individual chains. Validator nodes then verify these signatures → conduct pre-transaction checks (such as fee validation) → and then admit the transactions to the network.</p>
<p>To clarify, a user doesn’t have to “bridge” to another chain to use our platform. Instead, the app becomes universal and available to all users of any chain.</p>
<p>Push Chain also introduces a new mechanism called <strong>Push ID</strong> to create a consistent and unified interface for users, no matter which wallet they use.</p>
<p><strong><em>More on Push ID below...</em></strong></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="3-fee-abstraction">3. Fee Abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#3-fee-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Fee Abstraction" title="Direct link to 3. Fee Abstraction">​</a></h3>
<p>With web3’s progression towards true interoperability, the necessity to hold native tokens for basic interactions creates unnecessary barriers in what should be a borderless ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Push Chain’s Fee Abstraction eliminates these digital borders, ensuring universal accessibility and removing the economic friction of owning native tokens for network fees.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Onchain Swappers</strong>: Fee contracts on every chain convert native tokens to cover fees automatically—no explicit swaps for Push Chain’s tokens are required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bulk Fee Payments</strong>: Lock and release fees in bulk, then send them to Push Chain directly in the transaction. This removes the bottleneck of waiting on a specific blockchain’s speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delegated Fees</strong>: Wallets or web3 apps can cover fees, enabling a web2-like UX where the “website” pays for the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These mechanisms bridge web2 paradigms into web3 enabling web2 UX in a web3 world -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay-for-content models</strong>: Apps like Facebook and Instagram cover user interaction fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Freemium models</strong>: Apps absorb user costs temporarily, enabling users to later pay in bulk for services after experiencing them for free (e.g., Spotify, Google Drive).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Push Chain makes these models possible, creating a frictionless experience and paving the way for building universal apps with borderless shared experiences.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="4-wallet-abstraction">4. Wallet abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#4-wallet-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Wallet abstraction" title="Direct link to 4. Wallet abstraction">​</a></h3>
<p>At a higher level, there are two user personas in web3:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Degens (aka existing web3 users)</strong> - Well accustomed to the fragmented UX, have app &amp; chain specific preferences for every on-chain activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Normies (aka new web3 users)</strong> - New or casual users unfamiliar with web3 complexities - Struggle with the manual and often complicated process of setting up a wallet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the rapid proliferation of L1s, L2s and L3s, the UX gap between Degens and Normies is widening, creating a disproportionate balance in user experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Push Chain’s Wallet Abstraction diminishes this divide by creating a balanced ground for every web3 user persona.</strong></p>
<p>Wallet abstraction provides a flexible, <strong>embeddable wallet experience</strong>, tailored to individual user journeys enabling any wallet from any chain to connect, interact and transact with Push Chain.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Web3 Users?</strong></p>
<p>Already using Ethereum, Solana, or another chain? Push Wallet lets you continue using your existing setup—no extra hoops. Combined with fee abstraction, transactions stay native to the source blockchain, making cross-chain use effortless.</p>
<p><strong>New Web3 Users (Web2 Normies)?</strong></p>
<p>Not web3-savvy? No problem. Just log in with an email or social account. Under the hood, the wallet uses sharding and pass keys to stay non-custodial but feels as simple and intuitive as web2.</p>
<p><strong>For users logging in via email or social platforms</strong>, Push Chain ensures security and non-custodial functionality through key sharding. The user’s credentials are divided into three encrypted shards stored across the Push Backend (trusted), local storage (encrypted via a passkey), and Push Chain (also encrypted via a passkey). This approach allows key reconstruction only when accessed by the user, providing a secure yet user-friendly experience that bridges the gap between web2 familiarity and web3 security.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="5-consumer-unordered-and-traditional-ordered-transactions">5. Consumer (Unordered) and Traditional (Ordered) Transactions<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#5-consumer-unordered-and-traditional-ordered-transactions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Consumer (Unordered) and Traditional (Ordered) Transactions" title="Direct link to 5. Consumer (Unordered) and Traditional (Ordered) Transactions">​</a></h3>
<p>Present web3 infra is heavily skewed towards financial apps that require strict ordering of transactions and precise state accuracy.
However consumer apps, on the other hand, are inclined towards more flexible, faster and parallel transaction needs.
Consumer apps are made of two primary elements where:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Order is necessary (user payments, financial instruments) and</em></li>
<li><em>Order is not critical (messages, comments or likes on a post, retweet, chat, email, gameplay, etc.).</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Traditional chains don’t provide the right experience for such use cases forcing consumer apps to make suboptimal compromises impacting their performance and usability.</p>
<p><strong><em>Could there be a way of supporting consumer actions in an unordered, parallel and yet decentralised manner?</em></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely yes! This is where <strong>Push Chain innovates a new transaction type - Consumer Transaction</strong>- which instantly unlocks non-financial, mixed-financial apps for web3 helping consumer apps reach faster PMF.</p>
<p>Managing hyper-scalable apps with thousands of parallel transactions on-chain - is not easy.
Push Chain makes it possible using its new innovation - <strong>True Scale</strong>.</p>
<p>With True Scale, Push Chain's network capacity and its read-write throughput grow organically, as more nodes join its consensus.
This enables parallel execution of thousands of consumer transactions, near-instant finality and quicker information storage and retrieval.</p>
<p>Here’s how the Push Chain achieves true scale.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="6-true-scale-sub-second-finality-speed">6. True Scale: Sub second finality (speed)<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#6-true-scale-sub-second-finality-speed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 6. True Scale: Sub second finality (speed)" title="Direct link to 6. True Scale: Sub second finality (speed)">​</a></h3>
<p>Push Chain splits the nodes into three types - <strong>Validator, Storage and Archival</strong> and enables a node governance smart contract that keeps track of all the nodes that are present in the network.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Validator Nodes</strong> - Responsible for validating transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage Nodes</strong> - Dynamically shard data based on the hash of blockchain-agnostic addresses and store it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Archival Nodes</strong> - Maintain a full snapshot of all transactions on the network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These role-specific nodes enable parallel validation to be done on any type of consumer transaction ensuring near-instant finality.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All txs (write or read) are attested by random validators/storage nodes ensuring that malicious nodes result in slashing.</p>
<p><strong>Node Registry Smart Contract:</strong> Push Chain employs a registry smart contract to register these nodes, manage dynamic sharding, set replication factors, and enable parallel validators that scale dynamically with the number of nodes in the network. This approach ensures linear scaling, allowing the network to handle increased read and write demands efficiently as it grows.</p>
<p>Because of these different nodes and smart contract setting up parallel validators, the tx sent to the network can land on any of the <em>‘n’</em> number of parallel validators which are then instantly moved to processing (250ms block), this is what enables sub-second finality for Push Chain.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="7-true-scale-parallel-validators-scaling-write-throughput">7. True Scale: Parallel validators (scaling write throughput)<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#7-true-scale-parallel-validators-scaling-write-throughput" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 7. True Scale: Parallel validators (scaling write throughput)" title="Direct link to 7. True Scale: Parallel validators (scaling write throughput)">​</a></h3>
<p>Push Chain achieves true scaling of write transactions, particularly for consumer transactions, where the consumer txs are packed in unordered blocks (or should we call them <strong>stateless blocks</strong>!? ).</p>
<p>Allowing these transactions to be processed through any active validator node promises near-instant finality, and the write throughput (or TPS) of the chain increases linearly as the number of nodes in the network grows.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="8-true-scale-dynamic-sharding-scaling-read-throughput">8. True Scale: Dynamic Sharding (scaling read throughput)<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#8-true-scale-dynamic-sharding-scaling-read-throughput" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 8. True Scale: Dynamic Sharding (scaling read throughput)" title="Direct link to 8. True Scale: Dynamic Sharding (scaling read throughput)">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Push Chain achieves true scaling of reading transactions by implementing dynamic sharding on storage nodes.</strong></p>
<p>Data chunks within each shard are mapped to blockchain-agnostic addresses and are dynamically redistributed as new storage nodes are added to the network.</p>
<p>In addition, the chain introduces a node governing smart contract onto which each node (regardless of the type) is registered before getting admitted to the network. Since this node-registry smart contract knows the number of nodes in the network, it is able to dynamically shard and assign data chunks and replication factors ensuring the network is fast and becomes faster in retrieving data as new nodes are added.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="9-push-id">9. Push ID<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#9-push-id" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 9. Push ID" title="Direct link to 9. Push ID">​</a></h3>
<p>In a universal chain like Push Chain - One essential element for bringing shared app experiences to users is the ability to track users’ on-chain identity - and not just their wallets.</p>
<p>One user may have multiple wallets, spanning various chains and ecosystems whether EVM or nonEVM.
This led us to create the unified Push ID, giving each user one identity that spans all their wallets, both EVM and non-EVM. Instead of tying interactions strictly to a single wallet, transactions are now accredited to a user’s Push ID.</p>
<p>The Push ID mapping allows for reverse lookups guaranteeing a consistent and unified interface for users, no matter which wallet they use. developers can fetch, index, and understand a user’s full spectrum of interactions across chains, all mapped to one identity.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="10-shared-state-and-universal-smart-contracts">10. Shared State and Universal Smart Contracts<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#10-shared-state-and-universal-smart-contracts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 10.

<p><strong>Shared State</strong></p>
<p>With Push ID and Any Chain Tx, we realized that accessing a wallet’s state across different blockchains is a game changer.</p>
<p>One thing that’s missing over here though was the ability to get the individual state of all the wallets which in essence will allow smart contracts to know the entire state of individual wallet(s) that are connected to the user. This feature is what we call a Shared state.</p>
<p><strong>Shared state allows Push Chain to access data from its own chain as well as supported external chains!</strong></p>
<p>With shared state, you can read wallet activities like NFTs, DeFi positions, governance participation, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>Universal Smart Contracts</strong></p>
<p>A shared state chain is essential to enable shared app experiences. This chain must have the ability to read the state of wallets across other chains, facilitating universal smart contracts and creating an ecosystem where users from any chain—or even web2—can interact seamlessly. Such a chain would provide shared settlement across both EVM and non-EVM chains, ushering in an era of universal apps and shared experiences.</p>
<p>Using shared state in VM, Push allows developers to write universal smart contracts with which universal app experiences become possible. Users, regardless of their origin—whether from any chain or ecosystem—can effortlessly interact with consumer apps that prioritize user engagement without regard to how or where they enter the system.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>Universal Smart Contracts and the ability to interact with all chains through Push Chain and represent our ultimate goal: Eliminating Web3 friction and delivering the best shared app experience possible.</strong></p>

<p>Push Protocol has come a long way! We’ve delivered over 140M notifications, built a community of 500K aggregate users, powered notifications for 500+ projects, and are known as the de facto leader in notifications and communications for web3.
We took the biggest and the most ambitious step in its history last week and have launched governance for its evolution to Push Chain, a shared state blockchain for building universal applications. It is a sharded Proof of Stake (PoS) chain built to allow developers to create user-centric app experiences and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, L3s.</p>
<p>The journey often matters more than the destination, and we couldn’t agree more. From our beginnings at ETHGlobal 2020, to becoming an EF alumnus, ranking as a top 5 project in Gitcoin Grants, securing funding from leading VCs and angels, inventing the communication stack for web3, and now launching a consumer-centric L1 to unify web3 - each milestone has shaped our path and brought us here. Buckle up, it's time to reminisce!</p>

<p>We started with an idea for Push Protocol and web3. The thesis was that protocols in web3 only interact with wallet addresses and thus it made sense to build a notification and communication system that can inform these wallets.</p>
<p>So the next time your DeFi loan is about to be liquidated, or a governance proposal comes up or your ENS is about to expire or someone comments on your web3 social, you get notified and can re-engage.</p>

<p>We were guided by EF to go and build the project out first at ETHGlobal, which is what we did and was the best thing that ever happened for us. We have made friends that are mentors, friends that are our investors, friends that helped us connect to relevant projects and friends that geeked out together on tech.</p>

<p>We have always said that Ethereum is where innovation has fostered traditionally and that is due to the community and the folks at Ethereum that go way beyond to help you in your journey.</p>
<p>EF has helped us, like countless other projects in guiding through the tranches of web3, especially when you are just getting started.</p>

<p>One of the best feelings we had was when we participated in Gitcoin Grants and the community came together to fund us out. This was in many ways the first check that we saw after we had started building Push (then EPNS).</p>
<p>There’s serenity in making something that gets loved by the people for whom you are building and is the best feeling that any entrepreneur can have. To us, these 214 contributors is what made everything we had done so far worthwhile!</p>

<p>Of course, the cherry on top was when Vitalik covered GR 7 in his <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2020/10/18/round7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>, and we among all the other top projects got a place in his blog, if not in his heart 😅.</p>

<p>Making it into Kernel was a dream come true. I still remember the joy I felt when we were selected. In our application form, there was a question: <b>What makes you special from any other project?</b> And what we wrote was <b>Every project that we have seen is special in its own ways, so nothing makes us special with respective to them but here’s why we feel we should be selected:</b> Technical and gap in communication, ux, etc</p>
<p>We submitted this but then stressed out on if we were rude or missed the context of the question. Thankfully, Vivek, Sachin and team embraced our web3 vibe wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>This was also the place where we made so many friends that I still reach out to for help now. This was the place where I first dmed Juan Benet, Met Sandeep, Alok (Standard VC), Thomas Klocanas and countless other folks that I look up to.</p>
<p>This in a way completed our journey of getting onboarded to web3 as we were now part of the vibes!</p>

<p>During this entire journey, we made friends who just wanted to help and the only thing we had to do was ask, or tweet, or dm. This was and still is why Ethereum is always home for us!</p>

<p>The next phase of our journey was to start sending web3 notifications and we had a chicken and egg problem over here. Notifications are useful for wallets to show if popular protocols are sending them but for popular protocols to embrace web3 notifs, wallets need to integrate them 😱.</p>
<p>We took a chance and reached out to some of the best and top protocols in the space back then, hint: they still are the leaders! They were the ones who helped us crack this chicken and egg problem and solidified our conviction on why web3 is the future - it’s because each one of them is trying to expand the boundaries of web3.</p>

<p>The momentum generated by Push till this point helped us get the attention of the best angels and VCs in the space. The success that we got due to the community, builders, web3 OGs coming and helping us together led us to secure our seed (and later series A) with folks that had some of the best mind share and vision for web3.</p>

<p>Push started getting noticed by OGs of web3, we were so humbled by people who we view as mentors and thought leaders writing about us. Push has reached the point where it had a chance to terraform web3, one notif at a time</p>

<p>We now realize that apart from inventing the communication protocol for web3, we also were building one of the first consumer app for it which was non-financial in nature and was driven by the utility it offered to average user than the 10x other financial apps promised (and thus, user was incentivized to learn web3 broken ux).</p>
<p>This realization helped us in paving forward an app that is useful and frictionless for the web3 user and enabled us to identify the features that we wanted as we moved towards decentralizing our notification nodes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="building-for-scalability-and-speed">Building for scalability and speed<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/evolution-of-push#building-for-scalability-and-speed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building for scalability and speed" title="Direct link to Building for scalability and speed">​</a></h3>
<p>We realized very quickly that notification unlike traditional transactions needs to be scalable. It needed an infra that can scale up and maintain speed. To enable this, we built out a solution involving dynamic sharding, ensuring that the solution scales up as more notifications and wallets join in.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="inventing-consumer-tx-by-accident">Inventing consumer tx by accident!<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/evolution-of-push#inventing-consumer-tx-by-accident" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Inventing consumer tx by accident!" title="Direct link to Inventing consumer tx by accident!">​</a></h3>
<p>While building our notification nodes for write throughput, ie: handling tens of thousands of parallel notifications. We came up with the architecture of having parallel validators, since having order in notifications was not required.</p>
<p>This paved the way for parallel validators where notifications can be sent to any validators which will then form stateless blocks (or unordered blocks). We didn’t know back then but we had unlocked a massive innovation in web3, having txs where ordering is not critical. This later formed the backbone of Push Chain’s speed and linear scalability.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="building-for-seamless-web3-ux">Building for seamless web3 UX<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/evolution-of-push#building-for-seamless-web3-ux" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building for seamless web3 UX" title="Direct link to Building for seamless web3 UX">​</a></h3>
<p>Another thing that we wanted our notification protocol to have was a seamless onboarding process where the user can just sign in once and then, just like web2, they are not required to sign things again and again. Our Chat Protocol and PGP implementation helped us realize and solve for the most seamless web3 UX. Later on, this learning was transformed into wallet and fee abstraction for Push Chain.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="building-for-unification-of-web3">Building for unification of web3<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/evolution-of-push#building-for-unification-of-web3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building for unification of web3" title="Direct link to Building for unification of web3">​</a></h3>
<p>And finally, we wanted this to be the communication protocol of web3, where notifications and chat can come to Push as a universal hub. Where, protocols from Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Aptos, or any other EVM or non-EVM are able to come together in a seamless interoperable way.</p>
<p>This is not bridging, as bridging moves funds or assets from one chain to another. But, instead it’s unification or having a universal hub. A place where users from all chains come together. This feature is what was transformed to Push Chain as being the universal hub for all chains, where transactions from any chain are supported, where shared state of all wallets are available, where all L1s, L2s and L3s can come together and use Push as a shared settlement layer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="rebranding-to-become-the-communication-protocol-of-web3">Rebranding to become the communication protocol of web3<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/evolution-of-push#rebranding-to-become-the-communication-protocol-of-web3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rebranding to become the communication protocol of web3" title="Direct link to Rebranding to become the communication protocol of web3">​</a></h3>
<p>We started building notifications for web3 under the brand of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) which made sense when we started since Apple also names their notification service as Apple Push Notification Service (APNS).</p>
<p>But as we dived deep and started building the features for enabling notifications, chat. We quickly became aware that a non-Ethereum developer might be confused by the name EPNS. Thus, we decided to rebrand to Push, we picked this name because:</p>
<ul>
<li>We were now placed to become the communication protocol of web3, so <b>Ethereum</b> had to go from <b>Ethereum Push Notification Service</b>.</li>
<li>We were not doing just notification, but instead had chat among other communication tools so <b>Notification</b> had to go from <b>Push Notification Service.</b></li>
<li>And lastly, we were not a service but a decentralized protocol of web3, so <b>Service</b> had to go from <b>Push Service</b>.</li>
<li>Leading us to rebrand to <b>Push</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Push notifications protocol came a long way from its humble beginnings to now. Today, we have powered hundreds of millions of notifications sent to web3 users across the globe.</p>

<p>During building for our vision of the most perfect consumer app and the decentralized notification protocol and nodes out. We eventually realized that what we have built instead is far more significant and solves for the seamless web3 that we all dream of.</p>
<p>This realization is what turned into our shared state blockchain - Push Chain, which while being an L1, is not just another L1 as it’s built to be used by users of any other chain without them needing to switch or bridge to this chain. It’s the future of web3 built for unification, consumer and universal apps and seamless onboarding.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="launching-push-chain-proposal-and-devnet-">Launching Push Chain proposal and Devnet 🚀<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/evolution-of-push#launching-push-chain-proposal-and-devnet-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Launching Push Chain proposal and Devnet 🚀" title="Direct link to Launching Push Chain proposal and Devnet 🚀">​</a></h3>
<p>This has led us to launching our proposal of Push Chain, which just to recap is a shared state L1 blockchain for shared app experiences. Push Chain enables txs from any chain (Solana, Eth, EVM, or non-EVM) with fast finality of &lt;1 second and can scale infinitely as nodes increase, supporting tens of thousands of parallel transactions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Push Chain introduces groundbreaking features including:</li>
<li>Ability to do any chain tx</li>
<li>Introduces a new tx type - Consumer transaction (order not important)</li>
<li>Provides wallet and fee abstraction for a seamless user experience</li>
<li>Enables true scale with parallel validators and dynamic sharding</li>
<li>Able to do &lt;1 second finality</li>
<li>Utilizes universal smart contracts - capable of accessing the state of a wallet belonging to a different chain</li>
</ul>

<p>Web 3 is growing at lightning speed!</p>
<p>Hundreds of L1s, Thousands of L2s and soon Tens of thousands of L3s!!</p>
<p>While striving to make systems more scalable, decentralized and secure, we risk overlooking a crucial goal - <strong>To expand the boundaries of web3 for all users.</strong></p>
<p>And with increasing fragmentation coupled with complex pre-requisites to interact on-chain, inflexible infrastructure for consumer apps, and a lack of chain unification, the barrier to entry is rising, leading to the emergence of more closed and isolated systems.</p>
<p>But not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing Push Chain - A shared state blockchain for shared app experiences!</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-push-chain">What is Push Chain?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/consumer-apps-that-can-be-built-on-push-chain#what-is-push-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Push Chain?" title="Direct link to What is Push Chain?">​</a></h2>

<p>Push Chain is a shared state blockchain for universal applications. It is designed to allow <strong>transactions from any chain</strong> (ETH, Solana, EVM, non-EVM), has <strong>&lt;1s fast finality</strong> and has <strong>true scalability</strong> (read and write throughput increases as the number of nodes increases).</p>
<p>It introduces some ground breaking innovations such as <strong>consumer txs</strong> (order not important), <strong>parallel validators and dynamic sharding</strong> and <strong>universal smart contracts</strong>. The result is a layer 1 with the ability to become a shared settlement layer for all L1s 🤝 L2s 🤝 L3.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Push Chain Architecture" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/assets/images/pcoverview-ef4ca9321077a31148211c9aec3f84c2.webp" title="Push Chain Architecture" width="1600" height="1432" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Push Chain is a sharded, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain that features different types of nodes—validators, storage nodes, and archival nodes—each optimized for specific roles and responsibilities to ensure high efficiency. This design gives the chain fast finality of less than one second.</p>
<p>In brief, <strong>Validator</strong> nodes handle the role of writing transactions and are able to do so in parallel. <strong>Storage</strong> nodes, which are dynamically sharded, fetch transactions from the network. And <strong>Archival</strong> nodes provide a complete snapshot of the blockchain.</p>
<p>Push Chain also introduces several key innovations in web3. At launch, these include <strong>consumer transactions</strong> (these are txs where order is not critical), <strong>Push ID</strong>, which maps multiple EVM and non-EVM accounts and <strong>wallet and fees abstraction</strong>.</p>
<p>In later phases, Push Chain will introduce <strong>shared state</strong> and <strong>universal smart contracts</strong>. These features will enable smart contracts on Push Chain to access the state of both EVM and non-EVM wallets connected to a single user.</p>
<p>The result is <strong>universal applications</strong> for web3. In this paradigm, instead of being a user of "Uniswap on Ethereum," "Uniswap on Polygon," or "Uniswap on Arbitrum," a person simply becomes a <strong>user of Uniswap</strong>.</p>

<p>Push Chain addresses specific gaps in the existing blockchains, such as interoperability, shared app experiences, enabling new app experiences, and scalability. While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in their own eco-system and an aggregator to unite these chains are needed.</p>
<p>Push Chain’s focus is on being a <strong>shared state chain</strong> for universal applications acting as a unifying layer where all chains can come together and use PC as universal hub or do settlement between them.</p>
<p>PC offers a new paradigm of web3 that works from <strong>any chain.</strong> for <strong>any user.</strong> and is suitable for <strong>any app.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Any Chain Txs and Blockchain Agnostic Wallet Addresses</strong></p>
<p>As a shared-state blockchain, Push Chain adopts <strong>CAIP-10 standards</strong> (shoutout to <a href="https://x.com/pedrouid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Follow Pedrouid on X">@pedrouid</a>, allowing it to parse the chain, network, and address of each transaction. This ensures true interoperability across multiple blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Txs (unordered) and Traditional Txs (ordered)</strong></p>
<p>Push introduces a new type of transaction that we define as <strong>consumer transactions</strong>.</p>
<p>When you look at consumer apps of web2, you quickly notice that they are made of two components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transactions where order is necessary</strong> (e.g., user payments, financial instruments).</li>
<li><strong>Transactions where order is not critical</strong> (e.g., messages, comments or likes on a post, retweets, chats, emails, gameplay, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>These unordered actions dominate consumer apps, but traditional chains don’t provide the right experience for them.</p>
<p>Push Chain introduces <strong>unordered transactions</strong>, where order is not critical. These transactions can be sent to any of the validators running on the network to be processed.</p>
<p>This innovation will have a significant impact on web3, enabling consumer apps that combine financial, mixed-financial, and non-financial transactions with the same scalability and speed seen in web2.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Validators &amp; Dynamic Sharding</strong></p>
<p>Push Chain uses a <strong>node governor smart contract</strong>, which registers all the different types of nodes. This governor contract not only registers nodes but also keeps track of the number of validator, storage, and archival nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>It adjusts the replication factor.</li>
<li>Assigns address chunks to shards.</li>
<li>Enables parallel validators to process transactions, allowing the chain to scale linearly with the number of nodes added to the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach achieves <strong>true scale</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet and Fee Abstraction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wallet abstraction</strong> provides a flexible, embeddable wallet experience, tailored to individual user journeys while preserving decentralization. This abstraction simplifies the user experience (UX) for both existing and new web3 users.</p>
<p><strong>For Existing Web3 Users</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you're already using Ethereum, Solana, or another chain, the <strong>Push Chain wallet</strong> allows you to continue using your current setup—no extra hoops.</li>
<li>Combined with <strong>fee abstraction</strong>, transactions stay native to the source blockchain, making cross-chain use effortless.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For New Web3 Users (Web2 Normies)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not web3-savvy? No problem. Just log in with an email or social account.</li>
<li>Under the hood, the wallet uses sharding and passkeys to stay non-custodial but feels as simple and intuitive as web2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shared State and Universal Smart Contracts</strong></p>
<p>With <strong>Push ID</strong>, the state of a non-Push wallet and multiple wallets across any chain is mapped to a single user. This ensures that the user's state across all blockchains is known.</p>
<p>Combining this capability with <strong>universal smart contracts</strong> unlocks innovations that web3 hasn’t seen before, enabling the era of universal apps.</p>

<p>Phase 1 lays the groundwork of building universal consumer apps focusing on introducing a scalable, chain agnostic, and unified layer capable of handling any types of consumer apps including financial but also non-financial and mixed-financial apps. The features in this phase include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling true scale apps</li>
<li>Allowing transactions from any chain</li>
<li>Introducing Consumer transactions (where ordering is not important)</li>
<li>Push VM for complex on-chain applications</li>
<li>Fee abstraction</li>
<li>Wallet abstraction</li>
<li>Push ID to map multiple EVM and non-EVM wallet to a single identity</li>
<li>Enabling PoS (Proof of Stake) with dynamic sharding and parallel validators</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 2 centers on facilitating seamless interoperability between chains which is a stepping stone in enabling universal smart contracts to usher in universal apps.
This phase introduces a solver network capable of instant cross-chain transactions, both financial and non-financial based. The non-financial distinction is crucial as it enables all payloads to move instantly between Push-connected chains, benefiting consumer applications like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media</li>
<li>Marketplaces</li>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Other consumer-facing use cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 3 is about introducing shared state and the launch of universal smart contracts, enabling true shared state and universal apps.</p>

<p>The term shared state means that Push Chain not only has read and write access to its own state but also has read-only access to all the other supported chains’ states. This is the final and most imperative phase of Push Chain, and it enables <strong>universal apps</strong> that seamlessly function across multiple chains.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Push Chain Universal App" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/assets/images/pcuniversalapp-b1592bc5a870b8a52a544d01c1702efe.webp" title="Push Chain - Shared State Chain for Universal Apps" width="1600" height="1213" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Push Chain achieves shared state by leveraging Push ID, which maps multiple EVM and non-EVM wallets to a single identity. This allows for a single user to have a single state across all chains, enabling true shared state.</p>
<p>The whole vision of universal apps with shared states is achieved through 4 core features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fee and Wallet Abstraction:</strong>
With wallet abstraction, Push Chain aims to enable seamless user onboarding without going through the manual and complicated procedure of setting up a web3 wallet.
With fee abstraction, the chain eliminates the friction of requiring to hold native gas strictly in the wallet in use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seamless Interoperability:</strong>
With Phase 2 of its roadmap, the chain aims to establish seamless interoperability between chains to enable cross-chain features in the apps.</p>
<p>The interoperability will be enabled using a solver network capable of instant cross-chain transactions to ensure better UX. The network will be designed to move not only value but also arbitrary payloads that seamlessly transfer smart contract calls to other chains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Any Chain Transaction:</strong>
With fee abstraction layer and interoperability, the chain is then able to provide the capability for users and apps on this chain to seamlessly initiate transactions for any chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unified VM:</strong>
A unified VM that enables complex universal smart contract logic that is able to execute cross chain actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining these 4 main pillars, the chain aims to achieve shared app experiences and unlock a plethora of new cross-chain and universal app use cases in every domain of web3.</p>

<p>As a new layer 1, Push Chain would have its own native token with tokenomics suited to the functioning, maintenance, and security of a blockchain.</p>
<p>The governance proposal for Push Chain introduces the layer 1 as a potential direction for the Push ecosystem. If approved, Push would then introduce tokenomics for feedback and discussion among the community.</p>
<p>Push Chain would need a new token because an L1 token has a fundamentally different design and purpose than a token designed to incentivize the notifications protocol. A priority for Push Chain tokenomics is to ensure that all Push Protocol $PUSH holders are able to migrate their tokens to the Push Chain native token (ticker TBD).</p>
<p><strong>Note: Push Chain mainnet is not live, nor is any token related to Push Chain besides Push Protocol <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH on CMC">$PUSH</a>.</strong> Any communication about Push Chain will come directly from the Push company website and X / Twitter handle.</p>

<p>Push Chain is a natural evolution of Push Protocol's vision. Current services of Push Protocol remain a priority, ensuring they continue to improve while benefiting from the new infrastructure.</p>
<p>Today's push notification and chat protocols will benefit significantly from being built on top of Push Chain. A dedicated section of the team will focus on maintaining and enhancing these protocols, ensuring they remain the de-facto standard in their respective domains.</p>
<p>By aligning with Push Chain, notifications and chat sent through the protocols will be processed as transactions on the chain. This integration not only enables these protocols to accrue value but also marks the beginning of a new chapter in their evolution, further enhancing their utility and impact within the web3 ecosystem.</p>

<p>The Push Chain Network, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain designed for consumer-centric applications, offers an innovative approach to scalability and usability in the decentralized space. By leveraging features like dynamic sharding, parallel block execution, and true scale, Push Chain promises a seamless environment for universal applications. This blog explores the benchmarking results of Push Chain under varying node configurations, providing insights into how the network behaves and scales as the number of nodes increases.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Validator Nodes:</strong> Responsible for handling transaction validation and serving as the primary interface for client interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Nodes:</strong> Tasked with storing validated transactions in a sharded manner for optimized data access and storage efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Archival Nodes:</strong> Maintain a comprehensive record of all network transactions, enabling historical data access and providing support for applications like blockchain explorers.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Note: While the roles described above provide a high-level overview, nodes in the Push Chain Network perform significantly more complex tasks, including dynamic sharding, transaction propagation, and ensuring data consistency across the network.</p>

<p>The benchmarking tests were conducted in controlled environments with different node configurations:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="environment-configurations">Environment Configurations<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-984/blog/parallel-validators-and-dynamic-sharding#environment-configurations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Environment Configurations" title="Direct link to Environment Configurations">​</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Configuration 1</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>5 Validator Nodes</strong>, <strong>8 Storage Nodes</strong>, <strong>5 Archival Nodes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>2 CPU cores</strong> allocated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Configuration 2</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>10 Validator Nodes</strong>, <strong>8 Storage Nodes</strong>, <strong>5 Archival Nodes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>4 CPU cores</strong> allocated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Configuration 3</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>20 Validator Nodes</strong>, <strong>8 Storage Nodes</strong>, <strong>5 Archival Nodes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>8 CPU cores</strong> allocated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The benchmarks primarily evaluate the performance of the <strong>validator nodes</strong>, which serve as the gateway for client interactions. However, since validator nodes interact with storage nodes and archival nodes internally, the results effectively reflect the performance of the entire network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚡ <strong>Note on</strong> <strong>Controlled Environment:</strong> All of these benchmarks were performed in a controlled internal network environment. As a result, any network lags or latency typically observed in real-world public networks were kept to a minimum, ensuring that the results reflect the network’s inherent capabilities rather than external factors. This setup allows for more accurate measurement of the Push Chain Network’s performance under varying configurations without the interference of significant network delays.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>📊 <strong>Note on CPU Scaling:</strong> In order to simulate a decentralized network more realistically, the number of CPU cores allocated scales proportionally with the number of nodes. For instance, 2 CPU cores are allocated for 5 validator nodes, 4 CPU cores for 10 nodes, and 8 CPU cores for 20 nodes. This approach mirrors how resources would likely be distributed in a decentralized system, where each node operator contributes computational resources to the network.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>⚙️ <strong>Note on Node Configuration:</strong> For simplicity and consistency, the number of <strong>Storage Nodes</strong> and <strong>Archival Nodes</strong> is kept constant at <strong>8</strong> and <strong>5</strong>, respectively, across all configurations. This ensures that the focus remains on evaluating the performance of the <strong>Validator Nodes</strong> and their interactions with the network, without introducing additional variables.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> As the number of nodes increased, the Push Chain Network demonstrated significantly improved scalability, particularly in <strong>Configuration 3</strong>. This configuration exhibited the best performance across most tests, showcasing the network’s ability to scale efficiently without sacrificing speed. The benefits of <strong>dynamic sharding</strong> ensured that even as the network grew, the system maintained fast response times, handling multiple concurrent threads effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Bottlenecks:</strong> While performance remained strong as the node count grew, the network did experience timeouts and errors at higher thread counts. This indicates that, although the system can scale, there are throughput limits at extreme loads. However, <strong>Configuration 3</strong> was able to handle a larger volume of requests compared to smaller configurations, validating the advantages of scaling up the number of validator nodes. Given that the <strong>goal of the Push Chain Network</strong> is to scale up to <strong>100,000 validator nodes</strong>, the throughput limits observed at high thread counts are just the beginning. As the network grows, these limits would become significantly larger, making the network capable of handling a vastly higher volume of requests.</li>
<li><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> The results illustrate how the Push Chain Network becomes more scalable as nodes are added, making it a robust solution for future consumer-centric applications where network demands will increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>These benchmarks offer valuable insights into the scaling behaviour of the Push Chain Network, demonstrating its readiness to support growing adoption and demanding workloads. Moving forward, continued optimizations in areas like transaction propagation, parallel processing, and sharding will further enhance the network’s performance, enabling it to handle even higher loads.</p>
