The Latam Fam was in the house!\\n\\n<VideoContainer>\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" style={{ borderRadius: \\"32px\\" }} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LLiH-yDlqDY\\" title=\\"Friday #PUSH Call 21 – Vamos LATAM Fam 🧉💃 ft.

We discussed why Argentina became a hub for innovation due to all challenges people face on a daily basis. And we got the Alpha as to what he will be talking about during his talk in ETH Latam (<b><i>don’t miss it!</i></b>), and his “toy project” that as per Harsh “will change the world in the future!”.\\n\\nWe couldn’t miss the opportunity to get Mariano’s opinion on one of the most anticipated events in crypto — the <b>Ethereum Merge.</b> Looking forward for this moment to come!\\n\\nNext in line — <b>Juan David</b> from the Colombia community 🇨🇴 brought the latino style into the conversation and decided to spanglish things up! He shared with the things he’s been up to for the past year and his participation in organizing DevCon Bogota.\\n\\nWith the ETH Latam communities reunited in this space, the conversation took an interesting shift into discussing the challenges & opportunities for the Latam region and the role Ethereum and the blockchain technologies play.\\n\\nAnd in the blink of an eye we came to our last guest of the Latam Fam CryptoChica 🇦🇷. Given her vast contributions in creating educational content for the Spanish speaking community, we wanted to know “Who is <b>CryptoChica</b> and what has been her journey in the web3 space? — “Saludos a DeFi Latam”\\n\\nWe talked about the Quadratic Funding initiative that just started for projects aligned with Public Goods in Argentina, and soon to start in other countries.\\n\\nTo finalize, all our guests took a minute to talk about what everyone can expect when you come to Argentina and the ETH Latam event 🎉.\\n\\nIt was definitely a very fun time with friends and the Latam Fam in the house, we can’t wait to see you all in the Argentina.\\n\\nTill next Friday Push!\\n\\n— The EPNS team"}}');
