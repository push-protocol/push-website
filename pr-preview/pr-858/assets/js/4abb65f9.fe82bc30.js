We wanted to take a moment to say **Thank you** for the amazing support! We ❤️ you 3000, hope you know that 🙂.\\n\\nThe genesis of $PUSH happened few days ago, [0xf418588522d5dd018b425E472991E52EBBeEEEEE](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf418588522d5dd018b425e472991e52ebbeeeeee), following our $PUSH [token generation event](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/announcing-the-epns-push-token-generation-event-4d1699e716f5).\\n\\n## Let’s do a Recap\\n\\nJust a couple of weeks ago, we announced the completion of our 10x oversubscribed [extended seed](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-closes-10x-oversubscribed-extended-seed-round-ae03c60ae0f8) round, which followed our [initial seed round](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ethereum-push-notification-service-successfully-raises-750k-usd-in-seed-round-bec41eadd84d). We raised $1.41 Million USD from the 2 rounds with support from top blockchain VC’s and Web3 angel investors. A few highlights of our journey so far.\\n\\n- We’re backed by 35+ top VCs and Web3 Angel investors including **Balaji Srinivasan**, **True Ventures**, **Binance** **Labs**, **IOSG**, **BitScale**, **Bixin**, **Kenneth** **Ng** (Ethereum Foundation), **Sandeep** **Nailwal** (Co-founder, Polygon), **Mariano** **Conti**, **Anthony** **Sassano**, **DeFiDad**, **Ajit** **Tripathi**, **Scott** **Moore** (Gitcoin Co-founder), **Ravindra** (Frontier Wallet), **Preethi** **Kasireddy**, **Auryn** **Macmillan** (Gnosis), **Luka** **Sucic**, **TheLAO**, **MetaCartel** **VC**, **Fourth** **Revolution** **Capital**, **Moonwhale** **Ventures**, **D64** **Ventures**, **LD** **Capital**, **BR** **Capital** and [more](https://epns.io/).\\n\\n![First Image of The Wind Behind EPNS](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n- We are grateful for the support and guidance we’ve received from our Advisors.
