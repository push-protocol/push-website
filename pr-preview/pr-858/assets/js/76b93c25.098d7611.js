This marks one of the most important milestones in the 2021 roadmap, as it enables & ensures EPNS is ready to support cross-chain interoperability.\\n\\nJust a couple weeks later, we came up with a follow up on a Q3 Roadmap item that goes hand by hand with the EPNS Protocol v1— we turned **_Web3 Communication ON_**! with our [**Push Nodes P2P**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1463556448919568387?s=20) 🌐\\n\\n![First image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nAnother important set of activities took place this month to ensure we keep our protocol up-to-date to meet the greatest standards:\\n\\n- Spam Box 📥 functionality progressing well. More updates soon 👀\\n- The Showrunners framework is now fully validated against our Audited Protocol v1 contract 📦\\n- The Showrunners Framework (Staging) is now fully functional with off-chain features. Users can now opt-in/opt-out by just signing a transaction with their wallets, and also **notifications** are being sent through off-chain transactions!\\n- The entire Staging environment is now fully connected against Kovan! We are currently in the last phase of testing and validation. The MobileApp and PUSH Nodes were successfully migrated to Kovan as well.\\n\\nWe decided to use this important task, and confirm our migration scripts are rock solid. The Testnet migration was a success and now we are one step closer to Mainnet launch!\\n\\nAnother really important event this month was our participation in the Solana Breakpoint event. Why? We took it as a challenge and as an opportunity to put EPNS cross-chain compatibility to test by running EPNS on Solana. Test passed!✅ ([Check it out here](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1461016539176390659?s=20))\\n\\n# **Collaborations** 📺\\n\\nThis month we are thrilled to announce the addition of three new frens to the EPNS fam 👋🏽:\\n\\n- [**Timeswap**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1455535310713012229?s=20): to create a hassle-free experience for lenders and borrowers.\\n- [**Fabwelt**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1461334807024050187?s=20): to bring Push notifications to crypto gaming.\\n- [**IoTex**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1458845936373821442?s=20): to help Connect the Physical and Digital Worlds of the Internet of Trusted Things\\n\\nAdditionally, lots of progress has been made in many of the channels we are currently working on in preparation to release them LIVE right after our Mainnet launch.
