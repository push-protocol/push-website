      children: "Dan — Umm so yeah, just a real quick background because I’ve probably given the history a million times, so yeah i am a local of the bay area of california and i was more of a entertainer and actually i was making videos and stuff in my youth and then eventually you know from editing videos into programming apps and i eventually made friends with my co-founder Davis and he went to this meetup and learned about ethereum, we were co-working at that time and so we were talking a whole bunch about it and talking about how could you interact with an application where there’s no single server, where there’s no secrets anymore, users have to hold their own keys and you know we had some ideas then, and it sounded really easy at that time and so we were like “okay, we’ll make this real quick” and he had an initial version that was entirely in the browser, it was like a browser in a browser which was extremely ambitious but eventually we dialed it back to just being a browser extension and now we also have a mobile client and here we are and it’s almost 6 years later or i think from his original starting on the project it’s like 7 years and 6 years since we first shared it with the public and it’s changed a lot but not as much as i had liked and i’m sure everybody has a million features they’d like umm i think we really kind of unearthed a new product’s category, The wallet. I think the closest thing we had was like a password manager maybe but a wallet isn’t just typing in passwords, it’s actually like potentially giving individual consent you know, it’s got not just your account’s but it’s got the ability to perform actions on your behalf and the websites don’t have that ability anymore and so this real inversion of control, so now whenever you perform an action on a website it has a opportunity to ask the user for permission and so we get to be this cool little service on a person’s computer that gets their permission for stuff so i sometimes think about it as a little digital lawyer who sits on your computer and tells you “this website would like to do that, is that what you wanna do?” and you know like we are trying to then we end up trying to really bridge that gap because we have have put you know something some consent between them and somebody else’s idea of what to do with their money and yeah so that’s like a little micro background on the product category and obviously this last year and and um we did a lot to facilitate layer two networks we added apis that let make it easier to switch networks from an application so users can now use multi-chain applications without entering config values and settings like just by con sensing to things you can use applications that are cross-chain and we are not stopping there um we really do have a vision of the wallet as a truly multi-chain thing where people have accounts of all types people have different security preferences you know not everyone’s going to probably use their own um hotkeys for all of their assets you know obviously we have hardware wallets today um and there are also contract accounts today and now we’ve got you know a distributed signing you know multi-party compute algorithms and um i think there’s going to be a lot more and so we’re trying to build the wallet in a way that can facilitate ongoing experimentation in in all of those ways so that people really have the ability to choose the risk profiles that make sense for them um and so anyways it’s a obviously grown to be a much bigger project than we possibly imagined when we first heard of ethereum it sounded like it would be like rails like you write your logic now you make an app ta-da but the truth is there’s just so much more to it than that and um it’s been quite a ride and clearly there’s uh quite a bit more to go."

      children: "Dan — Uh yeah so something that’s cool that uh that probably just happened a couple days ago on january 18th if everything goes according to schedule um we will have launched uh something that we’re calling metamask flask it’s um a special developer distribution of metamask where we’re going to experiment with features that are a little experimental a little more a little more bold than we would usually push to all users and so developers are welcome to install flask as their as their metamask driver as long as they know how to backup their keys and are willing to do a little uh coding to um you know if they if they write an application that relies on it uh just assume that apis will break so you might have to yeah we’re we’re saying flask is for developers um we’re going to break apis but we’re going to do some fun crazy things and the first fun crazy thing we’re going to do on flask is we’ve got a version of snaps we started realizing that something this big inorder to get it to production needed to not be a long-running branch but needed to be built in a way where we can turn it on with a single flip of a switch and so that’s what flask is every feature on flask we can trivially transition into production and so uh in in flask we’ve got a basic version of snaps the first version is very simple it allows you to provide apis to sites uh display confirmations to users or alerts if you’re maybe something like epns as well as perform some cryptographic information with keys that are derived from the user’s secret recovery phrase so long term we’re going to be adding a lot of really cool apis to snaps letting you represent snaps-based assets in the user’s wallet ,adding new account types showing warnings or endorsements on contracts and and much more we have a lot of things that we think this is going to be useful for so we we really think that this is going to unlock um multiple layers of innovation that just were not open to before like in the past you had to build a whole new wallet from scratch if you wanted to do a lot of these things and so uh it’s been a lot of work it’s basically been the equivalent of building a new operating system kernel um so i hope that people can understand and be patient with us um but i think the reward is going to be great i think we’re going to make the wallet a much more versatile um tool"
