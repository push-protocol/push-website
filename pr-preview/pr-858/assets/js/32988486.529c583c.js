This partnership marks a significant step towards empowering stakeholders at ElementFi.\\n\\nFor ElementDAO users, you can opt-in to [receive notifications👉 here](http://app.push.org/channels?channel=0x349da2A6825284E9E181D46D664b95aecE86da56)\\n\\n## Push X ElementDAO\\n\\nDecentralized notifications, powered by Push, establish a direct line of communication between ElementDAO and its ELFI holders. This seamless flow of information ensures that ElementDAO members stay informed, empowered, and ready to actively participate in the decision-making processes that shape the project’s future.\\n\\nBy leveraging Push, ElementDAO members will receive timely notifications that keep them up to date on crucial developments within the ecosystem such as when:\\n\\n- A new proposal has made it to the voting phase\\n- 24 hours are left to cast a vote on a proposal\\n- Voting results are out\\n\\nThe use cases for notifications extend beyond governance proposals. Users can also expect to receive ad-hoc announcements, updates on new feature launches, maintenance windows, and various other project-related communications in the future.\\n\\nWe’re extremely excited to be collaborating with the ElementDAO team and are looking forward to setting a new standard for DeFi communications. We also look forward to future integrations with other DELV products — Harsh Rajat, CEO & Founder of Push Protocol\\n\\nWe’re inviting ElementDAO members to embrace this new era of empowerment and actively participate in shaping the future of ElementDAO and the ElementFi.
