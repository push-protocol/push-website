We thought Week 2 would give us a breather as we felt we conquered the world! but oh boy! @Gitcoin had so much for week 2, week 1 feels like a distant past.\\n\\n![Cover Image of EPNS Update: Gitcoin Week 2](./image-1.gif)\\n\\nWeek 2 shifted us to getting to know hyper-sprinting better, we call it [Deepwork The Reawakening](https://deepwork.studio/) with Andrej. Everything was setup just right, Andrej setup the [Miro](https://medium.com/u/962c48776891?source=post_page-----2c84b9cdbd0--------------------------------) boards with every minute details for us, there were feedback walls, what to do with those walls, how to synthesize those feedback and essentially every step to follow. Vivek set the mood to awesome [ambient music](https://youtu.be/b5H3b_Hh0Lw) and the stage was set for 250 Kernel peeps to dive into.\\n\\nThat is until all of us went into Miro at once and broke it! Yes, if you have been following the story so far, you would know that one thing we truly are the masters of is [stress testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_testing) the heck out of any awesome tool which we come across. As with all the things we are getting taught in Kernel, one thing which all our mentors (and I would like to think) follow is the ability to get back on the feet whenever something doesn\u2019t go as per plan (or more whenever you get every kernel fellow in a single room). A few minutes later, we had another process and everyone was collaborating, learning and having fun. Imagine, 250 peeps doing things all together and all at once, it\u2019s a beautiful chaos that\u2019s so beautiful to see!\\n\\nOur only sorrow is we weren\u2019t able to interact with [Austin Thomas Griffith](https://medium.com/u/610daeab315b?source=post_page-----2c84b9cdbd0--------------------------------), we absolutely love his wacky videos\u2026 shoutout to Austin if you are reading this!
