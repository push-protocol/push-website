While rDai took the very first step in streaming Compound interest in DeFi, programmable cashflows enable many new use cases in other avenues like crypto payrolls, subscriptions or even dispensing weekly rewards at scale!\\n\\nFinancial operations like subscriptions, salaries, rewards, and any composable stream of value usually require many repetitive and expensive transactions to be processed on-chain. Enter [Superfluid Protocol](http://www.superfluid.finance/), an Ethereum based framework that creates transparency into the flow of any recurring transactions, allowing a clear view into the flow and stream of money. By publishing a single transaction, a user could agree to transfer 10 DAI per month in a constant stream. With every second, a tiny amount of DAI will flow between the two wallets, without any need for gas or any further transactions by either the sender or the receiver.\\n\\nWe\u2019re thrilled to announce our partnership with the Superfluid team to further empower the protocol by adding the communication layer powered by Ethereum Push Notification Protocol. This will enable users to not only receive stream but also decentralized notifications to their wallet addresses informing them about important information about any particular money stream along with several other important communications.\\n\\nOur pilot program with Superfluid will consist of:\\n\\n- Exploring adding automated notification capabilities triggered by the basic functions available in the Superfluid Protocol. Such as: Starting, Editing and Cancelling a stream.\\n- Working with the Superfluid team to enable technical discussion towards building a decentralized communication layer that is scalable and powerful.\\n\\nSuperfluid adds a new building block that is poised to change the game and allow builders to create a whole new generation of DeFi applications. We are honored with this amazing opportunity of working together with the Superfluid team in developing **Real Time Finance**.\\n\\n> \u201cEnabling a direct communication channel between dApps and users is crucial, but has always been a tricky problem due to the reluctance of users to associate their email and ethereum account. EPNS solves this brilliantly, and will allow us to drastically improve our User Experience.\u201d \u2014 _Francesco Renzi, CEO Superfluid_\\n\\n**About Superfluid**\\n\\nSuperfluid is a new DeFi primitive that automates recurring transactions, the protocol introduces a series of building blocks for web3 developers to enable real-time finance. Superfluid smart contract framework unlocks idle capital by enabling users to move assets on-chain and apply predefined rules called \u201cagreements\u201d to asset transfers. Superfluid only requires one on-chain transaction to open, edit or close a subscription, greatly decreasing the cognitive and administrative efforts that would have been involved for other types of recurring payments.
