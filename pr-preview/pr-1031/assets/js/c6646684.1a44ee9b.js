These people have lent us their time and their knowledge to support our growth and our journey to provide the core notification layer for the decentralized economy. Thank you to each and every one of them!\\n\\n![First= Image of EPNS Ends H1 2021 with 25 Collaborations and $118m Volume on Uniswap](./image-1.webp)\\n\\nSo far this year, the most critical event for EPNS was our token generation event (TGE) and Polkastarter IDO in April. A lot of pre-work went into that event, however \u2014 and we spent the first few months of the year laying down some foundations for the EPNS protocol.\\n\\n**Developer Tooling:** We continued to develop our SDKs, [Subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/epnsproject/epnsprod), new back-end infrastructure support, and more tools for the developers to build faster and better integrations with EPNS.\\n\\n**Staging Environment:** Have you checked out our staging environment? If not, you should \u2014 it\u2019s where much of the fun happens. Throughout the past 6 months, we\u2019ve been adding quick access to additional resources to better help people onboard themselves to the EPNS protocol, including: DAI minter, Ropsten Faucets, app download links (Android & iOS), quick access to documentation material, and more.\\n\\n**Channels:** EPNS lets anyone subscribe to channels that deliver them notifications based on customizable actions that occur on-chain, lettering users stay on top of their addresses and dApp activity like liquidation warnings in DeFi. We\u2019ve spent time this year rolling out a lot of\\n\\n**Chrome Extension:** Recently, we announced the arrival of EPNS Chrome Browser Extension Alpha v0.1! The EPNS Chrome Browser extension is now LIVE in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/epns-protocol-alpha/lbdcbpaldalgiieffakjhiccoeebchmg/).\\n\\n# The $PUSH Token Launch\\n\\nIn April, we celebrated one of our largest milestones to date: the $PUSH token generation event. $PUSH is the native token to the EPNS protocol [\u2014 to learn more, see here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-token-economics-d7f566c29b1a).\\n\\nThe TGE began with our IDO on Polkastarter. During the IDO, we raised over 44 ETH from over 400 participants. Later that day after the Polkastarter IDO, $PUSH went live on Uniswap, and permissionless trading began. Just a couple of days later, we announced our listing on WazirX, India\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\\n\\nTo date, $PUSH has $118m in volume on Uniswap with over 3,000 on chain token holders \u2014 also securing a spot in the top 150 token pairs. We\u2019ve also listed on MEXC \u2014 with more exciting announcements to come!\\n\\nTo learn more about the TGE and the token distribution of $PUSH, [see here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/announcing-the-epns-push-token-generation-event-4d1699e716f5).\\n\\n# Ecosystem Collaborations\\n\\nWe see so many opportunities for notifications in the Web3 ecosystem. Especially following our TGE, we started collaborating with leading protocols in the blockchain space to help them scope, create, and test those opportunities for their platforms ahead of our mainnet launch. We\u2019ve announced _over 25 collaborations_ in 2021, including:\\n\\n- [Aave](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-collaborates-with-aave-to-bring-push-notifications-to-aave-users-3cdd7baf38e0)\\n- [Uniswap](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/accelerating-defi-with-epns-f2cbfaa33c91)\\n- [Gitcoin](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/gitcoin-growing-open-source-using-web3-notifs-36a9ec6e97dc)\\n- [Polygon](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/scaling-web3notifs-on-polygons-layer-2-100e19e3269d) (prev.

Our rewards program offers a total of 5,510,000 $PUSH to be distributed during the program, which ends on 15th March 2023.\\n\\nThe incentives website launched with two pools: The PUSH Staking Pool, and the Uniswap LP Pool, allowing users to participate in yield farming and liquidity mining opportunities and enjoy great APYs.\\n\\nLearn more about EPNS Rewards and $PUSH Incentives [here](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-liquidity-rewards-program-d16ff2c0fef4).\\n\\n# Community\\n\\nWhere would we be without our community? Answer: not very far. We spent a lot of the past six months finding as many opportunities as we could to thank you for all the support you\u2019ve shown us. A portion of our TGE airdropped funds to early users of the protocol \u2014 i.e. those who stuck with us through the bugs to help us arrive at the best product for Web3 notifications.\\n\\nAfter our token release, we announced the [Rockstars of EPNS NFT gratitude program](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf). For the next year following the token launch, we are distributing 1 NFT and 2,400 $PUSH to one community member a week who demonstrates their support of the EPNS protocol. So far, we\u2019ve seen memes, videos, documentation recommendations, and more submitted on Twitter and are blown away by the support and creativity of the community.\\n\\nKeep rocking on \ud83e\udd18\\n\\n# Looking Ahead\\n\\nWe\u2019re ecstatic about all we\u2019ve achieved this year, but we know there\u2019s so much more to do to bring about the community\u2019s vision for a notification layer of Web3. One of our biggest communication efforts this year was the [**2021 EPNS Roadmap**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12), which we published in April following the TGE. The Roadmap lays out our plans for Q3 and Q4 of this year, letting the community know what\u2019s in the pipeline.\\n\\nAnd what\u2019s the most exciting part of the roadmap? In our opinion, it\u2019s the impending mainnet launch of the EPNS protocol. After months and months of testnet tinkering, we\u2019re excited to officially bring notifications to the Web3 ecosystem, and work with our collaborators to offer better communication to their users.\\n\\nMainnet is so exciting \u2026but wait!! let\u2019s also talk push nodes which will make L2s communication a reality\u2026 and the fact that they can theoretically support other blockchains (even non-evm ones) is a PoC which we all want to see happening! Onwards to infinity and beyond!\\n\\nMuch \ud83d\udc95, from us to you!\\n\\nThe EPNS Team"}}')}}]);
