Ethereum did the same for applications of all shapes and sizes. DeFi extended these principles, demonstrating a wide array of large-scale use cases for institutions and traders alike.\\n\\nNow, as an industry, we\u2019re on the precipice of our next major tipping point.\\n\\nConsumer crypto.\\n\\nIt has exploded onto the scene over the past year and continues to dominate web3\'s zeitgeist. Conferences, podcasts, thought leaders, investors, and builders are all doubling down on its themes.\\n\\nMajor investors are prioritizing consumer crypto projects, particularly in social protocols, apps, and games, highlighting the industry\'s evolving focus and future direction.\\n\\nToday, consumer crypto resembles the early days of online businesses during the dot-com boom. While many consumer-focused protocols and apps may be short-lived, a select few are poised to stand the test of time.\\n\\nCurrently, we\'re in the nascent stages of this boom.\\n\\nOver the last 5 ETH Global hackathons, 80% of builders building with Push Protocol have chosen to ship projects focused on the consumer crypto niche. This is a major shift from 4 years ago when the same could be said for NFT marketplaces.\\n\\nHowever, when you search \u201cconsumer crypto,\u201d you get a wide variety of answers as to what it is, why it matters, and where it\u2019s going.\\n\\nThere\u2019s never been a better time than now to sift through the viewpoints and fully grok it.\\n\\nIn this post, we aim to:\\n\\n***\u2022 Establish a clear definition of consumer crypto***\\n\\n***\u2022 Explore the key reasons for its importance***\\n\\n***\u2022 Comment on its future trajectory***\\n\\n# Defining consumer crypto\\n\\nIndustry professionals are thoroughly split on exactly how to define consumer crypto. Some suggest it all comes back to NFTs and their related token standards. Others say everything in the industry is moving towards consumer scale and has always been meant to go that route. \\n\\nOthers term it the movement focused on web3 apps that are purpose-built for everyday use by billions of people. While this is closer to the point, it doesn\u2019t quite hit the nail on the head either. \\n\\nConsumer crypto isn\u2019t solely about web3 apps becoming household names. \\n\\nIt also refers to every layer of the stack being hyper-focused on providing novel experiences powered by the blockchain, smart contracts, tokenization, and everything in between. Zooming in, it could then be said that consumer crypto is the niche of the greater crypto industry that\u2019s focused on building the future of all apps and services, powered by blockchain tech. \\n\\nHowever, that\u2019s still not quite it. \\n\\nThere\u2019s something more that needs to be included because to scale all things crypto or more accurately, all things web3, to the masses, we need improvements to every level of the industry\u2019s aggregated UX.\\n\\nHowever, this concept needs to be simplified for the average person to grasp it. To establish a universal definition for consumer crypto, it\'s important to first identify and address what isn\u2019t working.\\n\\nMost consumers object to using crypto or anything related because they don\u2019t see the need to switch to it. They return to the option they already trust and continue interacting within its walls. \\n\\nThis measure of how often users keep coming back to an app is called \u201cstickiness,\u201d and it\u2019s something that web3 apps have yet to achieve on any comparable level to web2\u2019s household names. \\n\\nThink about why Slack is sticky, even for Web3 teams. \\n\\nOnce you pass a certain threshold of all-time messages sent, it becomes the standard for communication in your workplace. It doesn\u2019t matter, in most cases, how many alternatives pop up. Your historical conversations and all the documents you\u2019ve ever shared are stored in your team\u2019s Slack.\\n\\nWhat about Google Meet?\\n\\nIt\u2019s a sticky progressive web app because it seamlessly integrates with your calendar and it just works. You can schedule a meeting in four clicks, counting inputting participating emails, and you don\u2019t even have to have a Gmail to join one you\u2019re invited to. \\n\\nPeople keep coming back because, above all else, it\u2019s intuitive to use and it doesn\u2019t lock anyone out. \\n\\nConsumer crypto, as a whole, is a vision to build out sticky apps that scale far beyond the web3 niche. All in all, the key goal is for them to be just as intuitive to use as their legacy counterparts and more attractive due to the new, on-chain-enabled features they champion.\\n\\nTo narrow down what this means, let\'s consider the rise of DeFi. \\n\\nSince 2020, the success of protocols like Aave, Uniswap, and Maker has demonstrated, in practice, the power of transacting with minimal fees, globally, and without intermediaries. Truthfully, the term DeFi, stretches far beyond these protocols and their counterparts to all of crypto that deals in financial use cases. Even Bitcoin, for example, may be considered \u201cDeFi,\u201d when it is used to store value, or simply, to do business. \\n\\nAs institutions like Blackrock continue to buy in, that\u2019s only becoming clearer by the day. \\n\\nWhile both DeFi and consumer crypto are niches within the same industry, they have considerably different target markets. DeFi aims to provide the future financial system, piece by piece, to institutions, traders, and individuals. \\n\\nConsumer Crypto is the vision of developing intuitive, sticky, and user-governed applications that leverage blockchain technology to deliver seamless, chain-abstracted experiences. These applications extend beyond financial services, enabling any user to engage with a diverse range of web3 applications for various purposes, fostering widespread adoption, and enhancing everyday digital interactions.\\n\\nBelow, we dig into why that needs to be done, and how we, as builders, can do it. \\n\\n# Why does consumer crypto matter?\\n\\nThe top hurdle for web3, as a whole, continues to be how inaccessible it is to the average person. To change that, we need to commit to radically improving how we onboard new users to our apps, how we seek to retain them, and what use cases we\u2019re building for as well as supporting, through grants programs, hackathons, and otherwise. \\n\\nOnce we achieve this, it will become clear why consumer crypto is essential and why it represents the next paradigm shift for all consumer apps.\\n\\n**Seamless Onboarding**\\n\\nFrom approval signatures to bridging, to holding multiple tokens just for gas fees on different networks, to managing multiple wallets, [and beyond](https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/), web3 apps are rife with complexity. Changing the status quo requires unifying the user experience regardless of all these intricacies. \\n\\nA commitment to learning from web2\u2019s successes and failures is a good start. \\n\\nChain abstraction across the board, [as we describe in a past post here](https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/), takes us further. \\n\\nSpinning up an account on a web3 app must be as easy if not easier than doing so on something like Facebook.  Simplicity needs to reign across the board in our approach to UX and we need to commit to benchmarking to leading legacy apps that are household names to ensure this happens. Moreover, putting all of the innovations that make this industry great on the back end does not mean hiding them. \\n\\nUntil all of this is achieved, onboarding will continue to be a major barrier to widespread adoption and the advent of an age in which on-chain apps supplant off-chain apps. \\n\\n**Long-Term Retention**\\n\\nRaising retention is a multi-sided problem. To retain users over the long-term, we must ensure better and seamless UX.\\n\\nWith web2\u2019s common approaches to it and the unique features that web3 has in mind, it becomes easier to solve. \\n\\nThink about the apps you have on your phone. What reminds you to check them? Push notifications. There\u2019s a reason we still need them, even in this space. When done right, they\u2019re one of the most effective methods that apps employ to retain users. \\n\\nWhen your phone\u2019s locked and you receive a push notification saying that you got a new message from a friend on an app, you check that app. It\u2019s a reflex, in most cases. The same principle applies to web3. If you\u2019re a trader and you get a push notification in your wallet that says the asset you\u2019re tracking has reached the price you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019ll head to your account and trade that asset. Delegates for a DAO who receive the same sort of notification that a vote has begun will head to Snapshot or wherever that vote is being held to participate. The same goes for fans of a particular NFT artist who receive a ping that a new drop is live or fans of a podcaster who see that a new episode is live. \\n\\nPush notifications are still key to keeping people engaged, even on-chain. \\n\\nBeyond push notifications, numerous other methods for enhancing user retention exist, both predating web3 and emerging from it. The initial rise of NFTs has already shown the power of royalties, guaranteed in perpetuity, by smart contracts. Most legacy marketplaces and social media platforms offer only negligible profit-sharing, if any. \\n\\nIt\u2019s the call for change we\u2019ve seen since the earliest days of social media. Give us apps that prioritize the users, including creators, first, above all else. \\n\\nAdd in DAOs as well as the lego-like composability that smart contract-based applications have and you\u2019re starting to get the picture as to how consumer crypto can do that. At present, both creators and general users lack meaningful upside in the apps they use daily. Any significant gains\u2014monetary or otherwise\u2014are subject to the whims of centralized entities. \\n\\nUser-led apps flip the status quo on its head, for the better. \\n\\nIf something isn\u2019t working, it can be changed via a vote. Apps evolve based directly on what their communities want to see and any advertising that is done is opt-in. \\n\\nAny revenue that\u2019s generated goes both to the app itself, to keep the lights on and keep it scaling, and to its community, with the latter receiving the lion\u2019s share. \\n\\nToken-based incentives such as higher statuses and higher rewards based on longevity and participation further increase retention even further.  \\n\\n**Diversification of Use Cases** \\n\\nHowever, none of the above matters if we, as an industry, can\'t demonstrate a stronger commitment to a broader range of use cases for our apps. Currently, the majority of existing web3 apps are DeFi-focused.\\n\\nConsumer crypto aims to change that by providing intuitive, fun, sticky apps that rival those that are today\u2019s leaders in the social media, gaming, and marketplace niches. Chain abstraction, [cross-chain requests](https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/), and [related solutions](https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/) are making it easier than ever for that to happen.  \\n\\nAs previously mentioned, through recent hackathons, we\u2019re already able to see consumer apps leading the charge.\\n\\nConsumer crypto matters because it\u2019s the movement through which web3 expands its boundaries to the next billion users. \\n\\nIt\u2019s the only way that we finally cross the chasm to being the standard-bearers for all online interaction instead of a tech-heavy alternative. \\n\\nOnce everyone in our industry shows commitment to that in practice, consumer crypto will become the dominant driving force for the industry\u2019s move to expand crypto beyond finance and achieve widespread adoption. \\n\\n# What\u2019s the future of consumer crypto?\\n\\nSince Bitcoin\'s inception, we\'ve advocated for a financial system and a world that levels the playing field more than ever before. Our apps need to strike a balance\u2014easy to use, yet demonstrating these principles in action. We need more engaging, participatory, on-chain economies, of all shapes and sizes, embedded within enjoyable user interfaces. \\n\\nThis doesn\u2019t require reinventing the wheel. Our next break-out moment may come from a team saying, *\u201cHow can we make a better Instagram with features and functionalities unique to this industry?\u201d*\\n\\nThat app would likely also be DAOified because you can\u2019t have consumer crypto without governance by the people, for the people. Decentralized Governance, as an overarching model for our future social apps, aligns perfectly with the broader vision of consumer crypto, as it ensures apps evolve in a more participatory fashion than ever before. Web3-app users can have a direct say in how the app they\u2019re using evolves as well as how it approaches key questions like compensation for creators, which is technically not possible in traditional web3 apps, where all control lies in the hands of the few. \\n\\nConsumer crypto is the next **Schelling** point for our industry. \\n\\nIt\'s the driving force propelling us toward a future where web3 becomes the standard for all global consumers\' online interactions. To travel further down that road, let\u2019s start by building things on-chain that people beyond our sphere, legitimately want to use. Let\u2019s also commit to making crypto easier to use than ever. \\n\\nWith that, we might reach an age in which a web3 app is just an app and a protocol is just a structure behind it. \\n\\nAn age of seamless interaction, on-chain,  where users no longer have to bother about the underlying chain behind their favorite applications.\\n\\nHere at Push, we\u2019re all aligned and focused on this vision. \\n\\nIf you\'re building in consumer crypto, then we\'re here to support you every step of the way.
