As a result of this collaboration, investors on RealT\u2019s platform will soon receive updates about upcoming sales, token delivery, and rent delivery. Additional use cases will be implemented along the way.\\n\\nAmong the many applications of the emergent blockchain technology, tokenization of real-world assets is the one that draws attention from the global markets. Indeed, tokens on the blockchain allow to store value and information in a secure and verifiable manner. Now, by leveraging this technology and attaching a real-world asset to it, it becomes easy to prove the value, ownership, and rarity of the asset.\\n\\nThis is especially useful in the real estate industry where there\u2019s limited transparency, the use cases for fraud, forgery, and duplicity of documents. By tokenizing real-estate on the blockchain, not only are these fraudulent practices eliminated but it also opens doors for anyone to invest in property globally. With this very aim launched RealT, the firm tokenizing a company which held the property as an asset.\\n\\n### Tokenized Real Estate\\n\\nAs mentioned before, RealT is a platform issuing security tokens that interact with DEFI projects. It essentially turns the ownership of property into digital tokens that retain all the legal rights and protections that are offered by traditional ownership. It opens up new dimensions in the world of real estate by allowing investors across the globe to tap into the US real estate market.\\n\\nRealT offers a specially curated list of properties to its community of users and they can invest as much or as little as they want. Token holders receive the rent through the blockchain and can sell anytime without any hassle. RealT\u2019s visions have been lauded by the market and the project has seen substantial success so far.\\n\\nWith the development of its ecosystem and different up-coming use cases, RealT wanted to bring decentralized push notification to its users. In this regard, RealT needs a proper communication channel that allows the platform to keep its users updated on different status of the coming sales, tokens and rent delivery. And through this collaboration, we aim to build this communication channel for RealT.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail?\\n\\nAs a result of our pilot collaboration, RealT will have an official channel on the EPNS platform. Users who choose to subscribe to this channel will get directly connected for seamless communication in a decentralized manner. They can receive push notifications about the various happenings on the platform.\\n\\nAs RealT continues to revolutionize the real estate industry, we are pleased to collaborate with them to ensure the smooth running of their processes in an effort to improve the network. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of the RealT network.\\n\\n# **About RealToken (RealT)**\\n\\nRealT is a platform which allows investors around the globe to buy into the real estate market through fully-compliant, fractional, tokenized ownership. RealToken reinvented traditional real estate ownership by providing investors a simple, intelligent, and user-friendly method to buy a property, leveraging the US legal system through an LLC or Inc structure. RealT establishes an LLC or Inc for each property, and tokenizes those interests into security offerings. Currently, RealT\u2019s real estate offerings are based in the US, but has plans in the near-term to expand globally."}}')}}]);
