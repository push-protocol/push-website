Merge of Incentive dApps**\\n\\n**b. Merge of Governance Section**\\n\\n**c. Notifications Search and Filter**\\n\\n**d. The Developers Section**\\n\\n**d. Dynamic User journey**\\n\\n**e. Olvy Integrations for announcements & releases**\\n\\n**f. A specific section for the SPAM Box**\\n\\n**g. The In-Demand & Beautiful DARK Mode theme \ud83c\udf17**\\n\\n**h. Beautified and Enhanced UX design**\\n\\nWhile these are the features that are currently available on the main EPNS dApp, there are a couple of more really interesting ones that are in the works and will be launched eventually.\\n\\n## The Merge of Governance & Incentives dApp\\n\\nWith our new UI, the navigation experience through our multiple other dApp is now a lot more effective.\\n\\nAlso, the EPNS dApp now includes the Governance section and allows a user to seamlessly navigate and _explore the EPNS governance world, check their voting power or initiate the voting delegation process to other community members, etc._\\n\\nSimilarly, users can now interact with the incentives dApp as well, right from the main EPNS dApp without the need to switch between multiple tabs on your browser.\\n\\n## Notification Search & Filter\\n\\nNotifications are important, undoubtedly. However, given the fact that the _Web3 world never sleeps \ud83d\ude00,_ there could be a scenario where your inbox is loaded with different notifications.\\n\\nTherefore, in order to provide additional power to the users and make their lives much easier, the new user interface also comes with a notification search and filter option.\\n\\n![Second image of The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here](./image-2.webp)\\n\\n<ImageText>Notification Search and Filter</ImageText>\\n\\nThis feature enables the user to search for very specific notifications they would like to see.\\n\\nAdditionally, the UI provides the users with different kinds of filters that they can easily apply to their notifications.\\n\\n- **_Notifications based on Channels:_** This allows the users to search for notifications that were sent out by a particular channel.\\n- **_Search by keyword:_** With this filter in place, users can directly search for any notifications based on keywords within a specific notification.\\n- **_Start Date_:** Notifications can be filtered out from any given start date.\\n- **_End Date_:** Notifications can be filtered out from any given end date\\n\\n## Inbox VS Spam Box\\n\\nUnlike the previous user interface, the new one has specific sections for your **inbox** and **spambox** respectively.\\n\\nMost of you might already know, that the notifications from channels that a user is not subscribed to shall land in the Spam Box. This spam box shall now be a different page where all notifications from unsubscribed channels could be seen.\\n\\nHowever, the spam box shall also include an opt-in button for every notification which technically allows the user to opt-in to a channel, even from a spam box, if they find the notifications useful or interesting.\\n\\n![Third image of The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here](./image-3.webp)\\n\\n## Developer Section\\n\\nWhile the creation of a channel is an important step for you to set up your service and start sending notifications, it\'s not a mandatory step. A user who is simply interested in receiving notifications of the web3 world is only required to opt-in to his/her favorite channel and that\u2019s it.\\n\\nTherefore, in order to avoid confusion on this specific part, the new interface shall include a separate section for services and developers to set up their channels.\\n\\nMoreover, the developer section, as of now, shall include 3 important parts:\\n\\n- **_Main Channel Creation page_**: This shall be the main channel creation page where the users will have to deposit the required amount and pay for the gas(_the real ether \ud83d\ude00_). Channel creation on this page shall ensure that your channel is now created in the production environment and is live on the EPNS Core smart contract.\\n- **_Test Channel Creation page_**: However, in order to get a clear understanding of how the channel creation process works, the developer section of the dApp shall also include a test channel page. This shall not be connected to Ethereum mainnet but with the Kovan testnet and hence no real fees shall be involved in the process. Hence, this can be used as a test playground to understand the different steps involved in channel creation. Once the developer is confident enough, they can go ahead and create a real channel on the main page.\\n- **_Developer Docs_**: Documentation can be of great help to get a better understanding of any piece of software. Hence, the developer section, being comparatively more technical than all other sections of the dApp shall also include the developer documentation link.\\n\\n![Fourth image of The All-New EPNS Dapp UI is finally here](./image-4.webp)\\n\\n<ImageText>Developer Section in dApp</ImageText>\\n\\n## Dynamic User Journey\\n\\nNavigating through a decentralized application can be tough, and we certainly understand that.\\n\\nKeeping this in mind, we have included an extensive and dynamic user journey in our new dApp. Starting from basic introductions to receiving notifications on your device, this walk-through feature shall guide you through all of it.\\n\\nAlthough our user interface is minimalist and incredibly simple to navigate, the user can choose to go through this dynamic user journey as much as they to get a better understanding of what each component of the dApp does.\\n\\nThis is also built, considering the fact, that not every user is a web3 expert and we wholeheartedly want to enhance the user experience of new web3 users with our simple and intuitive dApp design.\\n\\n## Olvy Integrations\\n\\nAs an additional feature, we also included the Olvy integrations with both of our dApp, i.e., [prod](https://app.epns.io/) and [staging](http://staging-app.epns.io/).\\n\\nEvery new release, announcement, and important development shall now be beautifully shared via olvy and directly appear on the dApp itself.\\n\\n## The Dark Mode\\n\\nLast but not the least, the **Dapp** now has the incredibly beautiful dark mode as well.\\n\\n_I might be slightly more inclined towards the dark theme, but, who isn\u2019t?_\\n\\n# Wrapping it Up\\n\\nAll in all, I\u2019d like to say, this has been a great start to the new year!\\n\\nI mean given so many developments across the incentives and governance bit, being able to search and filter notifs better and of course the remarkable display and design updates!\\n\\nI think it has given an impetus to how we\u2019ve tried to better the overall experience and of course, we\u2019re looking to soar higher and higher from hereon!\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited about Q2! What about you?"}}')}}]);
