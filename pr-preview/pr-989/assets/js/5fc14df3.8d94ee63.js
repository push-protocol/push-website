We discussed why Argentina became a hub for innovation due to all challenges people face on a daily basis. And we got the Alpha as to what he will be talking about during his talk in ETH Latam (<b><i>don\u2019t miss it!</i></b>), and his \u201ctoy project\u201d that as per Harsh \u201cwill change the world in the future!\u201d.\\n\\nWe couldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to get Mariano\u2019s opinion on one of the most anticipated events in crypto \u2014 the <b>Ethereum Merge.</b> Looking forward for this moment to come!\\n\\nNext in line \u2014 <b>Juan David</b> from the Colombia community \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf4 brought the latino style into the conversation and decided to spanglish things up!
