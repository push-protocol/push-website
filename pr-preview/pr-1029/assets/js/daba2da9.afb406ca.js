Can you provide a brief introduction to the core team behind EPNS?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nAwesome! I mentioned my intro above owing to the excitement but here it is again \ud83d\ude05: I am Harsh, Founder and Project Lead of Ethereum Push Notification Service. Some background about me, I love dabbling in all things tech; and have been fortunate enough to have the support from the awesome Ethereum and blockchain community to have been given the chance to create/change the communication layer for Ethereum and Web3 which we like to call as The Missing Piece of Web3.0\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nVery Impressive\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nI am the co-founder of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS). I wear multiple hats at EPNS though am focused on mostly Marketing, Growth and Product. Stoked to be #BUIDLing World\u2019s First Decentralized Notification Protocol. Looking forward to some awesome questions.\\n\\nEPNS Journey so far: We have had an awesome journey! Ideation and loads of research were taken to Ethereum Foundation -> EthGlobal HackMoney 2020 where we build POC -> selected for IDEO PVD -> selected for Gitcoin Kernel fellowship and came out as top 20 projects! -> entered Gitcoin Grant round 7 (top 5 projects / 210+ contributors) which led us to raise our seed!!!\\n\\nReally happy and grateful to share that we recently completed our seed round and were honored to get backing from notable web3 leaders including Balaji Srinivasan (Fmr CTO of Coinbase, General Partner at a16z. Cofounder of Earn, Counsyl, Teleport), Kenneth Ng (Ethereum Foundation), Scott Moore (Co-founder, Gitcoin), Mariano Conti (Fmr Head of Smart Contracts, MakerDAO), Anthony Sassano (EthHub / TheDailyGwei), DeFiDad (COO, Zapper), Ravindra (Frontier Wallet), Preethi Kasireddy (Fmr Partner at a16z), Auryn Macmillan (Gnosis), TheLAO, MetaCartel VC, BR Capital, 4RC and several more awesome peeps!\\n\\nSo, yeah, we had an amazing time so far and I think it was all due to the community love and support for which we are forever grateful and indebted \ud83d\ude4f!\\n\\nYou can learn more about our team, Advisors and very awesome Investors and backers on our website [epns.io](https://epns.io/)\\n\\nthank you \u263a\ufe0f\\n\\n![First Image of AMA with Decentralized Club \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80](./image-1.webp)\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nAmazing\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\\n\\nYou\u2019re welcome\ud83d\ude09\\n\\nOk, can we go on to next question\ud83d\ude4b?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nDone\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nNext question\ud83d\ude4b\\n\\nQ2. Can you talk a bit about what services does EPNS offers and how customers can subscribe to it ?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) in its core is a decentralized communication protocol that enables any smart contracts, dApps or even traditional services to send notifications to wallet addresses\u2026 as long as those wallet addresses have opted in to receive them from a particular service.\\n\\nThere is also a DeFi aspect to the protocol that is used to enable incentives or passive earnings for the users along with receiving these decentralized notifications.\\n\\nhow customers can subscribe to it ?\\n\\nBeing a communication middleware, users have to visit [https://app.epns.io](https://app.epns.io/) and subscribe (opt in) for notifications from a channel (services that want to send notifs). The next step is receiving those notifs for which users can download our iOS or Android app and they are ready to go! (check out [https://epns.io](https://epns.io/) for relevant links).\\n\\nDropping the teaser cause we worked really hard to make it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwwnlmUpRsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwwnlmUpRsk)\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nAmazing \ud83d\ude0e It shows a lot of transparency\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\n\ud83d\ude4f\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nNext question :\\n\\nQ3. Can you throw some light to how many subscribers are currently utilizing EPNS services and what\u2019s their feedback ?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nWe are currently live on ropsten as an alpha and users can subscribe to their favorite channels and get live notifications! We have over 500 users on the protocol and counting!\\n\\nSome of the awesome channels we currently have (channels are services sending notifs to their subscribers) are Wallet Movement Tracker, ETHGas Tracker, ETH/BTC Price, ENS Domain Expiry and more are coming soon! All of them getting delivered pseudo anonymously to a user wallet address just like how web3 communication should be :).\\n\\nFeedback is awesome, services wanted this on web3 for a long time and users are now able to get notifs which we all have come to love and rely upon when we do anything virtual!\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nCool \ud83d\ude0e\\n\\nLast question of introduction :\\n\\nQ4. What is further planned for EPNS in 2021 ?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nWe have loads of awesome features planned for 2021 and beyond \u26a1\ufe0f. The main ones include TGE, and of course Audit and Mainnet. Loads of incoming features L2 intgeration. A detailed roadmap is in progress and will be shared very soon on our tg channel ([https://t.me/epnsproject](https://t.me/epnsproject))\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nThank you [@harshr](http://twitter.com/harshr) [@RJlwl](http://twitter.com/RJlwl), super insightful and very easy to understand.\\n\\n# \ud83d\udc27 Community ask Questions by Twitter \u2714\ufe0f\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nTwitter question no 1.  \\nUsername : [@Wormz28](http://twitter.com/Wormz28)\\n\\nHow can you say or believe that almost any application in the Web3 ecosystem can benefit from notifications? Can you give some of the highest-impact immediate opportunities in using a DECENTRALIZED PUSH NOTIFICATIONS?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nCommunication from services to the users has been a game changer since notifications were introduced in 2010. If you think about any web2.0 interaction you have in the virtual life, chances are that it began with notifs. For instance: even this TG AMA is getting to many users through notifications! There are many more examples: like the payments you make, your social media interactions, any application you are on and even your facetime calls and messages, they all rely on notifs to get to you!\\n\\nContract this to web3 and you start seeing the importance of communications, the lack of it causes so many pain points including your loans getting liquidated, governance proposals getting missed, ENS domains getting expired, staking rewards getting missed, security audits not reaching the users and many many more!\\n\\nIn essence, a lot of innovative products are being deployed on Blockchain & Web3 especially when it comes to DeFi but they all still face the issue of not being able to communicate with users directly. This tends to be a huge barrier for mainstream adoption, and for customer retention and engagement rates.\\n\\nEven in DeFi alone, we see these to hugely benefit from notifications:\\n\\n\\\\- Near Liquidation Alert (Borrowers & Liquidators),  \\n\\\\- Staking Rewards Available to Claim (Stakers),  \\n\\\\- Staking Rewards About to Expire (Stakers),  \\n\\\\- Price Alerts (Traders),  \\n\\\\- Stablecoin Peg Slippage (Arbitragers),  \\n\\\\- Low Gas Cost (Devs, ETH Power Users),  \\n\\\\- Rebalances (Token Set Users),  \\n\\\\- Index Selection/Weighting Changes (Index Users),  \\n\\\\- Token/Contract Migrations (Protocol Users),  \\n\\\\- Governance Updates, Token Launches,  \\n\\\\- New Collateral Types on Money Markets,  \\n\\\\- New Liquidity Mining Incentives,  \\n\\\\- Yield Farming APY alerts,  \\n\\\\- Escrow Periods Ending / Tokens Coming Unlocked\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nTwitter question no 2.  \\nUsername : [@RahulJayaraj9](http://twitter.com/RahulJayaraj9)\\n\\nInnovation, development, value, from those three things which part do you prioritize the most? And can you explain the reason?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nThis is tricky for a startup to answer! It really depends on phases imo. At the start, innovation is definitely needed otherwise you aren\u2019t really solving a problem. Though right after, you have to do development but in the start you have 1000 things to develop and of course that means picking those development tasks that can drive higher value. This is not to say that the other dev tasks won\u2019t be done but as I said, all of three of these play a huge part though at different phases of a start up cycle. I think currently we are at the value phase.\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nTwitter question no 3.  \\nUsername : [@ShaneNane707](http://twitter.com/ShaneNane707)\\n\\nLiquidity, transaction fees and delays are always important factors in financial services. How does EPNS solve the above problems to attract users?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nAwesome question and one of the reason for EPNS to exist. For transaction fees, we already are working on L2 and that should take care of scalability and fees unless a mainnet contract wants to send notif (in which case, having 0.1% higher fees for including alerts shouldn\u2019t be an issue). For Liquidity, I am not sure whether it\u2019s related to us as we are a communication middleware with DeFi aspect and not a DeFi protocol :).\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nDone!\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nAnd to add -: EPNS forms a critical piece of web3 infrastructure. Imagine new liquidity pools being created on Uniswap or ethereum gas fees coming down or any new / emergency Governance proposal coming up (remb YAM!!). EPNS can ensure communicating such time critical and financial impact updates and news to the users.\\n\\nDONE\\n\\n# \ud83c\udf0d Community ask question by Website \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nWebsite question no 1.  \\nFrom : Sunidhi Jena\\n\\nHow can a user control what notifications he needs in EPNS ?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nYes! we understand the problem users face when it comes to unsolicited and spam notifications \ud83d\ude05. We actually thought a ton about it and there are a couple of ways by which we mitigate the issue (everything happens on protocol \ud83d\ude0a):\\n\\n1. Users have to opt in to receive notifications from the service first before they can start communicating. This ensures that users are always in control, if they unsubscribe, there is no way for a service to add to them.\\n\\n2. To ensure that a service doesn\u2019t turn malicious later on, we attach a Spam Score to them as well which is adjusted by both positive (higher number of subscribers, the passage of time, etc) and negative (unusual number of notifications, a higher number of unsubscribes, etc) actions. This score when it crosses a certain threshold activates the protocol throttle mechanism which is a way to penalize services a bit at first and if they don\u2019t stop then making the throttling go high thereby ensuring that it\u2019s always in the best interest of services to not spam their users.\\n\\nWe are also planning verified badges in the future to ensure that while everyone can create a channel and everyone can opt-in, there is a distinction between spammy channels and verified ones.\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nWebsite question no 2.  \\nFrom : Samuel lux\\n\\nIs there a certain credibility system assigned to a subscription service using which we can understand if it\u2019s spam or legit ?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\nhehe, I think Richa covered this in the first questions itself :D. In short, we attach a spam score as described above to throttle notifications from the protocol itself in case a service starts spamming the users. The last option being removing the service through our on-chain governance. This combined with user always in control ensures that it\u2019s in the best interst of the service to stay complaint!\\\\\\\\\\n\\n| DK | \ud83c\udf3f | Never PM/DM First \ud83d\udc1e Decentralized Club:  \\nWebsite question no 3.  \\nFrom : Annayna Bhakta\\n\\nHow did you came up this project idea ?\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\nThe genesis of the idea was when we sat down to observe what, if any pain points still exist in the way blockchain apps (dApps / smart contracts / services) that we can solve. We were quick to realize that something felt a bit odd and narrowed it down soon to how Web3 tech behaved a lot like the early days of the internet.\\n\\nThink 2004ish when GMail was launched and changed inboxes forever. At that point of time, the internet was still growing and services offered there behaved exactly the same way it does so in Web3 right now. For instance, you as a user were expected to login to the mailbox to check the email, reply to friends / work and then come back to it sometime and rinse and repeat. If you were the trendy one back in those days then maybe you went to myspace and orkut as well! But no matter the service, you were always going back to check on your actions.\\n\\nThis drastically changed with notifications in 2010. All of a sudden, services began to reach out to users whenever an action was required from their end, it increased engagement rate to 7x and massively improved user experience. Notifications have been so engraved into our lives now that we hardly realize most of our online actions are caused by them, think about it, whatsapp, facetime, emails, payments, games all inform you now. You don\u2019t go back to them to check it out.\\n\\nContrast this experience with any dApps, smart contracts or services you interact with on web3. There\u2019s no way to inform users(wallet addresses) any time an important event occurs, instead, the user is assumed to go back to the service time and time again to check their activity. For instance, Liquidation on AAVE, Compound or any DeFi, DAO Governance proposal (Yam!), or ENS / dEx orders. Each of these are a reality right now but no solution exists to address them and the problem will only worsen as more services come to Web3.\\n\\nThis was the moment that we realized that this stone age era of communication in blockchain needs to go\u2026you are not foreclosed by your bank without proper notices that reach you, but DeFi while enabling awesome use cases does that to you ohh so often and we wanted to fix that. With this new found observable knowledge, and the destiny which led us here from being a mobile app entrepreneur in 2010 and seeing the transformation notifications had, we kind of understood that this is what we are meant to create and thus Ethereum Push Notifications Service (EPNS) was born.\\n\\n# \u270d\ufe0f Telegram live Questions answered by EPNS \u2714\\n\\nKop:  \\n\ud83d\udea9Q.Many projects rug pulled and exit scam recently. Why should investors trust your project not to do the same?\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 That\u2019s a great question! I would suggest all investors to really not trust anyone and instead to their own research! Crypto being the wild west, it is essential for anyone to dig around before investing! The same applies for our project as well :). Having said that, in addition to doing your own research, some of the ways by which we can be vetted are:\\n\\n\\\\- By looking at our investors list which includes some notable web3 leaders and then ensuring that these investors have indeed spoken about us  \\n\\\\- By looking at our vesting schedules and vesting contracts which will be available soon to ensure that we can\u2019t rug pull even if we want to  \\n\\\\- By asking questions and looking at whitepaper to make sure that it makes technical sense  \\n\\\\- And lastly, by trying the app / protocol out to ensure that the tech is real and not hog wash\\n\\nThough I would again re-iterate that these are some of the ways that we can suggest, in the end, you as a user needs to come up with many many more before you can be sure so always always ensure that you are doing your own research!\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 [@Randy0061](http://twitter.com/Randy0061)  \\nQ: EPNS uses a loan to AAVE to generate interest that is distributed among the subscribers of the service. Percentage-wise, how high is this interest? Are there other incentive protocols that you will employ to entice more users to use EPNS PUSH notifications?\\n\\nWhile designing the EPNS decentralized notification protocol we wanted to design a WIN-WIN scenario for both the Users (receivers of the notifications) as well as Services (senders of the notification). Our protocol requires a service to activate themselves before they can send notifications, this is a one time step and the activation requires deposit a one-time stake fee.  \\nThis stake fee is then automatically lend out to AAVE protocol and starts generating interest. This generated interest is then distributed to the subscribers of the channel (service) in a weighted fashion thus making the notifications incentivized for the users \ud83d\ude42  \\nIn future, we may employ other protocols as well.\\n\\nHarsh | EPNS:  \\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 It\u2019s going to be $PUSH which is governance and reward share token. We are heavy believers of game theory and believe in win-win for everyone in the ecosystem and the token is designed to enable that as well!\\n\\n$PUSH will enable users to govern the protocol, handle game theory between all our participants, and\u2026 \ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41have reward/pool sharing built into it so every player wins!!\\n\\nWe will also have liquidity/usage mining that will reward participants among several other use cases.\\n\\nThey are incoming and not yet out\u2026 we will have an announcement on it pretty soon \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nRicha | EPNS \ud83d\udce8 | won\u2019t DM first:  \\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 [@Naia999](http://twitter.com/Naia999)  \\nWhat is business model of your project? How it works? and  \\nWho are your potential customers and which markets are you targeting on?\\n\\nWe are big fans of game theory and ensuring win-win for all actors involved in the ecosystem. This ideology along with building the world\u2019s first decentralized notification protocol meant that we can get creative with our business model which is what we went ahead and did, that is created a business model that supports and rewards all 4 participants of our ecosystem:\\n\\nServices that send notifications: They are rewarded in our governance token $PUSH which is rewarded based on the verified number of user wallets that have subscribed to receive their notifications. This ensure that we not only attract official services (AAVE, Compound, ENS, etc) but also third party developers who have the ability to create useful notifications for the Web3 ecosystem as they are also incentivized to do so\\n\\nUsers who receive notifications: We wanted this to be a user centric protocol at it\u2019s very heart, this means that the protocol values users a lot, this means that the user have a lot of win win scenarios including receiving notifications from the services, getting passive income from receiving notifications, rewarding them in tokens for active ecosystem participation, rewarding them for participating in governance and then some more.\\n\\nInfrastructure / User wallets showing notifications: Our end vision is to have user wallets and any end point that serves as an entry point for Web 3 to start supporting notifications and EPNS protocol. For that, our governance system will ensure a perpetual split in the fees for these as long as they can get the governance proposal passed via on-chain governance. The fees segment is collected and distributed via the protocol and will be borne by the services in future as micro fee per notification, monthly or yearly subscription.\\n\\nGovernance Token Holders: The token holders essentially control the core features of the protocol and decide the way forward, for which the protocol rewards them the most by ensuring that they are rewarded for their efforts and are incentivized to balance the protocol. The rewards to token holders are dis in $PUSH tokens which is converted a part of the fees and thus can be really creative in our business model which is what we did exactly.\\n\\nThe DeFi characteristic of the EPNS protocol incentivizes users to earn rewards. The protocol has $PUSH , a non-refundable functional utility token designed to reward users for continuous involvement and engagement in the adoption of the protocol and to achieve the vision of becoming web3 notification standard. $PUSH will be used as a medium of exchange to interact on the protocol. The token is necessary to vote on the features of the protocol. The protocol fees are charged in $ETH or $DAI within the EPNS protocol, but the $PUSH token holders may vote to change these fee parameters.\\n\\nAs we are a decentralized protocol, the markets are global and decentralized as well \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n# Edited by : \ud83c\udf3fDK\u270d\ufe0f\\n\\nYou can stay update to date and learn about EPNS through the following channels, please join us at.\\n\\n**EPNS Telegram** [https://t.me/epnsproject](https://t.me/epnsproject)\\n\\n**EPNS Twitter** [https://twitter.com/epnsproject](https://twitter.com/epnsproject)"}}')}}]);
