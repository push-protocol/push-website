This technology made it possible for a network of participants from different parts of the world to collaborate and run the blockchain network on their terms. All without the need for centralized authorities.\\n\\nHowever, the degree of decentralization of blockchain-based protocols is determined not just by their architecture but also by the way in which they are governed and operated. In this regard, DXdao is DeFi\u2019s super scalable collective that personifies decentralization. With an innovative suite of products, this protocol aims to provide decentralized governance solutions for DeFi protocols to help scale the DeFi industry as a whole. On this ambitious journey, we at EPNS are pleased to collaborate with DXdao to enable push notifications for Swapr Campaign updates and uphold the spirit of decentralization.\\n\\n### How DXdao Can Benefit From Push Notifications\\n\\nAs its name suggests, DXdao is a decentralized autonomous organization that is owned and operated by its community of users. It builds solutions for the development, growth, and governance of DeFi products, with a special emphasis on governance. It has an illustrious list of products that provide services ranging from automated market making and predictions to token launching and programmable incentives.\\n\\nDeFi protocols can integrate these products into their own platforms to create super scalable platforms. And, through one of its star products Swapr, DXdao provides a multi-chain AMM with a suite of unique features including LP governance, DIY farming, and much more. However, without the help of a reliable communication channel, it is difficult to keep users up to date with all events and news to maximize their participation in Swapr. This is where DXdao\u2019s integration of EPNS could be game-changing.\\n\\n### What Does the Collaboration Entail\\n\\nThrough our collaboration with DXdao, we aim to build a robust communication channel through which the network can keep its participants updated about all Swapr campaign events. Users can subscribe to the official channel on EPNS to receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- A campaign in Swapr is expired\\n- A new campaign is starting\\n\\nAs DXdao continues to revolutionize and fully decentralize the DeFi ecosystem, we are pleased to collaborate with them to ensure the greatest user experience for all participants. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of DXdao.\\n\\n### About DXdao\\n\\nDXdao is a decentralized collective that builds and governs DeFi products. DXdao was spawned in May 2019 through a collaboration between Gnosis and DAOstack. Reputation (REP) is voting power in DXdao, and DXD is the financial token with a claim on profit from DXdao products. Some of DXdao\u2019s products include [Omen](https://omen.eth.limo/) (permissionless prediction markets), [Swapr](https://swapr.eth.limo/) (governance-enabled AMM), [Carrot](https://carrot.eth.limo/) (programmable incentives), [Mesa](https://mesa.eth.limo/) (batch auction DEX), DXvote (DAO governance). DXdao believes in governance and decentralization.\\n\\nConnect with us: [Discord](http://discord.gg/4QXEJQkvHH), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dxdao_), [Telegram](https://t.me/dxDAO), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/dx_dao), [DAOtalk Forum](https://daotalk.org/c/daos/dx-dao/15)"}}')}}]);
