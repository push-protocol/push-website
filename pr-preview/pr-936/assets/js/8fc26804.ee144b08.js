Adding incentives and penalties will greatly improve quality participation.\\n\\n# Development \ud83d\udea7\\n\\nThis month many development initiatives that we have been working on are coming together and started the release process.\\n\\n## Smart Contract Audit in progress \ud83d\udc6e\ud83c\udffc\\n\\nA big part of this month\u2019s effort was towards finishing the Protocol segmentation and its corresponding test cases. The formal Audit Process with ChainSafe was initiated by mid-September, and we expect to finish this process within the next couple of weeks.\\n\\n## Showrunners Framework Plug & Play\ud83e\udd16\\n\\nUpon passing a very intense period of testing in our development and staging environments, the Showrunners Framework Plug & Play is almost out! This framework allows services to trigger notifications using off-chain and on-chain logic.\\n\\nTogether with this framework release, we are also providing a step by step **video tutorial** to explain how to easily create your channels. Additionally, we are making things simpler by creating a Github template, and a step by step written guide.\\n\\n## Showrunners channels \ud83d\udcfa\\n\\nHow could we battle-test our revamped Showrunners Framework? You are right! We developed and continue developing more new channels for our awesome Pilot Collabs with the most important protocols in the space.\\n\\n**Channels in the release pipeline:** Oasis.App, bZx, B.Protocol, TracerDAO.\\n\\n**Channels in Development:** PoolTogether, CVI (Crypto Volatility Index), Armor.fi, IDLE Finance.\\n\\nAs usual, with every channel, we learn something new that helps us improve our protocol and our tooling for developers. This month a lot of the lessons learned were applied to the development of the Showrunners framework itself.\\n\\n## Channel Discovery features \ud83d\udd2e\\n\\n![Second Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-2.webp)\\n\\nThis feature required coordinating and developing different components to communicate effectively. Backend APIs, Mobile application builds, updates to the Chrome Browser Extension. The good news is it\'s now complete and ready for release!\\n\\nA new version of the mobile app will be released over the next couple of weeks. For now, here is a sneak peek in case you missed it before!\\n\\n## FrontEnd-SDK \ud83c\udfa8\\n\\nSimilarly to the Showrunners Framework, this release will happen soon and will also include code snippets and samples for developers to easily fetch, parse and show notifications on-screen on your dApps and Mobile Apps.\\n\\nWe are additionally including a WYSIWYG tool to preview how notifications will look like before you send them.\\n\\nGithub repo and documentation coming soon!\\n\\n## Sending Payloads directly to the PUSH Nodes \ud83d\udc7e\\n\\nThis was an Alpha leak \ud83d\ude1c by Harsh at [Messari Mainnet 2021](https://youtu.be/xDhyQQLishU?t=1363)!\\n\\nIn our mission to become the de-facto middleware communication layer for the web2 and the web3, we are opening for services the possibility to interface directly with the PUSH Nodes by dropping payloads directly to them. At this initial stage PUSH nodes will verify that the transaction is coming signed by either the channel owner or one of the delegated wallets for the channel.\\n\\nWhile this is a work in progress and will require more testing and fine-tuning, the demo presented at the Messari Mainnet Conference is a fully working demo that we are hardening and extending as we see fit.\\n\\n## Polygon connect \ud83d\udd37\\n\\nAnother Alpha leak dropped during Messari Mainnet. Following the mission mentioned above, our team set to the task of making sure that the EPNS protocol can work and communicate effectively across chains. With this in mind, we deployed the EPNS communicator contract in Polygon, and have been running rounds of testing to ensure that notifications are being triggered and delivered correctly.\\n\\nDeploying the contracts is just a part of this task \u2014 ensuring that all other EPNS products are compatible is also a big part of it; and while PUSH Nodes play a very critical role in this equation, our team is making sure that Mobile App, Browser Extension, SDKs, and APIs are rock solid with this approach.\\n\\n# More frens, more fun! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\\n\\nWe keep growing our list of awesome Frens, and we couldn\u2019t be more grateful and excited about this.\\n\\n[**CVI (Crypto Volatility Index)**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1433439003215220738?s=20): to implement notifications for users about unexpected changes in index value, updates about upcoming market events, updates about user\u2019s margin positions approaching liquidation, and even arbitrage opportunities specific to the CVI arbitrageurs group.\\n\\n[**Kyber Network**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1440357337093398545?s=20): with this collaboration Kyber looks to notify users about the launch of new liquidity mining programs, pools, and integrations; as well as stream price feeds, alerts about new Kyber Improvement Proposals and more.\\n\\n[**Open Leverage**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1441084477384495108?s=20): this collaboration looks to provide notifications to users when prices move beyond a certain threshold, and also when your position is about to be liquidated or is approaching liquidation.\\n\\n[**Armor.fi**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1442489466799550475?s=20): aims at implementing notifications for their users when any of the protocols they have arCore smart cover for has been hacked, or any of the protocols they have an arNFT for has been hacked as well. Additionally, when user\u2019s arNFT are about to expire, or if their Smart Cover is below or above x% of the actual wallet value and should be updated.\\n\\n[**EasyFi**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1443214048808472576?s=20): with EasyFi, we are looking to implement Web3 notifications to alert about upcoming loan liquidations, changes in interest rates, collateralization ratios and liquidation alerts, Governance-related notifications, and more.\\n\\n# EPNS in the news \ud83d\udcfa\\n\\nWe are ecstatic with all the happenings on this front this month \ud83d\ude07.
