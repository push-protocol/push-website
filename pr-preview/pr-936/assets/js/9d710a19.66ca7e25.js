As a result of this partnership, users of Decentraland will soon receive updates about their transactions through decentralized push notifications.\\n\\nIn the recent past, the metaverse went from being a sci-fi dream to a striking reality that is now unfolding rapidly. The development of blockchain technology and the possibility of a virtual economy powered by digital assets, acted as catalysts to this development, allowing developers to create virtual worlds and experiences, seemingly overnight. In this race toward the metaverse, Decentraland was the earliest and most popular project to bring fully immersive virtual experiences to its users.\\n\\n# Redefining Communication Within Virtual Worlds\\n\\nPowered by the Ethereum network, Decentraland is a community-owned, fully-immersive virtual world that users can experience and interact with. The platform is community-owned as it is fully decentralized and governed by its community of users through the Decentraland DAO. Users become a part of this virtual world as a digital avatar and are free to explore it and experience what it has to offer. Users also have the opportunity to own virtual real-estate in Decentraland and build and monetize their own environments upon it.\\n\\nDecentraland\u2019s virtual economy is powered by MANA, a ERC-20 token that serves as the currency within the virtual world. LAND and Estate hold the ERC-721 standard, representing parcels and merged parcels of digital land. Holders of the LAND essentially own a small part of the metaverse and are free to create experiences and applications in the Decentraland world. Other users can interact with these experiences, win and trade collectibles with fellow users, and even learn at the Decentraland University.\\n\\nGiven the sheer number of experiences and possibilities within this virtual world, it is only fitting for Decentraland to have a communication layer of its own through which it can keep its users apprised of the status of their Marketplace transactions. Through our pilot collaboration with the platform, we\u2019re keen on building this layer.\\n\\n_\u201cDecentraland is revolutionizing user interactions over the internet,\u201d_ says Harsh Rajat, co-founder of EPNS, _\u201cthe network effects of this platform can create massive online communities where users can play, explore, experience, and earn through their interactions with each other. In this regard, EPNS push notifications will serve as a communication layer within the virtual world, allowing users to constantly stay updated and engaged with its happenings. Much like Web2\u2019s social media notifications.\u201d_\\n\\n# What the Collaboration Entails\\n\\nAs a result of this pilot collaboration, Decentraland will have an official channel on the EPNS platform that users can subscribe to. This official channel serves as a communication medium that relays out important information as push notifications to all its subscribers as and when it happens. This reduces user dependence on external media and improves user experience and user engagement rates. Subscribers can expect to receive notifications whenever\\n\\n- When a bid is offered on one of their NFTs\\n- When a bid is accepted\\n- When an order is executed\\n\\nSpeaking of the collaboration, the team at Decentraland said, \u201c_We\u2019re thrilled to form this pilot collaboration with EPNS. Having closely followed their developments and efforts to redefine communication in Web3, we believe EPNS would be a great addition for the Decentraland community, allowing them to be more reactive to what is happening._\u201d\\n\\nAs Decentraland continues to build immersive experiences for Web3, we\u2019re pleased to partner with them on their ambitious journey.\\n\\n# **About Decentraland**\\n\\nDecentraland is the first fully decentralized, Ethereum-based virtual world that is built, governed, and owned by its users. The ever-expanding metaverse is a truly unique ecosystem with its own currency, marketplace, system of property, and decentralized autonomous organization. In this richly detailed world, new creations, such as games, puzzles, artwork, and even whole environments, are added on a daily basis by members of the community. Users are free to explore and discover what Decentraland has to offer as digital avatars and attend live concerts, conferences, exhibitions, dance parties, and many other events that happen every day of the year. In Decentraland the possibilities are simply limitless, and there\u2019s always something to do and new people to meet.
