It is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain\\nbuilt to allow developers to create universal apps and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, and L3s enabling transactions from any chain - any app and any user.\\n\\n[Explore more about Push Chain here](https://push.org/chain/)\\n\\n## Bringing Morph to Push Chain\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc65\xa0What does this mean for Morph and Push Chain Users?\\n\\n**Borderless consumer App experience**\\n\\nMorph users can expand their on-chain usage beyond EVMs into Solana and other nonEVMs without ever leaving Morph\u2019s ecosystem and UX comfort.\\n\\n**Bring web2 normies to consumer crypto**\\n\\nWith Push Chain\u2019s wallet and fee abstraction - everyday internet users (web2 users) can easily experience Morph\u2019s consumer crypto ecosystem with minimal UX overhead - simply by using their social accounts like Google, Apple, Github, X and Discord.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\xa0What does this mean for builders?\\n\\n**Build hyper scalable universal consumer apps**\\n\\nPush Chain empowers developers to build truly universal applications that work seamlessly across all blockchains.\\n\\nPush unlocks hyper-scalability for consumer and mixed consumer apps that have potential of handling millions of daily users with its innovative \'**Consumer Transactions**\' feature, enabling stateless and unordered processing of non-value transfers like social interactions, content sharing, and game actions.\\n\\n[Learn more about Push Chain\u2019s Innovations here](https://push.org/blog/innovations-by-push-chain/).\\n\\n**Read from any chain using shared settlement**\\n\\nPush Chain\'s shared settlement layer provides a powerful foundation for apps on Morph to unlock shaped universal experiences with its ability to read state across any blockchain through its shared settlement layer. This means developers can focus on building engaging user experiences instead of managing complex cross-chain interactions.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd13\xa0Usecase Unlock:\\n\\n**Universal ZK AI agents**\\n\\nPrivacy centric agentic networks like [Zypher](https://zypher.network/) can leverage Push Chain to expand its AI agents reach to any blockchain. Ensuring a Universal, secure and verifiable execution without exposing sensitive data.\\n\\n**Universal Predication Markets**\\n\\nPrediction markets like [Soccersm](https://soccersm.ai/ai-predictions) can not only house users from Morph but also from any other chains to collectively speculate on real-life events. Markets can aggregate liquidity from all chains simultaneously bringing more user traction and better yield opportunities.\\n\\n**Universally Accessible token launchpads** - Like [Muffun](https://muffun.fun/board) on Morph, can utilize the Push Chain and Push Wallet to enable users from any chain (EVM or non EVM) to effortlessly launch tokens on Morph without leaving their existing wallet systems or manually bridge funds.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1.
