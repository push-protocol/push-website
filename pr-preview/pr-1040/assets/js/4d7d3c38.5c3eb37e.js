GM Push Chain!\ud83d\udc4b\\n\\nAfter years of building one of the first consumer apps in web3, one key takeaway we learnt, was the pressing need for a consumer app-centric chain capable of unifying the entire web3 ecosystem under a shared state.\\n\\nThis realization inspired the creation of [Push Chain](https://push.org/chain/) - **a shared-state Layer 1 blockchain that unifies the settlement of all the incredible L1s, L2s, and L3s, enabling any user from any chain to access any app through one unified shared state.**\\n\\n### Governance\\n\\nThe Push Chain proposal received an overwhelming response at the Push Gov Forum with over 92% acceptance.\\nThe proposal then went on to SnapShot for formal voting - and we\u2019re super stoked to announce that the community heavily participated in showing their voice and [passing the massive majority!](https://snapshot.box/#/s:pushdao.eth/proposal/0xa4a301c9a346356326d59e425245459d9fbde71b02aabc49a4ce191f0504f66a) Indicating a positive alignment with the team\u2019s and the community\u2019s vision.\\n\\n### Push Chain WhitePaper\\n\\nIf you\'re curious about Push Chain\'s philosophical and technical foundations and want to take a detailed look, dive into the [Push Chain Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.push.org/).\\n\\nThe Whitepaper constitutes everything you need to know about Push Chain\u2019s Vision, Mission and all the underlying technical innovations that solve the current hardships in Web3.\\n\\n### Push Chain LitePaper\\n\\nWant a quick tour of Push Chain - And learn about the problem it solves, key innovations it brings and the usecases it unlocks - explore the [Push LitePaper](https://push.org/litepaper.pdf)!\\n\\n\x3c!--  --\x3e\\n\\n## 14.
