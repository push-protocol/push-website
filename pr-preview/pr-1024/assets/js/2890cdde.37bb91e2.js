Thus, they are fungible items."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now, consider an art piece by Picasso. Can you replace the original art piece with any other art representing the exact same details and value? Not really.

Let\u2019s look into both."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The fact that NFTs are stored on a blockchain makes them extremely secure. If you own the NFT pegged to a Picasso, you actually have the proof-of-ownership of the painting that is based on a blockchain.
