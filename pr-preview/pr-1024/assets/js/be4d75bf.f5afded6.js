At a finer level, Scroll is a zkEvm Rollup - that executes and publishes transactions to Ethereum in bundles, which then can be proved with minimum compute requirements while preserving transaction privacy using Zero Knowledge technology.\\n\\nScroll is a byte-code equivalent zkevm that closely emulates EVM, enabling almost identical development and user experiences to Ethereum.\\n\\nDeveloping on Scroll is super easy for Ethereum Devs :\\n\\n- Solidity, Vyper, and Huff work out of the box\\n- No re-auditing necessary\\n- Most existing tooling is inherited\\n\\n\\n## What is Push Chain?\\n\\nPush Chain is a shared state blockchain for universal apps, powered by **Chain Abstraction**. It is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain that allows developers to create universal apps and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, and L3s enabling transactions from any chain - any app and any user.\\n\\n**Push Chain\'s Superpowers Include:**\\n\\n- Consumer tx (unordered) and Traditional tx (ordered)\\n\\n- Any Chain Tx (Solana, Eth, EVM, or non-EVM)\\n\\n- Sub-second finality** \xa0\\n\\n- True Scale and Universal Smart Contracts\\n\\n- Wallet and Fee Abstraction\\n\\n[Explore more about Push Chain here](https://push.org)\\n\\n## **\ud83d\udc65\xa0What does this mean for Scroll and Push Chain Users?**\\n\\n**Explore non-evm without leaving Scroll**\\n\\nScroll users can interact with DApps across Solana, Aptos, Bitcoin L2s or any other non evms via Push\u2019s Shared Settlement Layer. All, without manually bridging funds, installing and learning complex wallet systems and ever-leaving Scroll\u2019s Ecosystem Comfort.\\n\\n**Universal  Identity**\\n\\nExploring an open and universal web3 economy requires a universal passport.\\n\\nThis is where Push ID makes a difference- Provides a universal identity system that seamlessly connects all their wallets (EVM and non-EVM) into one profile.\\nEnabling users to track their web3 activity, across Scroll, Ethereum, Solana or any other chain in a unified manner.\\n\\nThe opportunities with Push ID are endless:\\nThink about gated applications - where you\u2019re universal passport gives you access based on your web3 repetition. Or  instances where an app requires you to KYC to prove cross-chain asset ownership.\\n\\nAdditionally, with this partnership - Developers get an opportunity to lean on Scroll\u2019s decentralized prover network and work on fascinating new areas such as post-danksharding blob markets, hardware-friendly ZK algorithms and new ZK primitives. With Push Chain - Devs will be able to take these innovations one notch higher by unlocking the states of other layer 1s and layer 2s, in order to build truly scalable consumer-friendly apps.\\n\\n\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\xa0What does this mean for builders?\\n\\n**Build Apps that enable Txns from Any Chain**\\n\\nPush Chain supports transactions from any wallet, regardless of the originating chain\u2014be it Ethereum, Solana, or any other L1s, L2s or L3s.\\n\\nUse [Push Chain\u2019s Universal SDK](https://push.org/docs) to bring these apps to life - opening doors to craft chain abstracted experiences.\\n\\n**Build hyper-scalable consumer apps**\\n\\nUsing Scroll\u2019s inherent scalability strength and Push Chain\u2019s **Sharded Storage and Parallel txn processing** - Devs can build *hyperscalable consumer apps*  that can be executed with sub-second finality using Push\u2019s  borderless & stateless consumer txns.\\n\\n*This is the era of Consumer DApps thriving with millions of users!*\\n\\nAdditionally, with this partnership - Developers get an opportunity to lean on Scroll\u2019s decentralized prover network and work on fascinating new areas such as post-danksharding blob markets, hardware-friendly ZK algorithms and new ZK primitives.

We are fast moving towards a world where every bit of valuable user-data will be ZK proved. With the Push x Scroll partnership, this important primitive will become truly universal and can be integrated with cross-chain applications as well as liquidity.\\n\\n\\n**Chain Agnostic AI Agents:**\\n\\nPush Chain\u2019s universal shared state and Scroll\u2019s open economy  pave the way for a new generation of chain-agnostic AI agents. These agents can perform autonomous operations in a borderless manner - unlocking a wide variety of financial, mixed financial, and non-financial use cases.\\n\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1.
