Built on the Ethereum layer 2 system StarkWare, dYdX leverages zero-knowledge proofs to provide enhanced security, decentralization, and privacy to its users.\\n\\nAt its core, dYdX is designed for trading perpetuals, which unlike traditional futures or options, do not have expiration dates. This allows traders to speculate on the future value of an underlying asset indefinitely. This unique offering has attracted both institutional and retail traders, making dYdX one of the most popular exchanges in the market.\\n\\nThe collaboration between dYdX and Push is a game-changer in the DeFi industry, empowering traders worldwide with powerful, transparent, and fair financial products. dYdX\u2019s mission to democratize access to financial opportunity aligns perfectly with Push\u2019s commitment to fostering transparency and communication. Together, dYdX and Push are working together to enhance accessibility and pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable financial future.\\n\\nIn this edition of \u201cFrens of Push,\u201d we had the privilege of interviewing Cliffton Lee, Governance and SEA Lead at dYdX. Join us as we delve into the inner workings of dYdX, learn how they\u2019re using Push\u2019s communication layer, and gain insights into the vision and goals that drive this innovative DeFi platform.\\n\\n### 1. Hi Cliffton, what\u2019s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\\n\\nMy name is Cliffton, and I work on all things Governance and Growth for the SEA region at the dYdX Foundation. I first got into crypto in 2017 when I purchased some BTC and ETH on Coinbase as an experiment, and it was only in 2020 that I went deep down the web3 rabbithole and deeply appreciated the importance of decentralized technologies, and how cryptography could enable that. I was drawn into Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, scalability strategies via rollups, and this was how I got involved with dYdX.\\n\\n### 2. Tell us about dYdX \u2014 what\u2019s it about, and what problem does dYdX solve?\\n\\ndYdX is the leading decentralized crypto perpetuals trading exchange. dYdX\u2019s mission is to democratize access to financial opportunity. Few have access to advanced tools and products in the financial system, and dYdX believes in empowering more traders, in more places, with powerful, transparent, and fair financial products.\\n\\nWhile trading on dYdX, traders enjoy the security, privacy and decentralization benefits.\\ndYdX is currently built on top of StarkEx, a layer 2 zero knowledge rollup to Ethereum, and there is works ongoing to build the next version of dYdX v4. dYdX v4 will be fully decentralized end to end, and will be a layer 1 Proof-of-Stake blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK.\\n\\n### 3. How do developers use dYdX?\\n\\nDeveloper documentation: https://dydxprotocol.github.io/v3-teacher/#terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy\\n\\nThese docs describe the v3 API for the dYdX decentralized perpetual contracts exchange. The exchange runs on an L2 (layer-2) blockchain system, and operates independently of previous dYdX protocols and systems, including the v1 and v2 APIs.\\n\\nLike the previous iteration of dYdX perpetuals, the exchange uses a centralized order book, but remains non-custodial, and settles trades and liquidations in a trustless manner.\\n\\n### 4. What\u2019s the 2023 plan for dYdX and its ecosystem?\\n\\nThe main goal is to ship dYdX v4, and to enable the progressive decentralization of the protocol via governance.\\n\\n### 5. How is dYdX using Push\u2019s web3 communication layer?\\n\\ndYdX users currently use Push to get notified of governance updates. Currently, dYdX stakeholders can subscribe to receive notifications when:\\n\\n- A DRC is created\\n- The voting process for DRC begins\\n- A DIP is created\\n- The voting for the DIP is activated\\n- The DIP is queued\\n- The DIP is implemented\\n\\n### 6. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?\\n\\nGreat! Community members have reached out mentioning that Push has been helpful in keeping them notified of what\u2019s happening on the governance front. We\u2019ve seen better engagement rates and higher vote participation.\\n\\n### 7. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?\\n\\nWith dYdX moving to the Cosmos ecosystem, we\u2019re hoping that Push can be compatible with the Cosmos SDK to continue this notification functionality.\\n\\n## About dYdX\\n\\ndYdX is a DEX on Ethereum providing a transparent and secure financial ecosystem for crypto trading.
