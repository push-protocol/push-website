As such, users of 0VIX are poised to receive updates about the various happenings and opportunities, directly from the platform.\\n\\n# Redefining DeFi\u2019s Money Market\\n\\nDeFi\u2019s monumental success over the past few years is no secret now. While there are several contributing factors, it was DeFi\u2019s money market protocols that solidified the success of the industry, culminating into the mammoth of today.\\n\\nHowever, these protocols in the recent past have faced significant challenges, mostly pertaining to risk mitigation. Over-collateralization of assets is the common theme among all the protocols and even after years of decentralization, they maintain an opaque front when it comes to the liquidation of assets. Moreover, the lack of proper cross-chain bridging exposes user assets to operational risks and exploitation.\\n\\nIn this regard, as a DeFi 2.0 money market protocol, 0VIX aims to provide a viable solution to these problems while providing sustainable yields from DeFi to the mass market. The protocol makes use of voted escrow tokenomics and advanced interest rate models to mitigate risks and offer higher APYs to users. 0VIX is based on the Polygon network and aims to build a new money market ecosystem on Polygon. Combine this with a frictionless user experience and we have the recipe for a protocol that future proofs lending, borrowing, and staking of assets in DeFi, to create a money market with universal appeal.\\n\\nNow, as a DeFi protocol poised to receive an influx of new users, 0VIX can benefit from a communication channel that facilitates better communication with its users. This is exactly what we at EPNS aim to achieve with this collaboration.\\n\\n# What Does the Collaboration Entail?\\n\\nThe collaboration between EPNS and 0VIX aims to create a direct communication channel between the users and the protocol for seamless interaction. This channel is housed on the EPNS platform where users of 0VIX can easily subscribe to it. Subscribers will receive decentralized push notifications from the platform whenever\\n\\n- Collateral approaches liquidation\\n- The Collateral has been liquidated\\n- Protocol parameters change\\n- New asset support is added to the platform\\n- Voting for governance begins or ends\\n\\nEPNS has a chrome extension, a dApp, and a mobile application to ensure users never miss out on these notifications. These notifications will build on the existing user experience on the platform and complement it by providing a sense of convenience to users.\\n\\nWe\u2019re pleased to have allied with 0VIX on this project and hope to contribute to the growth of the platform.\\n\\n# **About 0VIX**\\n\\n0VIX is an open-source lending and borrowing protocol enhanced with veTokenomics. Our focus is on providing stable and sustainable yields for Polygon users, through our native token $VIX. We aim to bring billions of dollars of liquidity to Polygon by providing the 3000+ app ecosystem with its first native money market.\\n\\n0VIX is built by the GOGO Protocol team, 35+ professionals, spread across 3 continents, with deep crypto/DeFi expertise and with roots in banking, finance, tech as well as more than 10 years of experience in building multi-billion dollar tech companies such as N26, Consensys, Binance, Deutsche Bank and Sovryn.\\n\\nJoin our community today!
