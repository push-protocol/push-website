Soon, we will be releasing another post with information about the sale date and instructions for how to whitelist prior to the sale.\\n\\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is a protocol for decentralized notifications on the Ethereum blockchain. EPNS enables applications and users to create and subscribe to notification channels, enabling blockchain-native communication between apps and users. The Web3 ecosystem today communicates through channels like email, Medium, Twitter, Discord, WeChat, and more. For rapidly-evolving use cases like DeFi, these forms of communication struggle to scale. EPNS protocol lets applications send push notifications to users regarding updates, account information, product drops, and more. Users can also set up custom notifications in response to on-chain events to better monitor investments, transactions, app security, protocol performance, and more.\\n\\n$PUSH is the native governance token for the EPNS protocol. $PUSH grants its owners voting rights over core functionalities of the protocol, in addition to revenue accrued as network fees. For notifications sent through the protocol, micro-fees are gathered from the service providers. Fees are distributed in a ratio of 70% for $PUSH holders and 30% for the ecosystem development pool. $PUSH governance can vote on fee structures and more.\\n\\nSince the earliest days of EPNS, we\u2019ve been extremely fortunate to have the support and backing of the awesome Web3 community. As a community, you\u2019ve shared invaluable feedback and \ud83d\udc96 to help us grow in this journey.
