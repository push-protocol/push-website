Towards this effort, [GnosisDAO](https://gnosis.io/gnosisdao/) has created a tool that can execute community governance proposals in a decentralized manner, SafeSnap.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to be one of Gnosis\u2019s SafeSnap launch partners. In future, we\u2019re looking forward to using SafeSnap in the EPNS ecosystem to allow greater fluidity in governance.\\n\\nGnosis\u2019s SafeSnap brings on-chain execution to off-chain voting outcomes, via a Gnosis Safe module connected to [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/) (an escalation-game-based oracle). This results in avoiding needless gas costs for on-chain voting, secure assets in Gnosis Safe and a phased approach towards decentralization.\\n\\n## **About Gnosis**\\n\\nGnosis builds new market mechanisms for decentralized finance. Their three interoperable product lines allow you to securely create, trade, and hold digital assets on Ethereum. GnosisDAO is a prediction market-driven collective, stewarding the Gnosis ecosystem through futarchy: governance by prediction markets.\\n\\nStay in touch with Gnosis!
