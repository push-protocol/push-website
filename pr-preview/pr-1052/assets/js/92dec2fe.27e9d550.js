Once a DAO is deployed, Aragon provides a secure and flexible interface that can be used to create and vote on proposals, manage funds, administer tokens with ease, and more. The power of permissionless, trustless technology on the platform makes DAO management and governance a breeze. With a no-code setup, Aragon provides the most user-friendly tech stack to build, launch, and manage your DAO.\\n\\nNow working together, Push is helping enhance the Aragon user experience by providing real-time notifications for critical events within any DAO registered on Aragon.\\n\\n## Push x Aragon: DAO Communication Made Easy\\n\\nPartnering with Push Protocol will further enhance DAO management on Aragon, notifying subscribers any time the status of a proposal changes.\\n\\n<blockquote>\u201cEffective decision-making requires context, but digital workers today often lack the bandwidth to stay on top of what\u2019s happening in every community they participate in. Through this partnership with Push, we are bringing DAO activity closer to where DAO contributors are, making it more accessible for people to participate in the governance of the organizations they love most.\u201d</blockquote> \u2014 <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/_juliettech\\">Juliette Chevalier</a>, Leading devrel at Aragon\\n\\nAragon DAO members will receive notifications for status changes, namely, succeeded, executed, and defeated status.\\n\\nThis will enable DAO participants to stay informed and be more actively involved in governance.\\n\\n<blockquote>\u201cWhile we\u2019re excited to be enhancing the UX of Aragon\u2019s DAO communication, we\u2019re also very excited   about the new standard we\u2019ll be setting for affiliated DAOs created through Aragon and how we\u2019ll be supporting a growing number of DAOs enhance their UX\u201d</blockquote> \u2014 <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/harshrajat\\">Harsh Rajat</a>, Co-founder of Push Protocol\\n\\nThis partnership marks the beginning of our journey together to enhance governance and decision-making for digital organizations of the future.\\n\\nWe look forward to exploring further opportunities to enhance the DAO experience in the Aragon ecosystem\ud83d\ude80\\n\\n<center><b>.   .   .</b></center>\\n\\n## About Aragon\\n\\nAragon builds flexible and secure tools that enable anyone to launch and manage Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). In 2016, Aragon built the first DAO framework, which has since powered the creation of over 5000 DAOs and secured over 12B in value for leading projects like Lido, Decentraland, API3, Aavegotchi and NFTX.\\n\\nAragon recently deployed the new modular Aragon OSx protocol and no-code Aragon App on Ethereum and Polygon. Driven by the mission to enable everyone to experiment with governance at the speed of software, Aragon aims to build a hyperstructure for governance. The Aragon Project is governed by Aragon Network Token (ANT) Holders in the Aragon DAO and built by globally distributed teams.\\n\\nKnow more about Aragon: [Website](https://aragon.org/), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/eqQJkdp), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aragonproject?lang=es), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aragonproject/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCODiU_-FWhr4SVOoBlm-qaQ), [Telegram](https://t.me/AragonProject), [Github](https://github.com/aragon)"}}')}}]);
