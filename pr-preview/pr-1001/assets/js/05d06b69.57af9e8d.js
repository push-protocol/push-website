As expected, all the hackers delivered impressive [work](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1575838134251626496).\\n\\nNow, it\u2019s [ETHBogot\xe1](https://ethglobal.com/events/ethbogota/prizes#push-protocol) time! This Friday, we\u2019re challenging you to surprise and inspire the community with your projects \u2014 at the largest web3 hackathon in LATAM\u2019s history and pushing new boundaries in web3 communication!\\n\\n## Prizes and Ideas \ud83d\udca1\\n\\nWe\u2019ll be awarding multiple prizes totaling $10k for the best and most creative use cases using Push:\\n\\n- \ud83e\udd471st Prize \u2014 $3,500\\n- \ud83e\udd482nd Prize \u2014 $2,500\\n- \ud83e\udd493rd Prize \u2014 $1,500\\n- \u2728Runner up x5 \u2014 $500 each\\n\\nSince Push mainnet went live earlier this year, we\u2019ve seen builders from the web3 ecosystem, such as [ENS](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x983110309620D911731Ac0932219af06091b6744), [dYdX](https://medium.com/push-protocol/app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x23c6b8fB0557FD5e6696BceF3fD4855E0d7018C0), [EarniFi](https://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xeEECa1449a75c96d2B34722AE7eE64121be42111), [Oasis](http://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0x12b3eE60Df8ea26D03b8035Ec90434a38A82C4C7), [Lens Protocol](http://app.push.org/#/channels?channel=0xef6426D522CfE5B7Ae5dB05623aB0Ef78023dBe0), and more, build a variety of creative and useful use cases with Push. For more inspiration, here\u2019re some product requests and sample use cases to get your wheels turning:\\n\\n- \ud83d\udcb0 DeFi: Provide transactional updates with push notifications.\\n- \ud83c\udfe6 DAO: Increase voting turnout using notification alerts.\\n- \ud83c\udfa8 NFT and GameFi: Enable direct communications between players and platforms with simple notifications.\\n- \ud83d\udd27 Tooling: Offer a smooth user journey with push notifications.\\n\\n## Getting Started \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nWe know getting started with building a new project can involve a lot of boilerplate code. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together some simple steps you can follow and create a channel \u2014 as the first step for sending notifications via Push Protocol, and get everything up and running in no time.\\n\\n1. Go to http://staging.push.org and connect your wallet.\\n2. Once Connected, go to the Developer > Create Channel.\\n3. Fill in the Channel Name, Network, and Channel Website URL details.\\n4. Approve the transaction for 50 DAI (note: 50 test DAI and some test ETH are required for channel creation).\\n5. After that\u2019s approved, approve the second transaction call.\\n6. Congratulations \u2014 your channel has been successfully created, and you are all set to send or receive notifications.\\n\\n### Useful links:\\n\\n- [Use case](https://www.notion.so/pushprotocol/Push-Protocol-Use-Cases-c0fe5e17bc634502817bdc60c29221e3)\\n- [Monorepo SDK](https://medium.com/push-protocol/here-comes-the-all-new-epns-sdk-monorepo-framework-8447b486a801)\\n- [Developer docs](https://comms.push.org/docs/ \'Push Developer docs\')\\n\\n### Hackathon survival guide \u2014 if it\u2019s your first hackathon:\\n\\n- Join ETHGlobal [Discord](https://ethglobal.com/discord) to find a team before the hackathon gets started, but it\u2019s totally okay to hack alone.\\n- Go through the [use cases](https://www.notion.so/pushprotocol/Push-Protocol-Use-Cases-c0fe5e17bc634502817bdc60c29221e3) to get some inspo.\\n- Join workshops during the hackathon, i.e., <a href=\\"https://youtu.be/_tJGwyJBclY\\"><i>How to Add Web3 Notifications to Your Project</i></a>.\\n- Clean and easy-to-read documentation to win (and wow) the judges.\\n- Explain what problem you are solving and why your project matters to your users in a short and sweet demo video.\\n- Find the Push crew if you need any help \u2014 from brainstorming to user testing to feedback \u2014 we will be there for you.\\n- One $ tip: the more protocols you are integrating with your hack, the more $ you are more likely to get if you do win.\\n\\n## Let\u2019s Push for Web3 Communication Together \ud83d\udd14\\n\\n<b>A little fun fact:</b> We started building Push (EPNS) in 2020 at the ETHGlobal hackathon, and the feedback we got from the early hackathon community convinced us that it could be so much more. So please remember, you can get pretty far in just a 3-day hackathon, and ETHBogot\xe1 is exactly your opportunity to make something happen!\\n\\nThe Push crew will be around to answer questions and offer our support. If something is missing that you want access to \u2014 find our crew members on site or let us know [online](https://x.com/PushChain).
