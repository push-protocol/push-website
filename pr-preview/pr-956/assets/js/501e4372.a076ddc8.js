Overloading the intrinsic features of NFTs will superpower this very unique asset class and take it to the next level.\\n\\nIn connection with this effort, we are thrilled to announce our partnership with Charged Particles that will help us fine-tune and further develop EPNS protocol.\\n\\nOur pilot program with Charged Particles will consist of:\\n\\n- Working together on implementing decentralized notifications for NFT deposits, interest earned, and other actions in the Charged Particles platform.\\n- Working with the Charged Particles team to enable technical discussion towards building the decentralized communication layer that is scalable and powerful.\\n\\nWhile NFTs are already innovative in nature, protocols like Charged Particles are on a mission to give them an extra \u201cCharge\u201d in an elegant fashion and we\u2019re excited to work with them on this unique collaboration.\\n\\n> _We look forward to EPNS enabling instant notifications for our protocol\u2019s users for nearly all activities happening within their NFTs \u2014 Deposits, Interest thresholds hit, Time-locks expiring \u2014 there\u2019s a lot and we\u2019re truly excited to partner with EPNS to provide these key updates to our users, commented_ Ben Lakoff, Co-Founder of Charged Particles\\n>\\n> Charged Particles is merging the two hottest trends of the industry DeFi and NFT.

The amount of interest earned from the token represents the \u201cCharge\u201d that the token (Particle) has amassed.\\n\\nStay in touch with Charged Particles!
