# Contribute to Push DAO

There are several levels of participation on the Push DAO.
You have the flexibility to contribute as little or as much as you prefer.

Stay informed about DAO activities by following us through our communication channels:

- [Push DAO Twitter](https://twitter.com/Push_DAO) for updates
- [Push Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) community to explore contribution opportunities
- [Push Forum](https://gov.push.org/) to engage in discussions about governance proposals

Push DAO operates in seasons. This allows all our programs and working groups to follow an iterative incremental model, ensuring adaptability and responsiveness to evolving circumstances.

In its progressive decentralization Push DAO has established multiple community-oriented programs, offering clear guidelines on how to embark on your journey as a Push DAO contributor.
