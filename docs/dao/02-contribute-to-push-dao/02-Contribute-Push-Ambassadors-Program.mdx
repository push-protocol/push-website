# Push Ambassadors Program

The Ambassadors program is a unique initiative that allows individuals to represent Push in different ways. Being an ambassador is not just about promoting the brand, but it is also about building relationships with users and potential collaborators. Ambassadors are encouraged to engage with different communities, listen to their feedback, and provide valuable insights to Push. This feedback helps Push to improve its products or services and build a better user experience.
