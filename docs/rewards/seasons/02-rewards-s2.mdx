## Overview

Say hello to [**Push Chain Devnet Drop Points Program**](https://portal.push.org/rewards) S2!

The Devnet Drop kicks off one of many upcoming Gratitude Drops scheduled to give back to our super Push Chain community as we collectively turbo charge our way towards the Push Chain Mainnet 🚀

The Devnet Drop Points Program benefits everyone who continue to be a part of Push’s journey from being the defacto communications protocol for web3 to now being a full-fledged shared state L1 blockchain, uniting every L1,L2 and L3 in the space.

Additionally, the program also benefits:

1️⃣ S2 Program Participants (of course!)
2️⃣ S1 Program Graduates (Push protocol users)
3️⃣ And EVERYONE who’s truly part of Push Chain’s Vision and its journey to Mainnet!

## Earn Rewards for Activities

The Devnet Drop Points Program showcases [Push Chain’s](https://push.org) Early Ecosystem Universal Apps.



The Devnet Appverse includes the following Universal Apps:

1. [Any Chain Mail](https://email.push.org/) - Your wallet address = your email id.
2. [Transaction Simulator](https://simulate.push.org/) - Send superfast txns on Push Chain - from any chain!
3. [Rumors](https://rumors.push.org/)  - Share Secrets, No sign up, no personal data, vote on spicy rumors.

& 4. SURPRISE APP - Revealing SOON!

As mentioned, these Apps are Universal in nature, meaning:

**These apps have the ability to support users from any wallet, belonging to any chain - with ZERO Friction & ZERO Bridging!!**

For instance - With [Anychain Email](https://email.push.org) - a Solana user can instantly send mails to an Ethereum user - instantly, with 0 gas fees!!

Use these apps, perform actions (gasless + no money involved) and earn XP and Multipliers the more you level.

**There are 50 levels per app. The more you use an app, the more levels you climb, the more XP and Multipliers you earn and thus - higher you rank in the Leaderboard.**

Activities are shaped in a way where loyal users who interact with Push will be rewarded and have a fair chance of climbing the leaderboard.
