# Important Concepts

Before diving into the SDK and how you can integrate Push Chain to build the new wave of consumer-centric applications, let's review what Push Chain is.

## What is the Transaction Category?

The transaction category in Push Chain refers to the type of operation the transaction represents, such as email, blog, notifications, or other specific use cases.

It helps identify and organize transactions within the network, allowing precise handling and retrieval tailored to their purpose.

**Note**: Each transaction must have *one* category assigned to it.

## How many recipients can a transaction have?

A transaction can have **at least 1 recipient**, but there is no upper limit to the number of recipients.

Recipients can be wallets on **multiple chains** and do not need to all be on the same chain. For example, a transaction can include recipients on Ethereum, Solana, or other supported blockchains.

## What can the transaction payload contain?

The transaction payload can be **anything**, as long as it is represented in bytes.

The data payload can include any information that suits your application's needs, provided it is associated with a valid **transaction category**. For example:
- An **email** as part of a messaging application.
- A **social media post**, like a text, image, or video.
- A **notification** or event trigger for your application.
- **Game state data** for a gaming app.

## What is `UniversalAccount`?

The **UniversalAccount** is a chain-agnostic way of representing an address, designed to work seamlessly across multiple blockchain ecosystems. It abstracts the details of the underlying blockchain, enabling developers to interact with addresses in a unified manner, regardless of the chain they belong to.

### Example Usage
Here's an example of how to use a UniversalAccount to represent a recipient on the Solana blockchain:

```typescript
const recipients = [
  createUniversalAccount({
    chain: CONSTANTS.CHAIN.SOLANA,
    chainId: CONSTANTS.CHAIN_ID.SOLANA.DEVNET,
    address: 'ySYrGNLLJSK9hvGGpoxg8TzWfRe8ftBtDSMECtx2eJR',
  }),
];
```

## What is `UniversalSigner`?

The **UniversalSigner** is a chain-agnostic way of representing a signer, designed to facilitate signing operations across multiple blockchain ecosystems. It abstracts the underlying blockchain-specific details, providing a unified approach to handle signing logic, regardless of the chain involved.

### Key Features of `UniversalSigner`
1. **Chain-Agnostic Design**: Supports multiple blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Push Chain, or any other chain, enabling a consistent signing experience across chains.
2. **Unified Signing Interface**: Offers a standardized `signMessage` function, making it easy to sign messages in a multi-chain environment.
3. **Extensibility**: Its structure allows for integrating new chains without changing the existing implementation.

### Example Usage
Here's an example of how to define a `UniversalSigner` for the Ethereum blockchain using the `viem` library:

```typescript
const privateKey = generatePrivateKey(); // Replace it with your private key generation logic
const account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);

// Create Signer. Defaults to Ethereum Sepolia
const signer = createUniversalSigner({
  address: account.address,
  signMessage: async (data) =>
    hexToBytes(await account.signMessage({ message: { raw: data } })),
});
```
