# Overview

This page covers the setup of your smart contract environment to interact with Push Chain. Whether you are using Remix, Hardhat, Foundry, or any other tooling, this page will guide you through the process.

## Setting up Local Dev Environment

You can use any EVM tooling including Foundry or Hardhat to deploy your smart contracts.

:::info Recommended Practice

Work on your smart contract exactly the same way you would on Ethereum, then use Push Chain configuration to deploy your smart contracts on Push Chain.

:::

## Deploying with Foundry

Foundry is a blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.

### 1. Install Foundry

To install Foundry, run:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Once the foundryup script is downloaded, follow the on-screen instructions to complete installation. After installation, restart your terminal and run:

```bash
foundryup
```

This will ensure you have the latest version of Foundry tools (forge, cast, anvil, and chisel) installed.

### 2. Create a New Project

Create a new Foundry project:

```bash
forge init myToken
cd myToken
```

Install the OpenZeppelin contracts:

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

This should create a new project with the following structure:

```
myToken/
├── foundry.toml
├── lib/
├── out/
├── script/
├── src/
├── test/
```

### 3. Configure for Push Chain

Now simply modify your `foundry.toml` file to include Push Chain testnet configuration:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
remappings = ["@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/"]

# Push Chain Testnet configuration
[rpc_endpoints]
push_testnet = "https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/"
push_testnet_alt = "https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node2.push.org/"

# This is a placeholder - BlockScout doesn't require an API key but Foundry expects a key field
[etherscan]
push_testnet = { key = "blockscout", url = "https://explorer.testnet.push.org/api", chain = 42101 }

# See more config options https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/config/README.md#all-options
```

This configuration includes:

- Default project structure settings
- RPC endpoints for Push Chain Donut testnet
- BlockScout explorer configuration for contract verification

### 4. Write a Smart Contract

Create a new file at `src/MyToken.sol` with the following ERC20 token implementation:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.22;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

/**
 * @title MyToken
 * @dev A simple ERC20 token for demonstration on PUSH CHAIN
 */
contract MyToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MT") Ownable(msg.sender) {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000 * 10**18);
    }

    function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
        return 18;
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```

### 5. Compile the Contract

Compile your contract with:

```bash
forge build
```

If successful, you should see output similar to:

```
[⠢] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 18 files with 0.8.22
[⠑] Solc 0.8.22 finished in 1.51s
Compiler run successful!
```

### 6. Deploy to Push Chain

#### 6.1. Set up your deployer account

Following best security practices, we'll use Foundry's wallet management system instead of exposing private keys in environment variables:

```bash
cast wallet import myKeystore --interactive
```

You'll be prompted to enter your private key and create a password to encrypt it. This securely stores your key in `~/.foundry/keystores`.
Read more about [Foundry Wallet Management](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/reference/cast-wallet-import/).

:::warning
Never use accounts with significant funds for test deployments.
Never store private keys in plain text or in your repository.
:::

#### 6.2. Get testnet tokens

Ensure you have testnet tokens to pay for deployment gas fees. If you don't have any, use the Push Chain testnet faucet**.**
Visiting our [Faucet](https://faucet.push.org/).

#### 6.3. Deploy your contract

```bash
forge create src/MyToken.sol:MyToken --rpc-url push_testnet --chain 42101 --account myKeystore --broadcast
```

This command:

- Creates your MyToken contract
- Uses the Push Chain testnet RPC
- Specifies the correct chain ID (42101)
- Uses your securely stored account
- Broadcasts the transaction to the network

**Deployment Results:**

If successful, you'll see output similar to:

```
Deployer: 0xa89523351BE1e2De64937AA9AF61Ae06eAd199C7
Deployed to: 0xF0f1199A048A39336dFD915F146470de1b5d6dAd
Transaction hash: 0x255e64bbe86253979f070b48db0868f6f108a47e7b7f94586bc869fbd2d98800
```

Save the contract address for verification and interaction later.

### 7. Verify the Contract

Verify your contract on the Push Chain BlockScout explorer:

```bash
forge verify-contract --chain 42101 --verifier blockscout --verifier-url https://explorer.testnet.push.org/api 0xF0f1199A048A39336dFD915F146470de1b5d6dAd src/MyToken.sol:MyToken
```

> **Note:** Replace `0xF0f1199A048A39336dFD915F146470de1b5d6dAd` with your actual deployed contract address.

If successful, you'll see output similar to:

```
Start verifying contract `0xF0f1199A048A39336dFD915F146470de1b5d6dAd` deployed on 42101

Submitting verification for [src/MyToken.sol:MyToken] 0xF0f1199A048A39336dFD915F146470de1b5d6dAd.
Submitted contract for verification:
	Response: `OK`
	GUID: `f0f1199a048a39336dfd915f146470de1b5d6dad68494bd5`
	URL: https://explorer.testnet.push.org/address/0xf0f1199a048a39336dfd915f146470de1b5d6dad
```

Visit the provided URL to view your verified contract on the Push Chain explorer.

That's it! You have successfully deployed and verified your smart contract on Push Chain.
