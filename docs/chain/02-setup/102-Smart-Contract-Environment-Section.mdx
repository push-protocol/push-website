# Smart Contract Environment

Setting up your smart contract environment to interact with Push Chain, whether you are using Remix, Hardhat, Foundry, or any other tooling, this section will guide you through the process.

:::info Recommended Practice

Work on your smart contract exactly the same way you would on Ethereum, then use Push Chain configuration to deploy your smart contracts on Push Chain.
