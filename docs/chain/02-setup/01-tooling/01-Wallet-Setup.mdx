# Overview

It's recommended to add Push Chain as custom network to your wallet before building your app on Push Chain. This will help you to test your app on Push Chain before deploying it on mainnet.

:::note Not Required for Users

This is not a requirement for your users as they will connect to Push Chain using their wallet and through [UI Kit](/docs/chain/ui-kit) that will abstract away their wallet connection.

Add the chain specs to your favorite EVM wallet under custom network. Some of the fields are optional depending on the wallet.
