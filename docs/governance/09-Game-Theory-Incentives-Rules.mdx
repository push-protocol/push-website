# The Game Theory, Incentives & Rules

Quick overview on the game theory, the incentive mechanisms and the rules involved in the PUSH Governance.

PUSH Governance is designed keeping quality participation in mind and as a byproduct carries some incentives and penalties to keep the governance focused, active and be ever improving.

**Incentives for users whose formal draft is accepted**

-   We believe that having incentives for the users whose draft proposal are accepted will greatly improve the quality of the proposal (and quantity as well 😅) as it’s in the best interest of the user to submit a draft proposal that can go through the entire cycle and be formally accepted.
    

-   For this reason Push DAO approved and implemented  [**PIP-02: Incentives for Approved Proposals**](https://snapshot.org/#/pushdao.eth/proposal/0x1c928002d6cb8d563ff79dc06f1f28a5963f0ed81460765d937a7ad08a779215). 
    

-   To counteract the quantity of draft proposals by a user, we have introduced rules which limit the number of draft proposals that can be submitted by the user in different phases.
    

**Rules for users creating a proposal draft (Proposal Phase)**

-   Each user at [https://gov.push.org](https://gov.epns.io/) is only allowed to submit a proposal draft once every 7 days under the proposal phase. Tweaks in the proposal can still be allowed at the discretion of the Push DAO Governance Leadership unit.
    

**Rules for users creating a proposal draft (Snapshot Phase)**

-   Each user (or PUSH Delegatee) that has the required votes delegated (75k $PUSH) is only allowed to submit a valid formal proposal on Snapshot once every 7 days.
    

_Note: These rules fall under meta governance and thus can be changed by the voting process as defined above._
