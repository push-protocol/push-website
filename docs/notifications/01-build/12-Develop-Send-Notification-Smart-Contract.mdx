# Send notification using smart contract

Push contracts are designed to act as a communication middleware for your smart contracts which ensures that even smart contracts can communicate with the wallet addresses (ie: web3 users).

## Sending notifications from smart contract

### Step 1️⃣ - Locate the contract address of Push
Ensure that you know the contract address of Push Communication smart contract based on the blockchain and network from which you are sending the communication out. 

For example: Staging Ethereum contract address is `0xb3971BCef2D791bc4027BbfedFb47319A4AAaaAa`. List of all smart contract and their environment is available here 👉 [Push smart contract addresses](/docs/notifications/push-smart-contracts/contract-addresses/ "List of all relevant push protocol smart contract addresses").

### Step 2️⃣ - Import Push Comm interface
Start by importing the Push comm contract interface in your smart contract 👇

```solidity
// PUSH Comm Contract Interface
interface IPUSHCommInterface {
    function sendNotification(address _channel, address _recipient, bytes calldata _identity) external;
}
```

### Step 3️⃣ - Locate your channel address
Ensure your channel is up and running by following this guide - [Creating your channel](/docs/notifications/tutorials/create-your-channel/ "Guide explaining how to create your channel"). Note down your channel address which you need to put in the code below as **YOUR_CHANNEL_ADDRESS**.

### Step 4️⃣ - Call the contract function
Next call the function `sendNotification(address _channel, address _recipient, bytes calldata _identity)` and pass the address of the channel, recipient and the identity based on your needs.

```solidity
IPUSHCommInterface(EPNS_COMM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_FOR_SPECIFIC_BLOCKCHAIN).sendNotification(
    YOUR_CHANNEL_ADDRESS, // from channel - recommended to set channel via dApp and put it's value -> then once contract is deployed, go back and add the contract address as delegate for your channel
    to, // to recipient, put address(this) in case you want Broadcast or Subset. For Targetted put the address to which you want to send
    bytes(
        string(
            // We are passing identity here: https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-guides/sending-notifications/advanced/notification-payload-types/identity/payload-identity-implementations
            abi.encodePacked(
                "0", // this is notification identity: https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-guides/sending-notifications/advanced/notification-payload-types/identity/payload-identity-implementations
                "+", // segregator
                "3", // this is payload type: https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-guides/sending-notifications/advanced/notification-payload-types/payload (1, 3 or 4) = (Broadcast, targetted or subset)
                "+", // segregator
                "Title", // this is notificaiton title
                "+", // segregator
                "Body" // notification body
            )
        )
    )
);
```

### Step 5️⃣ - Add your smart contract address as your channel delegate
The last step is to go back to your channel and add the smart contract address as a delegate ensuring notifications sent by your smart contract are routed through your channel and presented to your users. Checkout [guide for adding delegates for Channel](/docs/notifications/tutorials/create-your-channel/#adding-delegates-for-channel "Guide to adding delegates to your channel") to understand how to add delegates to your channel.
