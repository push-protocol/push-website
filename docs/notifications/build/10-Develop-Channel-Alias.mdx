## What is Channel Alias

While we know that a channel is created on the Ethereum blockchain, it doesn't necessarily mean that notifications can only be sent on the ETH chain. The protocol is designed to make channels capable of sending notifications on any other chain. Even non-Ethereum ones!
In order to enable your channel to be blockchain-agnostic and allow multi-chain communication, we have introduced a new term called Channel Alias. This property is what enables your channel to send notifications on any other blockchain.

A channel alias address is a native representation of your Ethereum channel on any other EVM or Non-EVM chain through which you wish to communicate with your subscribers.
This means that although channel creation must happen on the Ethereum blockchain itself, notifications or communications can be carried out on any other chain through the same channel if the channel has its alias address adequately configured for that particular chain.
You can communicate with your subscribers on Polygon, BNB, etc. using an Alias address that is compatible with that respective blockchain.

## Supported Alias chains

The following chains are supported on which you can send notifications using your channel alias

- Polygon
- BNB
- Polygon zkEVM

## Get alias info API

<Tabs className="codetabs" groupId="code-examples">

const aliasInfo = await userAlice.channel.alias.info({
  alias: aliasAddress,
  aliasChain: 'POLYGON',
})
```

  </TabItem>
