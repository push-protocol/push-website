# Notification Standards Overview

All notifications passed to the network are eventually transformed to JSON payload. The following glossaries help cover some of the basics that can help in understanding what is happening and how to customize the behavior.

<head>
  <title>Notification Standards (Basic) | Push Notifications | Push Documentation</title>
</head>

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

## Important glossaries

- **Verification Proof**  - Each notification sent carries with itself a verification proof that allows the network to validate that the notification is coming from a channel or one of it's delegate. 

  :::note
  Verification Proof is handled automatically by the SDK but you if you want to, you can read about it [over here](docs/notifications/notification-standards/notification-standards-advance/#notification-verification-proof "post explaining notification verification proof in Push protocol").
  :::

- **Notification Identity** - Each notification passed to the network is actually an identity which defines how the notification is formatted, where it's stored, etc. 

  :::note
  Notification identity is abstracted away by the SDK except when invoking directly from your smart contracts. Advance section has detailed explaination about [Notification Identity](docs/notifications/notification-standards/notification-standards-advance/#notification-identity "post explaining notification identity in Push protocol").

- **Identity Type** - Defines the format in which the notification json payload is sent to the network. Common types you need to know about.

  | Identity Type | Remarks               | Description                                                     |
  | ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 0             | Minimal               | Recommended for Smart Contract                                  |
  | 2             | Direct Payload        | Recommended for PUSH SDK                                        |

- **Notification Type** - Defines the type of notification that is sent:
  - Broadcast (Type 1) - Is sent out to all the users who have opted in to your channel
  - Targeted (Type 3) - Is sent out to an individual user
  - Subset (Type 4) - Is sent out to a subset of users of your channel

- **Notification Content** - Defines the notification content which consists of:
  - Notification JSON Object - What is shown on your home screen
  - Payload JSON Object - What is shown and stored on your feed
  - Recipients - 0x0 for type 1 (broadcast), 0xTarget for type 3 (Targeted) and [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, ..., 0xN] for type 4 (Subset) 

  ```json
    // Example Raw Content for targeted notifcation, abstracted away by SDK
    {
      "notification": {
        "title": "The title of your message displayed on screen (50 Chars)",
        "body": "The intended message displayed on screen (180 Chars)"
      },
      "data": { // Is defined as payload most of the time
        "type": "3" // notification type
        "sectype": null // enables encrypted notifications
        "asub": "[Optional] The subject of the message displayed inside app (80 Chars)",
        "amsg": "[Optional] The intended message displayed inside app (500 Chars)",
        "acta": "[Optional] The cta link parsed inside the app",
        "aimg": "[Optional] The image url which is shown inside the app",
        "etime": "[Optional] if given, notif will be deleted after this in epoch"
        "hidden" :"[Optional] if given, notif will not show in user feed"
      },
        "recipients": 0xtarget
    }
  ```

  :::note
  These concepts are for your understanding as most of them are abstracted away but if you wish to dive deeper then read more about [notification payload here](docs/notifications/notification-standards/notification-standards-advance/#notification-payload "post explaining notification payload in in Push protocol").
  :::

  
- **Content Markdown** - Defines how the content markdown should be passed to enable variety of notifications. Covered in detail in the advanced section - [Notification Content](docs/notifications/notification-standards/notification-standards-advance/#notification-content "post explaining notification content and how to customize it in in Push protocol").

- **Sender** - Defines who is sending the message. The sender is the channel address or the alias address. The address should be represented in chain specific format as [depicted over here](/docs/notifications/important-concepts/#chain-specific-wallet-address "About chain specific wallet address")

  Examples:
  - Ethereum(Mainnet): `eip155:1:<Address>`
  - Ethereum(Goerli): `eip155:42:<Address>`
  - Polygon(Mumbai): `eip155:80001:<Address>`

  :::caution
  One exception to chain specific format is for smart contract to smart contract interaction (ie: [Send Notification (via smart contract)](/docs/notifications/build/send-notification-via-smart-contract/ "Send notification via smart contract")), For this specific feature, the native blockchain address is required and not chain specific format.
  :::

- **Source** - The source from which the notification is coming from. Currently supports `ETH_MAINNET`, `POLYGON_MAINNET`, `BNB_MAINNET`, `ARB_MAINNET`, `THE_GRAPH`, `ETH_GOERLI`, `POLYGON_TESTNET`, `BNB_TESTNET`.

  Source is determined [by the chain at which the user is inititialized](http://localhost:3000/docs/notifications/build/initialize-user/ "Initialize User Push SDK") from Push SDK, by the network it is coming from in case of smart contracts.

- **Recipient(s)** - The address to the notification should reach. Push supports multiple address formats as [depicted over here](/docs/notifications/important-concepts/#types-of-supported-wallet-address-account "learn about all supported wallet address account").

  Few examples:
  - Ethereum(Mainnet): `eip155:1:<Address>`
  - Ethereum(Goerli): `eip155:42:<Address>`
  - Polygon(Mumbai): `eip155:80001:<Address>`

  :::caution
  One exception to address format support is for smart contract to smart contract interaction (ie: [Send Notification (via smart contract)](/docs/notifications/build/send-notification-via-smart-contract/ "Send notification via smart contract")), For this specific feature, the native blockchain address is required. for example: `0x99A08ac6254dcf7ccc37CeC662aeba8eFA666666`

## Sending notification examples

<Tabs groupId="notification-examples">
  <TabItem value="Push SDK" default>

```typescript
// userAlice.channel.send([recipients], {options?})
// to send a broadcast notification - pass '*' in recipients array
const broadcastNotif = await userAlice.channel.send(['*'], {
  notification: { title: 'test', body: 'test' },
})

// userAlice.channel.send([recipients], {options?})
// to send a targeted notification - pass that single wallet address in recipients array
const targetedNotif = await userAlice.channel.send(['0x99A08ac6254dcf7ccc37CeC662aeba8eFA666666'], {
  notification: {
    title: 'test',
    body: 'test',
  },
})

// userAlice.channel.send([recipients], {options?})
// to send a subset notification - pass the list of wallet address in recipients array
const subsetNotif = await userAlice.channel.send(
  [randomWallet1, randomWallet2, randomWallet3],
  {
    notification: {
      title: 'test',
      body: 'test',
    },
  }
)
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Smart Contract" default>

  While any Notification Identity can be passed in any of the interactions, It's recommended to start with Identity Type 0 (Minimal) for smart contracts.

  **Format:** `0+<Notification Type>+<Title>+<Body>`

  **What to call:** `sendNotification(address _channel, address _recipient, bytes calldata _identity)`

  **Additional Rules: **
  Notification Type 1 (Broadcast): Pass recipient as _channel
  Notification Type 3 (Targeted): Pass recipient as intended recipient
  Notification Type 4 (Subset): **Not supported yet**

  **Example:**
  ```solidity
  IPUSHCommInterface(EPNS_COMM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_FOR_SPECIFIC_BLOCKCHAIN).sendNotification(
    YOUR_CHANNEL_ADDRESS, // from channel - recommended to set channel via dApp and put it's value -> then once contract is deployed, go back and add the contract address as delegate for your channel
    to, // to recipient, put address(this) in case you want Broadcast or Subset. For Targeted put the address to which you want to send
    bytes(
        string(
            // We are passing identity here: https://push.org/docs/notifications/notification-standards/notification-standards-advance/#notification-identity
            abi.encodePacked(
                "0", // this represents minimal identity, learn more: https://push.org/docs/notifications/notification-standards/notification-standards-advance/#notification-identity
                "+", // segregator
                "3", // define notification type:  https://push.org/docs/notifications/build/types-of-notification (1, 3 or 4) = (Broadcast, targeted or subset)
                "+", // segregator
                "Title", // this is notificaiton title
                "+", // segregator
                "Body" // notification body
            )
        )
    )
  );
  ```
