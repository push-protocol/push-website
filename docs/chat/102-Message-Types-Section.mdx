# Intro to Message Types

Each message of Push Chat is a json payload that carries with it a message type and some parameters that enable each frontend that integrates Push Chat to understand and display various message types.

Push Chat supports an evergrowing list message types, all of which can be sent by `chat.send`, though some require passing few additional parameters.
