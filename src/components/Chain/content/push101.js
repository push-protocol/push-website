    Push Chain addresses specific gaps in the existing blockchains, such as interoperability, state access across chains, programmable solvers and wallet abstraction resulting in a **full stack interop**. While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in their own eco-system and an aggregator to unite these chains are needed.<p />

    While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in their own eco-system and an aggregator to unite these chains are needed.<p />

    Push Chain‚Äôs focus is on being a **shared state chain** for universal applications acting as a unifying layer where all chains can come together and use PC as universal hub or do settlement between them.<p />
PC offers a new paradigm of web3 that works from **Any Chain.** For **Any Wallet/User.** And is suitable for **Any App.**`,

          value: `## What is Push Chain?

    Push Chain is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) L1 blockchain that is designed to eliminate fragmentation across all chains.<p />

    It is a **shared state L1** blockchain for **Universal (Interoperable) Apps** across chains. Push Chain enables txs from any chain (Eth, Solana, EVM, or non-EVM) enabling apps from any chain to be accessed by the users of any chain (**polymarket** from any chain, **pump.fun** from any chain, etc).`,

    Push Chain introduces some groundbreaking innovations such as:<p />

    **Fee and Wallet abstraction** - allowing wallets/users of any chain to interact natively while being on the chain of their choice.<p />

    **Universal Wallet** - ensuring user can login via social or email and still have non-custodial wallets created for them for all chains (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, etc).<p />

    **Shared State** - enabling developers to read the state of any wallet or smart contract of any other blockchain via smart contract on Push Chain.<p />

    **Programmable Solvers** - ensures that a developer can create a basic path for cross chain actions (write actions) based on the shared state.<p />

    **Universal Smart Contracts** - giving developers ability to use shared state and generalized solvers for read and write action in chain agnostic fashion. And enables users to use fees and wallet abstraction to access any app or any chain without any hassle.<p />

    Push Chain uses all these innovations to enable reading (shared state) or writing to different chains (programmable solvers), all controlled by the universal smart contract. The fee and wallet abstraction further enables a seamless, user centric approach as the learnings for a user is abstracted away no matter from what chain they chose to interact. <p/>

    This results in **fully interoperable applications** for web3. In this paradigm, instead of being a user of "Uniswap on Ethereum," "Uniswap on Polygon," or "Uniswap on Arbitrum," a person simply becomes a **user of Uniswap.**`,
