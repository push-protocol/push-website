    question: 'What is Push?',

      <Answer>
        <Span>
          Push is the world’s first blockchain-agnostic decentralised
          communication protocol for Web3. It is an open network for validating
          and indexing all sorts of communication (notifications, chats, etc)
          that can then be integrated by any crypto frontend (dApps, wallets,
          etc).
        </Span>
        <Span>
          Any smart contract, dApp, or backend service can integrate Push to
          provide a communication layer through notifications or chats that are
          tied to the wallet addresses of users.

      <Answer>
        <Span>
          Push is building the communication layer for Web3, using which any
          dApp, smart contracts or backend can send any real time communications
          (such as notifications, chats, video and more) that are tied directly
          to a user's wallet address (aka web3 usernames).
        </Span>
        <Span>
          This addresses a major gap in the web3 infrastructure, and improving
          the everyday experience for blockchain users. The notifications (or
          any other communications) are off-chain, gasless for all scenarios
          except when a smart contract sends them (in which case the smart
          contract pays a slightly higher gas fees for the payload that is sent
          on blockchain).
        </Span>
        <Span>
          While communications are encrypted and secure, they utilize Push open
          network which means any dApp or crypto wallet can easily integrate
          them making the lives of all web3 users a lot easier and more akin to
          web2 UX where apps (or protocols) communicate with their users
          whenever something of importance occurs or is about to occur for them.

        <Span>
          Push operates on network of nodes called Push Nodes which are
          responsible for the validation, storage, and delivery of notifications
          & chats.

        <Span>
          Major efforts are put into decentralising Push Nodes which is in the
          final stages now. Any content or payloads getting delivered are
          already immutable and can't be changed as they are secured using
          crypto-graphical proofs. The other part which ensures that the content
          can't be censored is in final stages now of testing and public alpha
          push nodes are expected to be rolled out soon.

      <Answer>
        <Span>
          No, Push is extremely versatile and can handle on-chain (coming from

          apart from notifications generated via sub-graphs.
        </Span>
        <Span>
          The logic of notification depends on what the xyz protocol wants to
          send to you which already ranges from a variety of use cases such as
          near loan liquidations, NFT rebids, on-chain or off chain governance,
          web3 news, airdrop alerts and so much more. If you imagine a use case
          that your users will benefit from, chances are Push will be able to
          enable dispatching those notifications to your users (wallet
          addresses).

          Push Protocol aims to achieve a circular economy for its protocol by
          engendering a communication layer that is run by the community and for
          the community. The goal is for every participant to be rewarded for
          their participation while simultaneously discouraging behaviour that
          would be detrimental to the network.
        </Span>
        <Span>
          $PUSH is the native token of Push Protocol. It achieves the circular
          economy today through four major use cases: securing the network,
          network utility, Push DAO and governance, and reward pool fee.
