To receive a specific notification a user has to set up a channel by which they can send notifications. A full guide on setting up channels can be found [here](https://docs.epns.io/users/hello-world-channel/sending-notifications). More information on EPNS DAPP can be seen [here](https://app.epns.io/#/live_walkthrough).\\n\\n\\nThe community had recently voted on and passed<b> PIP-06: Reimburse channel-creation gas fees in $PUSH on developer request</b>. The results were immensely in favor of the proposal with 1.6M votes FOR and 2.6K votes AGAINST.\\n\\nYou can now request reimbursement of 80% of your gas fee within 24 hours of the channel creation, and your Gas fee will be reimbursed into your wallet in the form of $PUSH tokens. This removes an obstruction for underfunded or hobbyist developers from opening a notification channel.\\n\\nThe process to redeem your gas fees are:\\n\\n- Dev creates a channel\\n- Announces the channel creation on the EPNS discord (use of multiple emojis preferred \ud83d\ude0a )\\n- Let the world know of your channel and tag EPNS on all of your socials when you post(preferably Twitter).\\n- Dev shares relevant details in this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNQ2_mACRQgyIPsr47woE69_FOds8aLIGupT20QIEUMfgnQw/viewform?usp=sf_link)\\n\\nThe EPNS team will review the form and send devs $PUSH relative to the market price. Note that the<b> request must be sent within 24 hours of channel creation</b>. This proposal is funded through Push Governance and was voted on in [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth/proposal/0x1fd82313d4356e5d7963c60649f0376e995cf326ff348269293026e6064e1f38).\\n\\nEPNS also offers grants to promising projects also decided by the community.
