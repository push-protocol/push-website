This requires permission on the client side. When subscribed to push notifications, a publisher can push information. This is known as the publish/subscriber model. In general, the publish/subscribe mechanism includes peers who congregate around a topic they are interested in which lives on a central server, and these peers are said to be subscribed to that topic. Whenever new content is available on one of the information channels, the server pushes that information out to the client. Typically, push notifications are pushed to a client app that a user is using from an application server. Server pushes work because of a continuously open connection between a client device or interface, and the push service. A server provided by the operating system developer acts as middleware between the service and the client device by curating the communication with the device. The device registers on the push server with a unique ID to send the right messages to the right device.
