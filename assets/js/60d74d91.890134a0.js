As such, users of Boba Network can receive decentralized push notifications pertaining to asset bridging.\\n\\n\\n## Boba Network: Ethereum Layer2 for the Masses\\nBoba Network is touted to be the people\u2019s layer-2 for Ethereum that prioritizes developers and users. At its core, it is an L2 Ethereum scaling and augmenting solution. It features extensible smart contracts that allow developers to build the next generation of DApps that invoke the web-scale infrastructure. Boba offers community-driven liquidity pools while facilitating fast exits and giving LPs incentivized yield farming opportunities.\\n\\nMoreover, the Boba Network allows faster transactions, hybrid computing, lower gas fees, and Ethereum-level security for users. Users can also seamlessly move digital assets, including NFTs from Ethereum L1 to L2. As such, this novel network can benefit from a decentralized communication channel that allows direct communication with its users to keep them updated about the various activities on the network. This is where the collaboration with Push Protocol comes into play.\\n\\n## What Does the Integration Entail?\\nThrough our integration with Boba Network, we envision the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to directly interact with its users. This channel will be housed on the Push platform and users of Boba Network can subscribe to it to receive decentralized push notifications on their devices. They can expect to receive notifications whenever:\\n\\n- Their assets are bridged into the Boba Chain\\n- Governance proposals are up for voting\\n- The results of the voting are declared\\n\\nThis allows users to grab the governance and investment opportunities on Boba Network at the right time. Push has a Chrome extension, a dapp, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.\\n\\nWe\u2019re pleased to collaborate with Boba Network on their journey and Stay tuned for more announcements in the coming week!\\n\\n<center><b>.  .  .</b></center>\\n\\n## About Boba Network\\nBoba is a \u201cMultichain \u201c L2 Ethereum scaling & augmenting solution built by the Enya team as core contributors to the OMG Foundation. It leverages Optimistic roll-up technology and allows developers to build the next generation of DApps and DeFi protocols.\\n\\nStay in touch: [Website](https://boba.network/) and [docs](https://docs.boba.network/)."}}')}}]);
