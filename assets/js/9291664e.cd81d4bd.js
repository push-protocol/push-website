However, this doesn\u2019t limit developers to use the SDK directly if a full Showrunners framework implementation is not necessary.\\n\\n\u2705 [Showrunners Framework Github](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-staging)\\n\\n### Back-end SDK in short\\n- Allows developers & protocols for easy access to EPNS common functionalities from within their backends. For instance: getSubscribedUsers and sendNotification.\\n- This SDK also comes packed with tooling for easy debugging and testing of notifications through the simulate object.\\n- npm package available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@epnsproject/backend-sdk\\n\\n\u2705 [EPNS Backend SDK Github](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-backendsdk-staging)\\n\\n### Do you want to try the EPNS Backend SDK?\\nWe have several resources for those interested in start experimenting with the Showrunners framework and the Backend SDK or contributing to them\\n\\n### Example Apps\\nTo help developers get started with the Showrunners Framework and using the new SDK, our public [Showrunners repo](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-staging) includes sample implementations that we have worked for our Pilot Program Collaborations. This repository aims to serve as a reference for a comprehensive Showrunners implementation containing both simple and complex demonstrations of how to integrate EPNS with other popular protocols and services.\\n\\n[This video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nh-HiVDc-OeNTFbYSdaDMwTmSfGwPAut/view?usp=sharing) briefly describes the implementation we worked for Uniswap to notify users when a new Governance Proposal is submitted. It also shows how to use Postman to trigger notifications for debugging and testing purposes; and how a full round-trip looks like \u2014 from the moment a new proposal is submitted until the user gets the notification in their Mobile App and click on it to view it.\\n\\n### Documentation\\n- EPNS Integration Guides Gitbook: https://app.gitbook.com/@ethereum-push-notification/s/integration-guide/\\n\\n### Stay Connected\\nIf you are interested in providing feedback and working more closely with our development team to improve EPNS for developers, we invite you to join our [Discord Community Server](https://discord.gg/nYrqZ734nu).\\n\\nAs usual, this is evergreen documentation that we will keep building, updating, and improving."}}')}}]);
