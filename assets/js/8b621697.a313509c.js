Among some of the most pressing issues: smart contract version releases are missed, liquidation thresholds are not warned, NFT drops are forgotten, and vulnerabilities aren\u2019t communicated well.

Currently, EPNS is powering on-chain notifications for ENS (domain expiration), CoinDesk (media alerts), Snapshot (governance updates), Oasis (vault liquidation), and more. Since mainnet launch in mid-January, EPNS has powered 4 million notifications sent to over 44,000 subscribers.
