This was designed to introduce a new wave of utility to the $PUSH token.\\n\\nNow with our $PUSH token launch on Polygon, we\u2019re extending that utility even further.\\n\\n## New composability, new accessibility, new utility\\n\\nFor the wide range of dApps and protocols already building on top of Push in the Polygon ecosystem, the introduction of $PUSH to Polygon will foster an even greater innovation arena for builders to come up with new projects, ideas, and utility potential.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Polygon network offers incredibly fast and cheap transactions, which makes it an ideal environment to run Push DAO operations.\\n\\nWe\u2019re extremely excited to be seeing the accessibility, usability, and composability of the $PUSH token grow!\\n\\n## Now live on QuickSwap!\\n\\n![Docusaurus Image](./cover-image2.webp)\\n\\nIn addition to the introduction of the $PUSH token to the Polygon ecosystem, we are also pleased to announce the listing of the $PUSH token on [QuickSwap!](https://quickswap.exchange/#/)\\n\\nQuickSwap is the second largest Polygon-native decentralized exchange. It\u2019s a layer-2 solution based on an AMM model that enables users to trade any ERC-20 assets with low gas fees.\\n\\nAs one of the most prominent DEXs on Polygon, QuickSwap is completely aligned with our mission of facilitating cross-chain communication. We look forward to introducing the $PUSH token to a new set of QuickSwap and Polygon users!\\n\\nLiquidity will be managed by Gamma AMM and you can stake your LP tokens to earn more rewards directly on [Gamma\u2019s farm](https://quickswap.exchange/#/farm).\\n\\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\ud83d\udc49[Provide $PUSH/WETH Liquidity here](https://quickswap.exchange/#/pools?currency0=0x58001cC1A9E17A20935079aB40B1B8f4Fc19EFd1&currency1=0x7ceB23fD6bC0adD59E62ac25578270cFf1b9f619) \ud83d\udc48\u2728\u2728\u2728\\n\\n### Let\u2019s go!\\n\\nWe are confident that launching on Polygon will help further our goals and bring our vision of decentralized communication to life.
