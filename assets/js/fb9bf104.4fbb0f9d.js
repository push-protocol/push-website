Notifications will alert users when their loans reach maturity or could become undercollateralized due to changing asset prices. Notional Finance is DeFi\u2019s leading fixed-rate protocol enabling users to borrow or lend at fixed rates for up to one year \u2014 with longer maturities coming soon.\\n\\nHow Will Notional Finance Users Benefit\\n=======================================\\n\\nThanks to the new integration, an official channel on the EPNS platform will be created that Notional Finance users can easily subscribe to. Through EPNS\u2019 mobile application, decentralized application, or Chrome Extension, Notional Finance users can choose to receive notifications whenever:\\n\\n*   **Their portfolio approaches liquidation**. This will allow users to decide if they want to add more collateral to their borrow position in order to avoid potential liquidations.\\n*   **One of their loans reaches maturity**. This will allow users to actively decide if they\u2019d like to close their borrow before maturity or to actively roll it forward to the next maturity and thus avoid incurring any penalties.\\n\\nWith fixed rate borrowing and lending available to increasingly-longer periods, busy DeFi users may need an extra \u201cpush\u201d to remember important milestones and important liquidation levels. This integration fills this need and allows for an enhanced experience and peace of mind for Notional users.EPNS provides a reliable communication mechanism that delivers real-time loan updates to users while preserving anonymity and privacy. EPNS is happy to support Notional users on their investing journey and to collaborate with Shippooor DAO to bring this integration to life.\\n\\n**About Notional Finance**\\n==========================\\n\\nNotional is a protocol on Ethereum that facilitates fixed-rate, fixed-term crypto-asset lending and borrowing through a novel financial instrument called fCash.
