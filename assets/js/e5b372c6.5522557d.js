Push Video is the first wallet-to-wallet video chat that allows web3 users to video chat with each other live. Get started at [app.push.org](https://app.push.org/chat)!\\n\\n\\nPush Protocol began with push notifications to web3 in January 2022 on Ethereum. Since then, Push has expanded to Polygon and BNB Chain. In October 2022 at Devcon in Bogota, we announced the launch of Push Chat, our wallet-to-wallet messaging protocol. Since launch, Push Protocol has powered over 30M messages to 85,000+ users across 500+ integrations.\\n\\nBuilt on the success of Push Notifications and Push Chat, we\u2019re now excited to officially release Push Video!\\n\\nThe web3 social media and chat ecosystem is expanding rapidly today, but Push Video has always been our plan. Back in our [2020 whitepaper](https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1590388512280711170?s=20), we referenced that decentralized video chat was on our timeline as a natural component to the web3 communication stack we built, starting with notifications. Also in Bogota, at Polygon Connect, we gave the community a [preview of Push Video](https://twitter.com/harshrajat/status/1579628569453813760?s=20), which was then under development. Between Bogota and today\u2019s announcement, we\u2019ve built off the success of Push Protocol notifications and Push Chat to expand the ecosystem of decentralized social networking.\\n\\n![Push Video 1](./image-1.png)\\n\\nWhat can you do with Push Video? Well, anything you do with video today. Social chats, business meetings, customer support, streaming, gaming, telehealth, education and coaching \u2014 the list goes on.\\n\\n### Launching at Pragma Tokyo, ETH Global\\n\\nBack in 2020, Push Protocol (then, EPNS) was born out of ETHGlobal 2020. Today, we are announcing Push Video during ETHGlobal in Tokyo, at the [Pragma](https://ethglobal.com/events/pragma-tokyo) event.\\n\\nAfter Push Chat, Push Video is the second major social networking product to be launched by Push Protocol. We will continue to develop these products, adding features like group and streaming. Soon in our roadmap we have web3 \u201cTwitter spaces like experience\u201d, allowing communities to come together on decentralized online forum. All of these products will be tied together by the fundamental notifications layer that we have built and scaled to date. Piece by piece, Push Protocol is building the decentralized social networking ecosystem for all users of the future internet.\\n\\n### The Push Developer Video SDK\\nThe Push Developer Video SDK is launching soon! The SDK will give app developers an easy way to start integrating decentralized notifications, chat, and/or video directly into their applications. We\u2019ll be launching the SDK imminently, so join the #dev-chat channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) to learn more.\\n\\n### How to Get Started with Push Video?\\nSending a video request and getting started with decentralized video chat is easy! Here\u2019s a step by step guide.\\n\\n<b>Step 1:</b> Head to <a href=\\"https://app.push.org/\\">app.push.org</a> and connect your MetaMask (or your preferred wallet).<br/><br/>\\n\\n<b>Step 2:</b> Click on \u201cPush Chat\u201d on the left navigation bar. Search for the recipient you want to video call with their wallet address or their ENS name.*<br/><br/>\\n\\n![Push Video 2](./image-2.png)\\n\\n![Push Video 3](./image-3.png)\\n\\n<b>Step 3:</b> Start a video call using the camera/video icon on the right side of the screen.<br/><br/>\\n\\n![Push Video 4](./image-4.png)\\n\\n*Note: You need to be friends prior to making a call. You can do this by starting a text conversation first. Once the other person accepts your message request, you\u2019re all set to have a safe & secure video call."}}')}}]);
