DAOs can be thought of as an internet-business that is managed by its community. DAOs allow the community to decide the future of the organization by submitting and voting on proposals, ensuring that everyone\u2019s voice is heard.\\n\\nSnapshot allows the community to propose and vote off-chain, meaning that users can use Snapshot to easily participate in governance without having to pay for transaction fees.\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to partner with Snapshot. With this collaboration EPNS will be creating notifications for proposals on Snapshot which will be triggered for all the token holder delegates of a specific governance project. We will also be implementing an EPIP to create a notification that can also allow these users to not only use call to action but to also sign these proposals right from the notifications if they want to.\\n\\nWorking together will also give us the opportunity to further refine our protocol, and expand its core features and functionalities to cope up with the dynamics of governance.\\n\\n**About Snapshot**\\n------------------\\n\\nSnapshot defines itself as an off-chain, gasless, multi-governance client that allows the community to create and vote on proposals as well as to verify its results. The project enables communities to run token holder votes on an off-chain level.\\n\\nThere are no charges to create a proposal and to vote on Snapshot. Proposals and votes are signed messages which are stored on IPFS.\\n\\nSnapshot is fully customizable allowing users to customize domain names, to choose a voting strategy, the proposal threshold (the minimum number of tokens required to create a proposal) and even to add the POAP plugin to reward the community members who voted in a proposal.\\n\\nFollow [Snapshot](https://twitter.com/SnapshotLabs) on Twitter"}}')}}]);
