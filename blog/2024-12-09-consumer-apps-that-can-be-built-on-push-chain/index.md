Web 3 is growing at lightning speed!

Hundreds of L1s, Thousands of L2s and soon Tens of thousands of L3s!!

While striving to make systems more scalable, decentralized and secure, we risk overlooking a crucial goal - **To expand the boundaries of web3 for all users.**

And with increasing fragmentation coupled with complex pre-requisites to interact on-chain, inflexible infrastructure for consumer apps, and a lack of chain unification, the barrier to entry is rising, leading to the emergence of more closed and isolated systems.

But not anymore.

**Introducing Push Chain - A shared state blockchain for shared app experiences!**

## What is Push Chain?

Push Chain is a Proof of Stake shared state blockchain designed to support the development of hyper-scalable, consumer-centric, universal web3 applications by unifying settlement from any L1s, L2s and L3s.

### Push Chain Superpowers Include:

- **Any Chain Tx (Solana, Eth, EVM, or non-EVM)**⛓️ :
    - Enables cross-chain transactions from EVM, Solana or any nonEVM by accepting signed payloads verified by Push validator nodes.
- **Sub-second finality ⚡⏱️ :**
    - With parallel validators and parallel attestation.
- **True Scale 🚀 :**
    - Increases both read and write throughput as the number of nodes in the network grows.
- **Fee Abstraction**💰 :
    - Non-push chain wallets can seamlessly pay fees through native token swaps, delegation, web3 applications, or the traditional wallet-pays-fees model.
- **Wallet Abstraction**  🔐 :
    - Simplify blockchain access by offering social logins, phone or email authentication, and secure recovery.
- **Consumer tx (unordered) and Traditional tx (ordered)** 🛍️:
    - Introduces *'consumer transactions'* for unordered, high-speed scalability, leveraging parallel execution, and dynamic sharding.
- **Universal Smart Contract** 🌐 :
    - Smart contracts that can read the state of EVM or non-EVM wallets of other chains in the future, enabling developers to create a seamless universal app.
- **Shared App Experience** 🤝 :
    - App experiences shared by all users of all chains

**Push Chain is purpose-built to power onchain AI**, leveraging shared state, fast finality, dynamic sharding, and cross-chain compatibility. It supports scalable, versatile AI use cases and seamless consumer experiences, enabling AI agents, marketplaces and more, *check examples below.*

**We are building Push Chain with the vision of enabling users, irrespective of what blockchain they are on to seamlessly connect with web3 applications across any blockchain.**

## Push Chain Roadmap: Phases 1, 2 and 3

Push Chain’s development follows a phased approach:

1. **Phase-1:** Focuses on creating an infrastructure tailored for consumer-centric applications  — enables building true scale apps, supports transaction from any chain, vm for smarter / complex applications, consumer transaction (ordering is not important), fees abstraction - enabling fees from a chain of user choice or from web3 app, wallet abstraction - social login and login from any other chain.
2. **Phase-2:** Establishes seamless interoperability between blockchains, enabling instant cross-chain transactions and the transfer of value and smart contract calls. This phase introduces a solver network designed to enhance user experience by abstracting on-chain complexities by facilitating hyper-scalable and universal applications
3. **Phase-3:** Introduces Universal smart contract and shared state — enabling seamless cross-blockchain interactions and making other chain’s state accessible on Push Chain and unlocking the era of universal apps.
    
    

## Push Chain gives you a Billion Reasons to Build!

Push Chain is your go-to chain for building universal mixed apps!

Here’s a brief glimpse of the future of web3 and the countless innovations that you can make happen because of Push Chain.

### →Universal AI Apps:

Build on-chain Ai agents and platforms that are not bound to any single-chain and operate across chains autonomously using Push Chain’s shared state and Universal Smart Contract capabilies.

Examples include:

**→ Unified Data Layers for AI Agents:**

- Ai agents often need to access, analyze, and react to a large variety of onchain and offchain data.
- Using Push Chain's unified user identity (**Push ID**), AI agents can retrieve a user's aggregated state from multiple chains—assets, past activities, communication history, and more.

**→ Chain Agnostic Autonomous Actions:**

- Using interoperability and knowledge of multiple user wallets across chains, an AI agent could rebalance a user's DeFi positions on Ethereum, list NFTs on Polygon, and communicate status updates to the user via a messaging app on another chain, all through one unified settlement layer.

**→ Universal AI Launchpads** 🚀

- One unified platform to launch agents across any chain
- Universal payment acceptance (any token from any chain)
- Can be scaled to support thousands of concurrent agent operations

### **Universal Social Apps**

Push Chain’s scalability as well as fee and wallet abstraction make it ideal for building decentralized social platforms.

- **Unifies all on-chain users** (quite literally) spread across all chains into one shared layer.
- **Leverage Push Chain’s sub second finality** to build next-generation social apps such as social investing platforms (e.g., GoFundMe or grants), decentralized alternatives to Reddit, Telegram, or TikTok, and other social networks.
- **Enable** **Core social app features** - replies, likes, and user connections using  unordered transactions (consumer transactions).
- **Using PushID** - A Polygon wallet can communicate and interact with a Solana Wallet, all under one shared state!
- Enable Login with any wallet or Web2 credentials (session keys)
- **Social Rewards Apps**: Create apps where users earn rewards for engagement, such as likes, shares, or creating valuable content.

### **Universal Prediction Markets** ⚖️

Prediction markets like [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) (native to Polygon only)- have already achieved mainstream PMF. Take it a step further and build cross-chain  Prediction markets where:

- Markets aggregate liquidity from all chains simultaneously
- Users participate from any wallet (ETH, SOL, etc.) without manually bridging!
- Fee abstraction allows platforms to cover gas costs for users.
