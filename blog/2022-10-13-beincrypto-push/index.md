<SubHeader>Push and BeInCrypto join forces to bring decentralized communication to the platform.
</SubHeader><br/>

[BeInCrypto](https://beincrypto.com/), one of the most popular cryptocurrency news websites, strikes a strategic alliance with Push to deliver the daily dose of news directly to readers’ wallets. This alliance will end the readers’ reliance on centralized platforms for information and enables decentralized communication between the platform and readers.

## Bringing Transparency to the Information Industry
Founded in 2018, BeInCrypto is a cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused news website that aims to spread awareness and education and bring transparency to the emerging industry. The website covers all related topics, from daily crypto updates to crypto technology and fintech.

It is the perfect platform for crypto enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, researchers, and investors to learn, research, and stay on top of the industry. In an emerging industry that is prone to false information, unlabelled sponsored posts, and paid news, BeInCrypto aims to deliver data-backed and objective pieces of information to its readers.

The platform curates, analyses, and delivers industry updates to its readers in an easily digestible manner. However, the platform currently relies on centralized communication and aims to establish decentralized communication with its readers.

This is where Push Protocol comes into play.

## Push Connects Beincrypto Directly to Its Hundreds of Thousands of Readers
The strategic collaboration between Push and BeInCyrpto will allow the news website to deliver news and updates directly to readers’ web3 wallets in a decentralized fashion. Readers who subscribe to the BeInCrypto channel will receive that news right in their inboxes. This saves them the hassle of manually checking the website and also ends their dependency on centralized platforms.

As BeInCrypto continues to provide readers with only the highest-quality content about the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, we’re very excited to collaborate with them on this journey. We hope to incorporate more use cases in the near future and become an integral part of the platform’s operations. Stay tuned for more announcements in the coming week!
