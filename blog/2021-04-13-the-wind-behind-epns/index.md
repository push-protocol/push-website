They say there is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. Only a year ago, EPNS introduced a decentralized protocol for sending notifications — **the missing piece of Web 3!!**

Today, we’re thrilled to announce the big day is here — **Launch of EPNS $PUSH** 🔔 🎉 , the [native governance token](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-token-economics-d7f566c29b1a) of the EPNS protocol. We wanted to take a moment to say **Thank you** for the amazing support! We ❤️ you 3000, hope you know that 🙂.

The genesis of $PUSH happened few days ago, [0xf418588522d5dd018b425E472991E52EBBeEEEEE](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf418588522d5dd018b425e472991e52ebbeeeeee), following our $PUSH [token generation event](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/announcing-the-epns-push-token-generation-event-4d1699e716f5).

Let’s do a Recap
----------------

Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced the completion of our 10x oversubscribed [extended seed](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-closes-10x-oversubscribed-extended-seed-round-ae03c60ae0f8) round, which followed our [initial seed round](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/ethereum-push-notification-service-successfully-raises-750k-usd-in-seed-round-bec41eadd84d). We raised $1.41 Million USD from the 2 rounds with support from top blockchain VC’s and Web3 angel investors. A few highlights of our journey so far.

*   We’re backed by 35+ top VCs and Web3 Angel investors including **Balaji Srinivasan**, **True Ventures**, **Binance** **Labs**, **IOSG**, **BitScale**, **Bixin**, **Kenneth** **Ng** (Ethereum Foundation), **Sandeep** **Nailwal** (Co-founder, Polygon), **Mariano** **Conti**, **Anthony** **Sassano**, **DeFiDad**, **Ajit** **Tripathi**, **Scott** **Moore** (Gitcoin Co-founder), **Ravindra** (Frontier Wallet), **Preethi** **Kasireddy**, **Auryn** **Macmillan** (Gnosis), **Luka** **Sucic**, **TheLAO**, **MetaCartel** **VC**, **Fourth** **Revolution** **Capital**, **Moonwhale** **Ventures**, **D64** **Ventures**, **LD** **Capital**, **BR** **Capital** and [more](https://epns.io/).

**EPNS Collabs and Pilot Programs**
-----------------------------------

We’re excited to collaborate with some of the most innovative teams in the space. Each new collab and pilot program introduces a practical and innovative new use case for decentralized push notifications. Recent partnerships and pilot programs include:

[**Uniswap**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/accelerating-defi-with-epns-f2cbfaa33c91) — Our pilot collab with Uniswap includes building a channel for them which users can subscribe to and start receiving notifications when their transactions have been approved, warning them about gas costs, notifying them of impermanent loss, and much more.

As we continue to build the EPNS protocol, we expect to develop many more exciting new use cases and collaborate with awesome teams at the intersection of decentralized services and push notifications to make all of our lives, through our wallets, more efficient and secure — business, personal, and social.

Stay tuned for further updates! And thanks for being part of our journey 💖
