April 2021 will always have a special place in our hearts 💖. It marks the pinnacle of an effort that started a little more than a year ago, and it also marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey towards bringing Web3 notifications to the Ethereum ecosystem.

Let’s take a look at all things that took place over this month!

Milestone: Token Generation Event 👏
------------------------------------

A gigantic part of this milestone is thanks to the support and feedback from our beloved community, and our awesome investors and advisors.

Putting together so many initiatives to guarantee an awesome launch was not an easy task. And while many of these strategies were moving pieces that we started working on since last month… this month it was time to assemble!

Step one during the Token Genesis compromised a meticulous development, testing, and [auditing](https://epns.io/EPNS-release-Audit.pdf) of our token, time lock, vesting, and staking smart contracts. Followed shortly by:

EPNS $PUSH listing & Rewards Program
------------------------------------

Our listings phase started with our IDO on Polkastarter and caught a massive attention and participation from the community. Later on the same day we were rolling with our listing in Uniswap and our ETH-PUSH pool up & running. And just a couple of days after, our listing in **WazirX** (India’s largest exchange).

All this setting the stage for the successful launch of the [**EPNS Rewards Program**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-push-liquidity-rewards-program-d16ff2c0fef4), offering a total of 5,510,000 $PUSH to be distributed along the program and ending on 15th March 2023.

The [incentives website](http://incentives.epns.io/) launched with two pools: The PUSH Staking Pool, and the Uniswap LP Pool; allowing users to participate in yield farming and liquidity mining opportunities, and to enjoy awesome APYs — especially for early participants!.

Gratitude Drop & ROCKSTARS of EPNS
----------------------------------

To thank the community and early advisors & supporters for being with us in every step of this journey, we decided to show a token of our appreciation to all those who donated to us on Gitcoin Rounds 6 and 7, and also to all early protocol users (snapshot as of 20th March, 2021).

But it doesn’t end there! With our [ROCKSTARS of EPNS](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf) NFT collection, we also want to express our gratitude to our early backers that have helped us get where we are, and offer the opportunity for community members to collaborate in different ways to own one piece of this prestigious collection.

The EPNS 2021 Roadmap 🌍
========================

![Third Image of EPNS Monthly Blocks](./image-3.webp)

We just released to the public our [Roadmap for 2021](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12). Learn how we envision extending all our product offering to further develop EPNS.

Get a grasp on what’s coming in regards to:

*   Protocol improvements and new features
*   Governance
*   Tooling for the developers community
*   New functionalities for the dApp, Mobile App, and a Browser Extension.
*   Showrunners new capabilities

And how we are planning to create an incentivized network of PUSH nodes!

Development Updates
===================

While all the things mentioned above were happening, a lot of interesting things were taking place in this side of the fence.

Let’s start with an update on our Pilot Program Collaborations:

Uniswap
-------

We’ve been building a channel for Uniswap aiming to revamp the way governance proposals have been communicated to all participants. With this channel users will receive a notification directly to their wallet as soon as a new proposal is added or updated.

Alpha Homora
------------

Alpha Homora’s implementation of EPNS is initially focused on notifying users about upcoming liquidation of leveraged positions. This will bring users the opportunity to react immediately and not risk losing their assets.

Unstoppable Domains
-------------------

Late last month we started integrating .crypto domains to our EPNS products and this month is a reality. You can now replace long wallet addresses with your own .crypto domain name.

Aside from the Pilot Program Collaborations, throughout this month we have experienced an exponential growth in users subscribing to our channels and using our products — **yay!!**, and it has helped us pin-point some areas of improvement that the development team have been working on diligently to ensure we are creating infrastructure that is solid and scalable to support all the great stuff coming our way.
