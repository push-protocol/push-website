Welcome to another exciting month at Push Protocol!

While there‚Äôs a lot to get through, there is one announcement that stands out and we think is worthwhile giving extra attention.

As we‚Äôve been busy expanding our reach, adding to our suite of decentralized communication tools, and working to revolutionize web3 communication, April hosted the release of our latest development. Introducing [Push Video Chat](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1646483829287182339) ‚Äî a groundbreaking wallet-to-wallet video chat that allows web3 users to connect in real time.

We‚Äôre extremely excited for the new opportunities Push Video Chat presents ‚Äî so let‚Äôs now dive deeper into everything else that happened at Push in April.

## Developmentüõ†Ô∏è

The [launch of Push Video](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-launches-wallet-to-wallet-video-chat-3240f3c6bf8) is revolutionizing communication in web3 by allowing a whole new generation of functionality to web3 projects. We‚Äôre excited to see all the innovations that will follow. In the pipeline are plans to add features like group video chat, video streaming, and a web3 social audio experience for decentralized online forums. With these developments, Push Protocol aims to build a decentralized social networking ecosystem for the internet of the future.

There‚Äôs more! Push team has been hard at work on several other exciting developments, including:

- Dapp and Mobile App optimizations
- SDK: Added more functionalities and fixed bugs
- Time-bound channels feature has gone live
- Push Chat AI Bot is coming soon
- Group chat feature improvements and optimizations are in their final stages
- Final QA of Push Video feature will be completed soon

## Frens of Push & Ecosystem Growthüå±

Our commitment to collaborate with other projects in the web3 ecosystem keeps growing, and we are thrilled to have made some exciting new frens this month.

We are delighted to announce our collaboration with [Polygon zkEVM](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1640396503029104640?s=20), bringing zkEVM notifications and Chat to users soon.
