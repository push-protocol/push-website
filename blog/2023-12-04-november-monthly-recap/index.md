Welcome to last month’s developments and new product releases from the month of November! From groundbreaking developments to new frenships, making notable appearances, and celebrating our community – it's been a month of milestones. Read on to know all that we’ve been up to this month:

### Development

Our [Notification Settings](https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings/) feature has arrived, offering both channel owners and subscribers new customization options. Channel owners can now create unlimited notification categories to better segment notifications, while subscribers can select the kinds of notifications they want to opt-in for.

We also rolled out the [Conditional Gating feature for Group Chats](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/build/conditional-rules-for-group/). Using predefined conditions such as holding a certain NFT, token, or activity history, you can enable and restrict which wallets can and can’t access a given activity/channel. Dive into our comprehensive [thread](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1724470355031429628) to discover how this functionality works.

### Frens of Push

In the spirit of collaboration, Push joined forces with some amazing partners in November:
