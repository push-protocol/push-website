<!--truncate-->

We're excited to announce that Guild-Gated Group Chats are now available on [Push](https://app.push.org/welcome). 

Previously, Push’s Group Chats could only get gated by tokens or NFTs. Now any [guild](https://guild.xyz/explorer) that is live on Guild.xyz can start a Push-based group chat. This moves us closer to our vision of ensuring customizable support for all forms of group conversations. 

As we’ve always down, we’re not just talking the talk, we’re walking the walk as well, having launched the first guild-gated group chat on Push. Here is a quick step-by-step guide on how to join it: 

1. Visit to https://guild.xyz/push-protocol-463d3f 
2.  On this page, connect a wallet you own, like MetaMask.
3. Complete the tasks mentioned and once you’re done, you will gain the Push Builders’ role for deeper access to our Guild-Gated Group Chat.
4. Click the dedicated URL that’s now unlocked to join the chat. 
5. Congratulations you just joined the Push Guild Gated Group Chat community. Don’t forget to drop a gm and connect with fellow other group chat members.

### What is Guild.xyz?

Guild serves as the foundation for platform-agnostic access management to on-chain and off-chain communities. It enables the creation of portable memberships and social structures that encompass both on-chain and off-chain requirements, allowing for the development of distinct user journeys across various applications. 

[Here](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/build/conditional-rules-for-group/#guild-gated-group-example) are some examples of how you can create gated group chats for guilds at guild.xyz using GUILD type-in criteria.
