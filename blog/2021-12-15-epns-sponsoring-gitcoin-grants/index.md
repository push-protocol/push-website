The bond between EPNS and Gitcoin has been ever-growing since its inception in Gitcoin KERNEL, where EPNS was incubated and molded in our early days. In addition to all the early support we‚Äôve received from the Gitcoin team, we are also indebted to the community for believing in us. Our existing collab with Gitcoin, which was [announced earlier this year](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/gitcoin-growing-open-source-using-web3-notifs-36a9ec6e97dc), focuses on the EPNS platform to deliver notifications during the grants process, which would help in connecting grantees and grantors.

Our story from grantee to grantors ‚ù§

Moreover, the Gitcoin community has also supported EPNS immensely in the past, notably back in Grants Round 7 where EPNS was one among the top 5 projects during the round with over 210 contributors! We couldn‚Äôt believe the faith, enthusiasm, and excitement that we received from within the Gitcoin and wider Ethereum community. It was wholesome and we are truly grateful to everyone who backed and supported us.

Since then, EPNS has grown immensely with a successful seed round and collaboration with not only Gitcoin but many major Web3 protocols in the space today. Using the platform set up by this wonderful community, we were able to take the opportunity to give back to them by successfully sponsoring Gitcoin‚Äôs Grants Round 11 (GR11) and now the opportunity to sponsor Grant‚Äôs Round 12 (GR12)!

We are incredibly excited to help early projects looking for community support just like we were once during our early days.

We believe in the future of an open, free, and public web3.0 and are glad to be able to play part in supporting others who are building towards the same goal.
