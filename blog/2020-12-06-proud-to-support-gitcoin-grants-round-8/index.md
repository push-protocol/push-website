# About Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)

EPNS is a decentralized notifications protocol which enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications. Using the protocol, any dApp, smart contract or service can send notifications to users(wallet addresses) in a platform agnostic fashion (mobile, web, or user wallets). The DeFi aspect of the protocol also ensures that the user receives and earns from those notifications.
