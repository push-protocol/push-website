Welcome to another thrilling month at Push!

October has been a month of incredible development, thought-provoking discussions, and community expansion. With so many exciting updates to get through, we're eager to share the highlights of this month in our recap. Letâ€™s get to it.

## Development

We've been hard at work enhancing the Push UX for builders. Our [Push Docs](https://comms.push.org/docs/) have received a major revamp making it easier than ever to build with Push. Some of the exciting new features include:

- Unified API for notifications & chat
- Live playground & code examples
- Object-based APIs
- Integration time reduced to less than 5 minutes

And that's not all! We're thrilled to announce that a new notification settings feature is in the works. Stay tuned for more details on this exciting development!
