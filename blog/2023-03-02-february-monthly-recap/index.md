Welcome to our monthly update for February!

What a month this was for Push. From our massive launch on BNBChain to releasing Push Delivery Nodes, Push Chat, and Push Group Chat. Needless to say, weâ€™ve been busy.

Hereâ€™s a look at everything that went onðŸ¤©

## Development

Our commitment to building a better web3 ecosystem through communication tools is unrelenting â€” and we made significant strides toward achieving this goal in this last month. Weâ€™re excited to share with you two significant developments.

<b>First</b>, our launch on <a href="https://x.com/PushChain/status/1625812049379971073">BNB Chain</a>, which marked an important milestone in our journey of becoming the web3 communication layer. We couldnâ€™t have been more thrilled to have eight fantastic collaborators join us in this launch. With these collaborations, we were able to bring our vision of a better user experience to life for the BNB ecosystem.<br/><br/>

<b>Our second</b> major development is set to transform the web3 messaging experience forever. The <a href="https://medium.com/push-protocol/launching-the-future-of-web3-messaging-with-push-chat-push-group-chat-de4cb7a65231">public launch of Push Chat and Push Group Chat</a> opens speedy wallet-to-wallet communication services to everyone. As a result, web3 users can enjoy a seamless, secure, and private messaging experience.<br/><br/>
