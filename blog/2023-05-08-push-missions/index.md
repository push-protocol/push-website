# Web3, we are ready for lift-off! Today, we are launching a new Program for our community to get more involved with Push Protocol.<br/>

The Web3 ecosystem is continuously evolving, and the Push Missions program is an innovative initiative designed to engage and empower our community to help shape its future.

Push Missions offer exciting challenges and rewards to participants who contribute to the growth of the [Push Protocol](https://push.org/) by solving technical or brand awareness missions.

If you are eager to be part of this movement, read on to learn more about the program, its structure, and how you can participate.

## What are Push Missions?

Push Missions foster collaboration, innovation, and problem-solving within the Push Web3 community. The program offers a diverse range of tasks and challenges that participants can tackle in exchange for rewards in $PUSH tokens. These missions are designed to cater to various domains within the Push Protocol ecosystem; few references of what missions will look like:

1. <b>Tutorials and Educational Content:</b> Create written or video tutorials on integrating Push Protocol with dApps, setting up a delivery node, or using custom notification triggers. Write blog posts comparing Push Protocol to similar Web3 protocols or discussing the future of decentralized communication.
2. <b>Translation and Localization:</b> Translate Push Protocol documentation into different languages to expand its accessibility to a global audience.
3. <b>Community Engagement:</b> Organize local meetups, workshops, webinars, or panel discussions on Push Protocol, both online and in-person. Host podcast episodes discussing the impact of Push Protocol on Web3 communication or participate in the development of PIPs (Push Improvement Proposals).
4. <b>Creative Content:</b> Develop infographics, explainer videos, or video demos showcasing the benefits, use cases, and architecture of Push Protocol. Design stickers, emojis, or other visual elements for the Push Protocol community.
5. <b>Development and Integration:</b> Create smart contract templates with Push Protocol integration, develop Telegram or Discord bots for delivering notifications, or build simple games that integrate Push Protocol notifications.
6. <b>Case Studies and Research:</b> Write case studies on real-world implementations of Push Protocol or research papers on its privacy and security aspects.
7. <b>Push Chat Specific Missions:</b> Create custom stickers and emojis for use within Push Chat, develop tools for analyzing and visualizing conversation data or for helping users find and join relevant groups or channels, or enable in-chat voting and polling using the Push Chat SDK.

Participants can choose from a wide variety of tasks and earn rewards based on the complexity and value of the mission. Push Missions are open on a rolling basis, meaning new missions are continually added and open for participation. By offering a broad range of mission types, the program encourages individuals with diverse skill sets to contribute their talents and expertise to the growth and success of the Push Protocol ecosystem.
