### Development üèóÔ∏è

The development shop have been working non-stop on several different items. Not only new feature development, but also fine turning and optimization to ensure we are ready to scale and fulfill the most demanding needs of the web3.

Let‚Äôs go over some of the optimizations first:

- Push Nodes optimization and standardization to improve performance is in the works.
- The initial draft for the public Analytics Dashboard is coming along nicely and very soon will go LIVE.
- The all-new user interface of the EPNS Browser extension is live on Prod now.
- The sign-out feature of the Mobile App is going LIVE soon.

Now, new features is something we continuously work on based on research and feedback from our collaborators and community:

- New DAPP features that allows channel owners to preview notifications and view the list of all delegates of the channel. Going Live soon!
- Web Sockets are live in a Staging environment, and in preparation to go to Prod.
- Send notifications through [subgraph](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1533226971743899648?s=20&t=j8CeYXy-_t5LXS8C2Ruaow) is now LIVE!
- Wallet-To-Wallet communication have been making great strides this month. In the final development stage for the frontend part, and great progress in the backend as well.

This month we also announced that <b>EPNS Core Smart Contracts v1.5</b> is in audit . This version shall include new features like time-bound channels, reward claiming functions etc.

Finally, given our big focus on the developer community, this month we hosted a [two-day virtual workshop for developers](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1537747598563454977?s=20&amp%3Bt=5sCBA1L66oeSknEf2daTsA&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) on EPNS basics & building a dApp, and had a wonderful time sharing with all hackers from [ETH NYC](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1541466249825091584?s=20&t=im07nJLlpEmhWljYo73dHA).
