Welcome to another exciting month at Push!

As we reflect on the past few weeks, we are thrilled to share some of the major milestones we‚Äôve achieved in the world of decentralized communication. From the introduction of exciting new Push Chat and Notification features to the highly anticipated launch of Push Chat Mobile, we‚Äôve been working hard to enhance the Push Protocol.

Let‚Äôs take a dive into everything that happened in March!

## Development

We‚Äôve been working hard to add new features and enhancements that will take your Push experience to the next level.

The big news of the month is that web3 messaging via [Push Chat is now available on mobile](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1636049622522298369?s=20). Staying connected on-the-go has never been easier! With this new functionality, we‚Äôre taking a big step forward in enhancing user-to-user communication in web3 and excited to see the ways users and protocols begin using it.

But that‚Äôs not all! We‚Äôve also been making progress on several other exciting developments, including:

- Push Smart Contracts V2 security audit is currently under progress
- We‚Äôre constantly striving to improve our products which means working on new features in Group Chat as well as Push Dapp optimizations
- We‚Äôre also working on optimization and code refactoring for Push Nodes and adding more test cases to the Push SDK
- We‚Äôre in the process of migrating our documentation to Docusaurus
- Released [v1.5 of Push Channels](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1636759302408122368?s=20) so you can now modify your channel details after the channel is live. Customize your channels as you like!
- Push smart contracts v2 security audit is at its final stages
- Duplicate notification issues in the Push browser extension have been fixed and the updated version is deployed

As we continue to make progress on the development front, we‚Äôre also expanding our reach through exciting collaborations with some of the biggest names in web3.

## Frens of Push

Our focus on collaboration with other projects and teams in the web3 ecosystem continues to grow as we had the pleasure of bringing some awesome new frens into the Push fam this month.

- We‚Äôre honored to be [partnering with Script Network](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1636729111061331968?s=20) as their chosen decentralized comms partner, and we can‚Äôt wait to see what we can achieve together.
