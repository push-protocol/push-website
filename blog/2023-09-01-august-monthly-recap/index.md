Step into the newest chapter of our Push journey!

August brought a wave of excitement and progress, full of achievements we can‚Äôt wait to share with you. Get ready to dive into the world of Push as we unwrap the highlights from this last month.

## Development‚öíÔ∏è

We are beyond thrilled to have fully [released PushV2](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1686783974373216256), a huge leap forward in the way of democratizing web3 communication. With PushV2, we‚Äôre introducing a host of new features that will revolutionize interactions on the platform, such as incentivized chats, Push Spaces, customized profiles, and new PushV2 Rewards for token holders.

Speaking of rewards, the [Push Liquidity Rewards V2](https://medium.com/push-protocol/new-push-yield-farming-rewards-full-details-4a9ff473226d) are bringing enhanced incentives for token holders and liquidity providers with 2 new liquidity reward pools:

1. UNI-v2 LP Token Staking: allowing users to stake their UNI-v2 LP tokens in our staking contract and earn $PUSH tokens as a reward.
2. Push Fee Pool Staking: allowing users to directly stake in the core contract itself and earn rewards in $PUSH for fees collected.

Migrating from the v1 staking pool to the new v2 staking pool has been made effortless. Find all the information about staking, harvesting, and migrating from v1 in our guide: [Staking Migration Guide for Push V2 Rewards Program](https://medium.com/push-protocol/staking-migration-guide-for-pushv2-rewards-program-f0228ddd36fc).
