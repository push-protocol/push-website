Welcome back to "Frens of Push‚Äù- a deep dive into the top protocols and Push ecosystem partners. This week, we're joined by Roseon, a leading AI-powered cryptocurrency exchange.

Roseon is the ultimate crypto ecosystem prioritizing user experience and gamification. It includes RoseonX, an AI-driven exchange with a modular architecture, and DeFi SuperApp, a one-stop mobile crypto app. With over 330K+ users and a global reach of 750K, it aims to boost crypto adoption and optimize investments.

By way of this collaboration, Push helps Roseon keep its users in the loop by sending important updates like order executions & liquidation directly to their wallets, [RoseonX Notification Channel](http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE). Roseon is also working on adding Push notifications to RoseonX, so users can get updates right on the platform.

In this episode of ‚ÄúFrens of Push‚Äù, Elle - Marketing Executive at Roseon joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push and Roseon has the potential to change the way we communicate in web3.

**1. Hi Elle, what‚Äôs your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?**

Hello everyone, this is Elle, and I work as Marketing Exec at Roseon. My fascination with blockchain and cryptography sparked in 2021, and it truly felt like stepping into a whole new world. Fast forward to today, and I‚Äôm thrilled to be part of the incredible team at Roseon. Who would've thought that my curiosity would lead me here? Life works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?

**2. Tell us about Roseon Exchange ‚Äî what‚Äôs it about and what problem does Roseon solve?**

RoseonX is an AI-powered exchange with Modular Architecture. So, to give you the full story, it all started with the goal of bridging the gap between CeFi and DeFi, making crypto easily accessible. Our first mobile crypto app, RoseonApp, boasts over 300,000 registered users, with a peak of 20,000 daily active users. We were proud to be ranked among the Top 9 stars in BNB Chain Web3 Stars Accelerator Vietnam.

Fueled by our visionary spirit, we made a strategic decision to pivot and delve into the development of our second product, RoseonX - initially a Gamified Derivatives DEX. Our approach embraces gamification, injecting a fresh level of engagement, fun, and excitement into crypto earning, trading, and DeFi in general. More recently, our whitepaper has evolved with the integration of AI, Copy Trading, and the Strategy Vault, transforming RoseonX into an AI Powered Exchange with Modular Architecture. This leap is geared towards enhancing the overall user experience in trading and other DeFi activities. Coupled with a friendly UI/UX, our aim is to drive mass adoption of our platform.

We're thrilled about the direction RoseonX is taking, and we're excited to bring this innovative approach to the world of crypto and DeFi.

**3. What‚Äôs the 2024 plan for Roseon Exchange and its ecosystem?**

Our primary aim is to bring our new roadmap to life, complete with the AI Layer, Copy Trade, Strategy Vault, and more, as well as the official release of RoseonX.

**4. How is the Roseon Exchange using Push‚Äôs web3 communication layer?**

At present, RoseonX users stay informed about updates through the Push feature by opting into [RoseonX channels](http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE). We're also in the process of integrating Push directly into RoseonX, allowing users to receive notifications right within our DEX.

**5. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?**

We've had community members share how the Push feature has been really helpful for them, as it keeps them directly informed through their MetaMask wallet.

**6. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?**

I'm genuinely excited about the Push chat between wallets. It's such a cool feature, especially with all the functionalities like group chat, video calls, spaces, and streaming. This feature has the potential to bring a whole new level of interaction and convenience to users, and I can't wait to see it in action.
