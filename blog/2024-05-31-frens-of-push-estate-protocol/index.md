We're back with Frens of Push, offering a deep dive into the top protocols and Push ecosystem partners. This week, Estate Protocol is joining us, the leading tokenized real estate marketplace on the Arbitrum blockchain.

[Estate Protocol](https://www.estateprotocol.com/) is bridging the gap between the tangible world of real estate and the boundless possibilities of the digital world by tokenizing real-world real estate, transforming properties into fractionalized digital assets through blockchain technology, ensuring security, transparency, and efficiency.

By way of this collaboration, Push assists Estate Protocol in notifying users directly on their wallets. Users can subscribe to receive notifications about new property listings, rent collection updates, and other important news. This integration ensures that users are always informed about the latest developments and opportunities within the platform, enhancing their overall experience.

In this episode of “Frens of Push”, Parv Prabhakar, CEO of Estate Protocol, joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push Protocol and Estate Protocol can potentially disrupt real estate investing.

### Hi Parv, what’s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?

I have a research and crypto background. I’ve been using digital currency in some form since I was 12 years old and was playing zynga poker on facebook selling chips for real money.

I got into crypto shortly after, buying my first bitcoin on local bitcoins. I then got deeper and deeper into the tech and the finance side of it, developing arbitrage strategies. Did that across platforms and payment methods for a couple of years, and then started traveling the world and discovered cross-country strategies. Did a 300x during the 2021 bull run with delta neutral bets.

I was also into writing at this time, and this Dutch art collective asked me to write an essay going into NFTs in detail about 3 years ago, during the research for it it hit me that this technology is perfect for digitizing ownership in real estate. So I started researching about how to make it happen alongside my job as a guest writer for India’s biggest crypto exchange WazirX, wrote the white paper for Estate Protocol, got some peers to review and advice, and then quit the job to build this full time. The business evolved way past using NFTs too.

The time with Estate Protocol since then has been incredible. We tokenized the first properties in Dubai, and are working on many new innovations in the space.

### Tell us about Estate Protocol — what’s it about and what problem does it solve?

Estate Protocol is changing the global real estate market by leveraging blockchain and UK trust law to tokenize assets, and stablecoins to facilitate seamless cross-border transactions. We tokenize the world’s most in demand real estate, fractionalize the ownership, and make it a part of DeFi in a compliant manner. We would soon enable lending/borrowing, and bring large REITs on the platform.

### What’s the 2024 plan for Estate Protocol and its ecosystem?

We are working on bringing the world’s best real estate on chain. As crypto natives, we would also be making it compatible with DeFi as far as possible. There are also some exciting partnerships currently being worked on!

### How is the Estate Protocol using Push’s web3 communication layer?

Estate Protocol utilizes Push’s web3 communication layer to notify our users directly on their wallets. Users can [subscribe](https://app.push.org/channels/0x2A43cB483361FB5b3a09Bd11c24CbEE5cf1BE7Ca) to receive notifications about new property listings, rent collection updates, and other important news. This integration ensures that our users are always informed about the latest developments and opportunities within our platform, enhancing their overall experience.

### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?

Our experience with Push has been positive. While it’s early days since our integration, we anticipate significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction. The ability to send timely and relevant updates directly to users’ wallets is a powerful tool, and we expect to see increased interaction and responsiveness from our community as a result.

### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?

In the future, we plan to leverage Push’s chat feature to facilitate communication among investors in specific properties. This will enable token holders to discuss potential investments, share insights, and engage in general discussions related to real estate. By fostering a collaborative community, we believe this feature will add significant value to our platform and enhance the investment experience for our users.

Thanks, Parv for the awesome conversation. Looking forward to revolutionizing web3 communication together with Estate Protocol!
