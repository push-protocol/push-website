<i>This is our first week launching a brand new content series: Frens of Push. In this series, we highlight outstanding projects who are building using Push and give them the spotlight. If you’re interested in being featured, reach out to us!</i><br/><br/>

Earnifi, an airdrop aggregator platform designed to find unclaimed airdrops, has integrated Push to make airdrops more accessible to everyone!

Ever since the advent of DeFi, airdrops have become a popular marketing tool for protocols to incentivize early users. What started as a way to generate awareness about DeFi projects quickly resulted in providing momentum to the overall adoption of DeFi. The space, however, is now flooded with thousands of projects, leading to missed opportunities for claiming these airdrops. This is where Earnifi comes in.

By aggregating all available airdrops and bringing them to a single platform, Earnifi ensures you never miss out on an airdrop again.

In the first segment of “Frens of Push,” we sat down with Earnifi founder <a href="https://twitter.com/DawsonBotsford"><b>Dawson Botsford</b></a> to talk about how Push is furthering Earnifi’s “mission to find millions.”

## How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?
<b>Dawson:</b> I first got into Bitcoin back in 2014, trying to make arbitrage bots. I quickly learned that finance was not enough for me and that smart contracts were the long-term answer to decentralized finance. After working in web2 for the next 5 years, I returned to Ethereum and got obsessed with web 2.5 applications during DeFi Summer.

Nowadays I run Earnifi, The Airdrop Platform. Earnifi has notified over $1 billion USD since it began in February 2021. Since I’m an indie hacker, I run this alone without other employees.

In addition to my work as the CEO of Earnifi I also hack in TONS of [ETHGlobal](https://medium.com/u/3d1733b8e86a?source=post_page-----9ee5805730f9--------------------------------) hackathons, run the developer podcast [dev3.fm](https://reflect.fm/anchor/dev-3), and publish open-source projects. I am most proud of Essential Eth, a replacement for Ethers.js that is 20x smaller.

## How is Earnifi using Push’s web3 communication layer?
<b>Dawson:</b> Earnifi uses Push daily as a part of the notification engine. Some people want email notifications, but others want mobile notifications, which is where Push comes in. <b>Earnifi has pushed over 100,000 messages via Push!</b>

## How to use Earnifi?
<b>Dawson:</b> If you arrive at Earnifi you can easily paste in any Ethereum or Cosmos address. Earnifi will quickly search you for 2,000 different assets, all within just a few seconds. Many of these assets are worth hundreds of dollars and are airdropped to you because you’re an early adopter. Even Push had a big airdrop when they first launched!

## How would you describe your experience using Push Protocol? What benefits have you seen?
<b>Dawson:</b> Push has been a blast to work with because it enables decentralized notifications. With just a few lines of JavaScript, I’m sending out hundreds of thousands of notifications without ever needing to store information about users.

## What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?
Dawson: Push enables decentralized communication, so seeing the recent announcement of [Push Chat](https://app.push.org/#/chat) gets me super excited! Allowing more decentralized communication means that we can be better informed without needing to trust centralized parties.

## What haven’t we asked you about that you wish we had? How is Earnifi giving back?
<b>Dawson:</b> One thing Earnifi focuses heavily on is contributing to open-source code. You can see on <a href="https://earni.fi/oss">https://earni.fi/oss</a> that Earnifi supports not just revoke.cash but many other projects to bring safety and speed to web3. The world deserves a fast web3, which is why there are several open-source projects Earnifi supports and grows through both code contributions and grants.<br/><br/>

Once again, we thank Dawson for taking the time to speak with us! We look forward to growing alongside Earnifi and helping your protocol deliver meaningful value to the Web3 community.

Stay tuned for more exciting developments from both Push and Earnifi!
