We’ve come to the end of a Q2/2021 that for us as a team, makes us feel proud of everything accomplished and how much we’ve learned over this period.

Without further ado, let’s see what has been keeping us busy this month!

Roadmap Q2 Milestones ✅
=======================

Strategic Collabs! - Frens of EPNS keeps growing 💖
---------------------------------------------------

We worked diligently to deliver EPNS integrations with some of the most important protocols in the ecosystem.

*   **Uniswap**: To notify users when a new proposal is submitted.

*   **Alpha Homora**: To notify users about upcoming liquidation of leveraged positions, and taking them to their dashboard with 1 click.

We are ecstatic with the response received from the community as we end up Q2 with a list of 25+ protocols wanting to integrate EPNS into their offerings.

---------------------------

This extension allows users of blockchain platforms and wallets to get notified from the decentralized web.

We are making it easier to receive EPNS Push notifications while you browse the web.

The EPNS Browser Extension Alpha v1.0 has been submitted to the chrome store, and will be available soon.

This is just the start of a component that we plan to supercharge!

Great News for Devs! 👷🏽
-------------------------

This month we released two other tools for the development community:

*   **Showrunners Framework & Backend SDK Beta v1.0**: Together with this tool we also released sample apps and documentation aiming to help the developers get started with implementations. We covered this in detail in a [recent blog post](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework-and-backend-sdk-beta-v1-0-are-live-7348c0725a12). Make sure to check it out!
*   **Status update for protocol v1: This is where planning meets learning!  
    **We finished everything we had planned for the EPNS protocol as per our roadmap, and working on the Pilot Program Collaborations led us to make important improvements to our protocol to ensure we are ready to fulfill current and future needs.
