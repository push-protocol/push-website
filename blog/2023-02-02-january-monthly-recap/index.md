Welcome to our monthly update!

We are thrilled to share with you the numerous achievements and milestones we accomplished in the month of January ‚Äî spoiler, it's a lot.

From exciting new product developments to numerous giveaways, partnerships, and hackathons, January has been a whirlwind of activity for Push and the Push DAO.

With that, here‚Äôs a look at everything that kept us busy ü§©

## Product Updates

We‚Äôre kicking off the year with one of the most significant items on our roadmap - completion of the security audit and successful upgradation to [smart contracts v1.5](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1610706705439916032). This update breaks ground for the next phase of developments at Push and we are delighted to share all the [new functionalities](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-push-protocol-v1-5-80eb39b55424) as a result.

With the groundwork for Push Smart Contracts v2 in place, we‚Äôre already making strides in its development. Onwards and upwards! üöÄ

Besides the upgrade to v1.5, we‚Äôve also had a host of fantastic developments have taken place including:

- New features to the [Push Chat SDK](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat)
