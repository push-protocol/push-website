**2024 was a Push-tastic year for Push!**

Marked with super ambitious achievements, incredible growth and everlasting community support!

We crossed multiple milestones with Push Notifications Protocol and unveiled the next - most awaited phase of our evolution: [Push Chain - A shared state blockchain for shared app experiences](https://push.org/chain/).

Special thanks to all our Push Communications Protocol users for supporting our journey and making Push the de-facto communication layer for web3!

Let‚Äôs take a quick look at ‚ÄòPush Rewind 2024‚Äô
_Don't miss the final reel (We have a major alpha reveal!)_

import { ABlock } from "@site/src/css/SharedStyling";

## Push by Numbers

We finally achieved one of our most ambitious goals of sending over **100M** notifications to date!!

As of year-end - Push has sent over **138+ Million notifications to its 300k+ subscribers**.

That‚Äôs almost **3x** the number of notifications sent and double the number of [subscribers from last year](https://push.org/blog/push-roadmap-recap-2023/) üò±.

![subscribers gained in 2024](./image1.webp)

The Push ecosystem has expanded to **500 amazing projects**, including - [QuickSwap](https://app.push.org/channels/0xf198eBCc8dB86F707bAdDdBa236aB5b619c59D3c), [HyperLiquid](https://app.push.org/channels/0xf1A1542Ca902AE861B59bffE77D92E8CD76146f1),[Revoke](https://app.push.org/channels/0x65bB67c2416186aE3107F7c2C6728b272a579e3d), [ethOS](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1859145460939628803) and many more.

## Highlights

### 1. Push Points Program ‚ú®

![push points program](./image2.webp)

We kickstarted Phase 1 of [Push Points Program](https://app.push.org/points?utm_source=push_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Push+Points&utm_content=blog_post) - a gamified reputation system, aimed at giving back to our Push Fam, ecosystem communities and devs who have supported Push every step of the way and helped us reach greater heights.

Within three months of its launch, the program distributed millions of points to thousands of users for completing various activities centred around Push Communications Protocol, its ecosystem, and $PUSH staking.

## 9. Launched Wallet to Email / Telegram Notifications üìß

After tapping into over 300,000 wallets and sending over 100 million notifications we thought - **_how about sending on-chain notifications directly to your email or telegram?_**

This helps Push Communications to reach billions of everyday Email and TG users while paving the way for much smoother onboarding for web2 normies and budding web2 users.

Now, users can receive web3 notifications from over 500 DApps straight to their Telegram or email accounts - no need to connect a wallet or endure various friction points while entering the web3 space. Simply, connect your TG and Email and receive notifs.

It's that easy!

## 10. Push Metmamask Snap V2

In 2023, we bought Push Notifications to over 30 million Metamask users -by launching the [Push Metamask Snap](https://app.push.org/?/snap). In 2024, we upgraded the snap to **support chat and snooze notifications features** - to help users manage their notifications at their own pace and other forms of communication as well.

Due to Metamasks limitations for supporting communications across its mobile apps, we introduced in-app chat notifications on Push Mobile App [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/push-epns/id1528614910) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.epns.epns&hl=en)

## 12. Push DAO soaring to new heights üîù

Push DAO witnessed extraordinary exposure and participation in 2024.

With hundreds of new participants, over 50 regular contributors, global exposure, quality grantees, and tremendous support from the Push Fam community, we've made exceptional progress.

In June 2024, we launched Push DAO V2 to advance our journey toward progressive decentralization.
This new framework, supported by the DAO Council, streamlines engagement for contributors and builders.

The launch of our **Push Grants Program V3** empowered both, early-stage and established projects building innovative social, gaming, and mobile apps. This initiative has driven impressive results‚Äîincreasing grant applications tenfold and multiplying our active grantees five times over since the beginning of the year.

Our Push DAO BD SubDAO Program now offers rewards ranging from **$500‚Äì$1500** for successful integrations of Push Notifications/Chat with DAOs, DeFi protocols, dApps, and other projects. Through our council and contributors' dedicated efforts, this program has generated over 80 qualified leads for our ecosystem.

Our revamped ambassador programs have reached new heights of influence, establishing a student hub at **Texas Tech University** and forming connections with event organizers across more than four continents.

As we prepare to launch Push Chain, our DAO stands ready to make a significant impact on the ecosystem and beyond. Our core team brings together professionals with cross-industry expertise, while our current and prospective grantees span key industry sectors.
Having achieved extraordinary growth in less than a year, we're positioned for even greater achievements in 2025.

With our coordinated event and marketing strategy for the launch in place, you can expect to see the DAO everywhere next year, driving the chain's progress.

With hundreds of new contributors, global exposures, quality grantees and a lot of love from the Push Fam community!

To continue our journey of Push DAO towards progressive decentralisation we introduced a new DAO framework, [Push DAO V2](https://gov.push.org/t/push-dao-v2-push-dao-council/1631). This framework simplifies the process for contributors and builders to engage with the DAO, with the support of the DAO Council.

_And now - time for the special ALPHA!_

<!--  -->

## 13. GM Push Chain!üëã

After years of building one of the first consumer apps in web3, one key takeaway we learnt, was the pressing need for a consumer app-centric chain capable of unifying the entire web3 ecosystem under a shared state.

This realization inspired the creation of [Push Chain](https://push.org/chain/) - **a shared-state Layer 1 blockchain that unifies the settlement of all the incredible L1s, L2s, and L3s, enabling any user from any chain to access any app through one unified shared state.**

### Governance

The Push Chain proposal received an overwhelming response at the Push Gov Forum with over 92% acceptance.
The proposal then went on to SnapShot for formal voting - and we‚Äôre super stoked to announce that the community heavily participated in showing their voice and [passing the massive majority!](https://snapshot.box/#/s:pushdao.eth/proposal/0xa4a301c9a346356326d59e425245459d9fbde71b02aabc49a4ce191f0504f66a) Indicating a positive alignment with the team‚Äôs and the community‚Äôs vision.

### Push Chain WhitePaper

If you're curious about Push Chain's philosophical and technical foundations and want to take a detailed look, dive into the [Push Chain Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.push.org/).

The Whitepaper constitutes everything you need to know about Push Chain‚Äôs Vision, Mission and all the underlying technical innovations that solve the current hardships in Web3.

## 14. Launched Push Chain Devnet + Push Scan + Push Chain Website üåê

### Push Chain Devnet

We launched the **Push Chain Devnet**, offering an exciting sneak peek into transactions confirmed with sub-second finality - all while interacting with the chain in a **chain-and wallet-agnostic** manner. ü´£

### Push Scan

Also, say hello to [Push Scan](https://scan.push.org/home) üëã - A comprehensive explorer to view and analyze all transactions on the Push Chain.

### Push Website

Alongside, we unveiled the [Push Chain Website](https://push.org/chain/) - your go-to hub for all things Push Chain! Whether you‚Äôre looking for insights into its vision, key innovations, ecosystem, or developer tooling, the website acts as your gateway to the **Universe of Universal Apps.**

## 15. Push Nodes are here!

Push fam, we know you were extremely eager for Push Nodes, after its announcement early, this year.

Unlike most of the L1s, Push Chain too is a Proof Of Stake network - but with its own innovative flavour.

Push Chain splits the nodes into three types - Validator, Storage and Archival and enables a node governance smart contract that keeps track of all the nodes that are present in the network.

**Validator nodes** - Responsible for validating transactions;

**Storage nodes** - Dynamically shard data based on the hash of blockchain-agnostic addresses and store it; and

**Archival nodes** - Maintain a full snapshot of all transactions on the network.

Push Chain also introduced **Node Registry Smart Contracts** a key innovation that : - Registers nodes. - Manage dynamic sharding. - Set replication factors. - Enable parallel validators that scale dynamically with the number of nodes in the network and thus achieve **True Scale**!

## 15. Launched Push Wallet + Simulate Tx üëù

Push Chain incorporates **Wallet Abstraction to diminish the growing divide in operational level comfort experienced by Existing Web3 users and New users (Web2 normies) by creating a balanced ground for every web3 user persona.**

### Push Wallet

We were thrilled to introduce the [Push Wallet](https://wallet.push.org/)‚Äîa secure, user-friendly, and interoperable key management solution designed for the Push unified network.

Push Wallet offers: - A flexible and embeddable wallet experience tailored to individual user journeys. - Web2-style sign-ins. - Seamless connectivity, interaction, and transactions for wallets from any chain.

<ABlock href='https://wallet.push.org/' title="Push Governance Forum"> Try Push Wallet</ABlock>

### Simulate Transactions

To offer an early glimpse into transacting on Push Chain, we launched the Push Simulate Transactions App. This app showcases:

- Consumer (unordered) transactions on Push Devnet.
- Key innovations like PoS consensus, parallel validators, dynamic sharding, and wallet abstraction in action.
