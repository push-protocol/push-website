<p>We’re extremely excited to announce that Push Nodes are here! An all-new decentralized infrastructure for web3’s leading communication layer, the Push Protocol Network.</p>
<p>This new and improved decentralized infrastructure for Push is a long-awaited move that we’re only now executing thanks to extensive research and development.</p>
<p>So what does this new decentralized infrastructure look like?</p>
<p>In this article, we'll explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is decentralization in web3 and how will the new Push Network look</li>
<li>Exploring types of nodes and explanation of Push Nodes</li>
<li>Why is it necessary</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="understanding-different-types-of-decentralization---which-will-push-become">Understanding Different Types of Decentralization - Which Will Push Become<a href="https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes#understanding-different-types-of-decentralization---which-will-push-become" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding Different Types of Decentralization - Which Will Push Become" title="Direct link to Understanding Different Types of Decentralization - Which Will Push Become">​</a></h3>
<p>Decentralization can mean different things depending who you ask because it is a very complex topic that can exist in many different forms and structures. This is why many modern blockchains and protocols have tight discussions on what it means to be fully decentralized.</p>
<p>So to begin with, we’ll explore the different types of architecture at a high level as a way of best communicating what Push is working towards</p>
<p>Client-Server – Linear system <br>
Distributed – Different nodes hold different responsibilities and contribute to one another <br>
Peer-toPeer – Data is passed directly from user to user with no intermediaries<br>
Decentralized – Collective and shared control over data and decision making<br></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="First Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know" src="https://push.org/assets/images/image-1-cc99b36c89e8bfc06d5a59b599e5d50c.webp" width="1160" height="652" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As we’ve outlined in the image above, Push is moving towards the right. A fully decentralized network wherein no single node or entity has complete control of the network. Access is open and shared.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, decentralization can also be applied at different layers of an organization. Just as you can decentralize software architecture, you too can decentralize teams and organizational structures (DAOs).</p>
<p>While the Push Network already has a DAO and $PUSH token, we are now taking the final step towards decentralization by decentralizing our software architecture, completing what you might call ‘full stack decentralization’.</p>
<p>Our goal is to build a permissionless, trustless, proof-of-stake protocol with different node types that provide a decentralized API for notifications processing, indexing, and delivery. Ultimately, we’re aiming to wrap the whole system in a developer-friendly SDK package and a dApp that can leverage the power of this network.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="push-nodes-as-the-key-how-do-they-work">Push Nodes As The Key: How Do They Work<a href="https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes#push-nodes-as-the-key-how-do-they-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Push Nodes As The Key: How Do They Work" title="Direct link to Push Nodes As The Key: How Do They Work">​</a></h3>
<p>The Push Network will comprise three different types of Nodes. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validator nodes - Batching notifications into blocks, validating them, and providing all the required APIs for SDK</li>
<li>Storage nodes - Indexing notifications</li>
<li>Delivery nodes - Sending notifications to the end-user device based on his/her 0xwallet, not his/her hardware credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network is guarded by a smart contract to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the PUSH token is used.</p>
<p>In our proposed architecture, the storage network is sharded by a smart contract, which assigns specific shards to specific nodes to ensure a high amount of redundancy. This is done on top of storage nodes.</p>
<p>We’re targeting fast delivery of ~15s on average for delivery of Notifications.</p>
<p>Abstract architecture</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Second Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know" src="https://push.org/assets/images/image-2-f582d599b661dca47be6741aee109046.webp" width="1160" height="652" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The basic use-case:</p>
<p>A javascript SDK locates the right validator, posts a notification, and this notification will be included in the block. The block list of validator nodes for processing is determined by a combined network random number (randao).</p>
<p>A more detailed version of the architecture looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Third Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know" src="https://push.org/assets/images/image-3-284130ae22160c8ce52d0c9e8af25261.webp" width="1160" height="647" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We’ll now explore each of the three Node types in more detail.</p>

<p>Every validator can be slashed, in case his vote on the new block differs from the majority of their validators, which voted for the block as valid.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Fourth Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know" src="https://push.org/assets/images/image-4-60068ed2b000a58006e79291b702234f.webp" width="1157" height="647" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="storage-nodes">Storage nodes<a href="https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes#storage-nodes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Storage nodes" title="Direct link to Storage nodes">​</a></h4>
<p>Originally, Push Storage Nodes validate and index all communications and link them to a user’s wallet address and multi-chain identity.</p>
<p>The new Push decentralized system maps every wallet notification data to a specific shard.</p>
<p>This shard maintains X copies in the network. The smart contract dynamically computes x.
Whenever new nodes join, the contract recomputes which storage nodes are assigned to which shards.</p>

<p>Delivery nodes are a pivotal component of the decentralized Push Notification infrastructure. They ensure notifications are securely and efficiently delivered to the end-user’s device while serving as a decentralized solution for connecting web3 and web2. These nodes can be hosted by trusted third parties, bringing reliability and professionalism to the system. Their operation hinges on a few key principles and functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Integration with Established APIs</b>: To leverage robust, widely-accepted infrastructure for sending Push Notifications.</li>
<li><b>Privacy-Centric Mapping</b>: To maintain the privacy and security of the users, delivery nodes store a mapping between a registered crypto wallet and the end-user device ID.</li>
<li><b>Hosting by Trusted Entities</b>: Recognizing the importance of reliability and trust in the notification delivery process, delivery nodes can be hosted by trusted third parties.</li>
<li><b>Collaboration with Wallet Providers</b>: In addition to being hosted by trusted third parties, delivery nodes can also be hosted by wallet providers themselves. This collaboration brings an added layer of integration and convenience, as wallet providers have a direct interest in ensuring that their users receive notifications promptly and securely.</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe that communication tools should be a public good. Builders should have open and free access to enhance their dApps with web3-native communication, without needing to rely on centralized providers.</p>
<p>As an extension of this, those same builders should not just have access to these tools, but a say in how these tools get developed and improved over time.</p>
<p>As the accessibility of these tools grows, so does the quality of dApps that build with them. When we achieve the goal of building better projects, we move closer towards a reality where we can onboard the next billion users to web3.</p>
<p>We are excited for this new era for the Push Protocol Network and we are extremely excited to have you be a part of it.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Push Chat message benchmark 💬 ⚡" src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-dcdb2b80c6fc316614203ff627f1a1a9.webp" width="1600" height="840" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Push Chat has revolutionized web3 messaging, providing a seamless experience for user-to-user, user-to-dApp, and group conversations. Essentially, Push Chat bridges the gap between messaging in web3 and web2, offering a hassle-free transition. One pivotal enhancement we've diligently pursued within Push Chat involves reconfiguring the architecture for storing and retrieving messages, resulting in significantly faster performance.</p>
<p>Whether you're engaging in public group chats, participating in private discussions, or accessing token-gated communities, Push Group Chat simplifies and secures connections. Now, Push is elevating its scalability and drastically improving message transmission speeds.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="understanding-push-chat-message-architecture">Understanding Push Chat Message Architecture<a href="https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message#understanding-push-chat-message-architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding Push Chat Message Architecture" title="Direct link to Understanding Push Chat Message Architecture">​</a></h3>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="v1-architecture">V1 Architecture<a href="https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message#v1-architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to V1 Architecture" title="Direct link to V1 Architecture">​</a></h4>
<p>In the earlier iteration of Push Chat, messages were managed within a linked list structure. This architecture employed references where each message pointed to the previous one, creating a sequential chain of messages. However, this design encountered some significant hurdles.</p>
<p>One notable issue arose from the concurrent arrival of messages, as the linked list format struggled to handle the concurrent processing of incoming messages. This concurrency bottleneck often resulted in performance degradation and dropping of messages by Push nodes, undermining the real-time nature of Push Chat.</p>
<p>Moreover, the process of retrieving messages from this linked list structure posed its own set of challenges. Since Push nodes primarily stored references to the latest message, retrieving older messages required traversing the entire linked list sequentially. This approach led to slow query speeds, as resolving previous messages necessitated the resolution of the current message first.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="v2-architecture">V2 Architecture<a href="https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message#v2-architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to V2 Architecture" title="Direct link to V2 Architecture">​</a></h4>
<p>In the latest iteration, Push Chat has undergone a significant architectural transformation, one of the most notable changes in v2 is the abandonment of the linked list paradigm, where each message no longer references the previous one.</p>
<p>By eliminating the requirement for messages to reference the previous one, v2 architecture significantly simplifies message processing, enabling Push nodes to handle concurrent messages more efficiently. This architectural shift has alleviated the concurrency bottleneck that plagued the earlier version, enhancing the scalability and responsiveness of Push Chat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in v2, Push nodes now cache every message instead of solely storing references to the latest message hash. This strategic enhancement plays a pivotal role in optimizing message retrieval speeds. By caching every message, Push nodes can swiftly access and deliver messages upon request, mitigating the latency issues associated with sequential message resolution.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that despite these architectural changes, the fundamental immutable layer of Push Chat remains rooted in IPFS. Every message, whether in v1 or v2, continues to be backed up by a client-signed and verifiable verification proof. This cryptographic mechanism ensures the integrity and authenticity of messages, safeguarding them against tampering or unauthorized alterations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note:: It's important to acknowledge that the benchmarking of v2 architecture was conducted on a development server, while the benchmarking of v1 architecture took place on a production server. It's worth highlighting that the production server possesses 16 times more CPU power than the development server, potentially providing an unfair advantage to v1 architecture. Additionally, it's crucial to recognize that the traffic volume on the production server is substantially higher compared to the development environment. These discrepancies in server specifications and traffic levels should be considered when interpreting the benchmark results.</p>

<p>Push Notifications are sent between addresses via the Push Nodes. Push Nodes are the nodes responsible for validating notification and chat payload and for dispatching notifications to addresses. Push Nodes can have different roles in this Communication Network.
The vision for Push Protocol is for the Push Nodes to be run by the community and to get rewarded by contributing to the network's decentralization. As of today, Push Nodes are run by Push Protocol, but the team is working on decentralizing the nodes.
Although the Push Nodes are run by Push Protocol, users can always verify that the chat messages and notifications haven’t been tampered with and that they have indeed been sent by the correct address. Users can always verify this by the Verification Proof.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Announcing “Group Chat” from Push Protocol and Unstoppable Domains " src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-795636df73199722574cdcb0931a4bf7.gif" width="800" height="450" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Today, we're thrilled to announce an exciting new chapter in our partnership with Unstoppable Domains (UD): the launch of 'Group Chat' on the UD messaging platform! 🎉</p>
<p>Last year, UD and Push Protocol announced <a href="https://medium.com/push-protocol/business-to-user-messaging-push-protocol-x-unstoppable-domains-6bef7e262f7d#:~:text=Push%20Protocol%20is%20partnering%20with,and%20partners%20natively%20on%20web3." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business-to-user messaging</a> on the UD messaging platform — the result of a longstanding product relationship between the two companies that began <a href="https://push.org/blog/epns-partners-with-unstoppable-domains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2021</a>. Today, the launch of the token-gated Group Chat on the UD messaging platform is another step towards decentralized, open, censorship-resistant communication for the future of the web. At launch, UD Group messaging will go live with <b>400+ Groups, for 3.8M+ UD users</b>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="group-chat-a-shift-in-decentralized-communication">Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication<a href="https://push.org/blog/announcing-group-chat-from-push-unstoppable#group-chat-a-shift-in-decentralized-communication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication" title="Direct link to Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication">​</a></h3>
<p>Currently, UD’s messaging interface <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/categories/announcements/article/messaging-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unstoppable Messaging</a> allows any web3 user to message addresses belonging to a .eth, .x, .crypto domain, .polygon along with many other domains. However, Unstoppable Messaging has been limited to just one-to-one and one-to-many messaging. As such, we’ve been working with Unstoppable Domains to enable a robust, token-gated system through badges, allowing anyone with a <a href="https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001215751-badges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">badge</a> to join a Group Chat and start a conversation.</p>
<p>By blending UD’s expertise in web3 domain services with Push Protocol’s market-leading decentralized messaging technology, we’re excited to release this all-new feature to the web3 community.</p>
<blockquote><i><p>“Our partnership with Unstoppable is not merely about changing the way teams communicate; it's about revolutionizing it. 'Group Chat' embodies our dedication to empowering organizations with cutting-edge communication technology."</p></i><b>— Harsh Rajat, Founder at Push Protocol</b></blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-are-token-gated-group-chats">What Are Token Gated Group Chats<a href="https://push.org/blog/announcing-group-chat-from-push-unstoppable#what-are-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Are Token Gated Group Chats" title="Direct link to What Are Token Gated Group Chats">​</a></h3>
<p>Token-gated Group Chats are exactly what their name implies, Group Chats that require you to hold a specific token (NFT or crypto-asset) to either access any given group, or message within it. Token-gating your Group Chats is a surefire way of controlling who can enter your chats and who can message within them. As the admin of your Group Chat, you can set and adjust permissions whenever you like.</p>
<p>For businesses, organizations, and teams, it’s a fantastic way to ensure your communication channels remain private and secure by giving you total control over who enters and participates in the communication channel.</p>

<p>In August last year, we started an exciting journey with the <a href="https://push.org/blog/a-billion-reasons-to-build-finding-india-s-best-web3-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch</a> of our Billion Reasons to Build (BRB) developer tour across India. The mission of the campaign was simple – to provide developers the opportunity to create real-world impact by giving them a hard problem to solve from leading protocols. This of course included rewards.</p>
<p>To create a variety of challenges, we teamed up with 12 of the most prominent protocols in web3 including Ethereum Foundation, ETHGlobal, Polygon, Filecoin, The Graph, Aragon, Timeswap, Alchemy, Shardeum, Flipkart, Biconomy, and Chainsafe to create a running hackathon.</p>
<p>Each partner in the BRB hackathon presented their own unique Coding Challenge – a complex problem with a substantial bounty for the builder who could solve it.</p>
<p>Today, we're thrilled to announce that 2 of these Coding Challenges have been solved!</p>
<p>Here are the 2 challenges, the importance behind each of them, and the masterminds behind the game-changing solutions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="quantum-proofing-ethereum-network--solved-by-aditya-bisht">Quantum-proofing Ethereum Network – solved by Aditya Bisht<a href="https://push.org/blog/announcing-winners-of-billion-reasons#quantum-proofing-ethereum-network--solved-by-aditya-bisht" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Quantum-proofing Ethereum Network – solved by Aditya Bisht" title="Direct link to Quantum-proofing Ethereum Network – solved by Aditya Bisht">​</a></h3>

<p>Challenge: Figure out a way to quantum-proof the Ethereum Network, read more <a href="https://www.notion.so/pushprotocol/Ethereum-Foundation-07179dcf7f7e44efb7d2b2c9d2296264?pvs=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<p>Winning Builder: <a href="https://twitter.com/bisht__13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aditya Bisht</a></p>
<p>Quantum computing is a looming threat to blockchain networks. Its powerful computing capabilities mean it can be used to reverse-engineer secret keys from public keys. To retain security and integrity in the Ethereum Network, the challenge was presented to find a way to quantum-proof the network using account abstraction.</p>
<p>We’d like to congratulate <b>Aditya Bisht</b> for successfully solving the challenge and contributing to the security and robustness of the Ethereum Network.</p>
<p>He shared his excitement with us – “Faced with intriguing complexities and the convergence of overlapping domains, the challenge not only pushed the boundaries but also contributed to advancing the ZK domain. Immense gratitude to the mentors from the Ethereum foundation and the unwavering support from Push. This victory is a testament to the collaborative spirit propelling the Ethereum project forward.” – Aditya</p>

<p>Coding Challenge Owner: <a href="https://aragon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a></p>
<p>Challenge: Create a permission management protocol for allocating selective permissions to specific individuals and subDAOs, read more <a href="https://www.notion.so/pushprotocol/Aragon-f5467edc3c2a4f8d9d5693a0a6e680de?pvs=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Winning Builder: <a href="http://plopmenz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samuel Mens</a></p>
<p>DAOs and organizations rely on being able to give certain permissions, roles, and responsibilities to specific individuals and teams (subDAOs) in order to build more efficiently. But keeping track of which wallets have which permissions can be confusing, not to mention how easy it is to lose track of these permissions across a single DAO. As such, the problem statement required a builder to find a way that enables a DAO to efficiently manage permissions.</p>
<p>With that, we’d like to congratulate Samuel Mens who built two plugins and a UI that allow you to manage both subDAOs and NFT-based permissions using <a href="https://twitter.com/hatsprotocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@hatsprotocol</a> and Aragon OSx. For all DAOs that are built using Aragon, there is now a whole new level of on-chain governance management tools available.</p>
<blockquote><i><p>"I've been part of the Aragon community since their launch of OSx and have built several plugins. I had this idea for a pretty ambitious plugin, which alligned very well with the BRB Hackathon bounty. I am very grateful for Push Protocol for providing this opportunity, giving me the motivation to actually built it and go the extra mile."</p></i><div><p>– Samuel Mens</p></div></blockquote>

<p>We had an exciting year at Push! It's time to recap what we achieved, impact it made and where we are headed next!</p>
<p>2023 was amazing for Push as we launched the products and features we've been working on to provide a full web3 communication stack for developers, businesses and users. Let's dive into the details of what all we achieved in 2023.</p>

<p>Push has grown tremendously in 2023, we saw an increase in notifications sent (+50 Million YTD) and subscribers (154k). Our ecosystem expanded as more protocols started using Push to send notifications / chat to their users across chains. Push is now live on 5 chains including Ethereum, Polygon zKEVM, PoS, Arbitrum and BNB.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Notification data for Push Protocol growth" src="https://push.org/assets/images/subscribers2023-74aa2b76587930e6025526f4701bc22a.png" width="1600" height="840" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Push launched a unified SDK for web3 developers to send <a title="Explore Push Notifications Protocol" href="https://push.org/docs/notifications/"><strong>notifications</strong></a> or <a title="Explore Push Chat Protocol" href="https://push.org/docs/chat/"><strong>chats</strong></a> to their users with unification of the SDK, with <strong>video</strong> and <strong>spaces</strong> support coming soon!</p>
<p>This enabled Push API class that is common for all suite of products by Push enabling developers to use Push products with ease. It also paved the way for Push to heavily abstract away the complexities of web3 communication and provide a seamless experience to developers.</p>

<p>Push started with the vision of enabling seamless communication for web3, launching Snaps for 30 Million users of MetaMask was a big step towards that vision as it allows users to have their communication delivered to them right on their MetaMask wallet.</p>
<p>We are excited to share that web3 notifications sent by protocols using Push are now delivered to users on MetaMask. If you are a web3 builder, then re-engagement is a big problem for you which get's solved by implementing <a title="Explore Push Docs" href="https://push.org/docs/">web3 notifications with Push now!</a></p>

<p>Our partner <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Push x Unstoppable">Unstoppable Domains</a> launched notifications and group chats for their 3.8 Million users using Push making Push Unstoppable :). Their mobile app also uses Push to send notifications to their users.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Preview of how Push is getting used by Unstoppable" src="https://push.org/assets/images/poweredbypush2-d2ed6cc49cbf59f98bc8faa72c85175b.png" width="2826" height="1708" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>What's more, UD have open sourced their code for the community to use and contribute to.

<p>Push launched gated chats for web3 protocols to enable them to create gated communities for their users. This enables protocols / DAOs / NFTs to create a community of their users and engage with them based on the gamification of their choice.</p>
<p>For example: You can gate a group chat for users who hold a certain NFT or have a certain amount of tokens in their wallet or you can gate sending messages in a group chat based on the amount of tokens a user holds. Even custom logic of your choice or web2 logic can be used to gate a group chat paving new token utility use cases for your protocol.</p>

<p>Push launched hyper-scalable groups allowing upto 5k users for private and 25k users for public groups. This enables protocols to create large communities of their users and engage with them in a seamless manner. This is a big deal! Web2 chat apps like Whatsapp or Signal are only able to support upto 1k users!</p>
<p>For the first time, Web3 messaging is coming at par with and beating most Web2 messaging apps in terms of scalability but with the added benefit of being immutable, permissionless and containing web3 native functionalities.</p>

<p>Notifications for web3 are synonymous with Push. Our partners wanted to have a way to enable their users to control their notification settings on what they exactly wanted. Notifications settings is the answer to that, allowing users to control their notification settings on a granular level.</p>

<p>Push Spaces enable several users to have audio call like experience with each other, all from the comfort of your web3 wallet! It borrows scalability and gated functionality from Push Chat protol enabling new and creative ways by which all of Web3 can interact with each other.</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:360px"></div>
<a href="https://push.org/blog/push-spaces-is-live-decentralized-audio-and-video-streaming-is-here/" title="Introduction to Push Spaces" class="SharedStyling__ABlock-sc-1enui31-20 klXhSd">Learn more about Push Spaces!</a>

<p>Push vision is to become the de-facto communication stack for web3. Real time communication like Video and Spaces was something we always planned as the next primitive to build on top of Push, as per the <a href="https://whitepaper.push.org/protocol-specs-section/future-features-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Whitepaper talking about Push Video">whitepaper 1.0</a>.</p>
<p>The team delivered on this promise as well but with some added benefites! Since it's built on top of the composable standard of Push Chat and Notification protocol, it benefits from their architecture, utilizing notifications for having a facetime call like interface and group chat for enabling gated calls.</p>

<p>Push Protocol V2 introduced the ability to do incentivized chat along with establishing the fee pool for Push Protocol. Fee pool is a mechanism by which Push Protocol ensures that all players in the ecosystem are incentivized to grow the ecosystem and are rewarded for their efforts.</p>
<p>Yield farming V2 is also enabled by Push Protocol V2, allowing users to earn rewards + fees earned by the network. V2 enables this fee pool to be split among all <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><em><strong><code>$PUSH</code></strong></em></a> based on the amount of token staked and the duration from which they have held onto the tokens.</p>

<p>Push also launched NFT Chat, enabling for the first time to have chat and other forms of communication tied to NFTs. This unlocks a whole new world of possibilities for NFTs where Web3 Socials or any NFT can have communication tied to it which seamlessly can be moved from one wallet to another.</p>

<p>Push Chat has been a game-changer for  web3 messaging, offering a hassle-free experience for user to user, user to dApp, and group conversations. In essence, Push Chat makes messaging in web3 as seamless as it is in web2. One feature we’ve been working on extensively within Push Chat is Push Group Chat, the ability to host conversations with multiple members.</p>
<p>Whether you're chatting in public groups, enjoying more private discussions, or joining token-gated communities, Push Group Chat makes connecting with others simple and secure. But now, Push is levelling up its scalability and increasing group limits into the thousands. Let's dive into the enhanced possibilities and expanded horizons that await this enhanced Push Group Chat!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="from-15k-to-25k-members-in-a-single-group-chat-">From 1.5k to 25k Members in a Single Group Chat! 🔥<a href="https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#from-15k-to-25k-members-in-a-single-group-chat-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From 1.5k to 25k Members in a Single Group Chat! 🔥" title="Direct link to From 1.5k to 25k Members in a Single Group Chat! 🔥">​</a></h3>
<p>Group Chat platforms have always struggled with the number of participants a single group could accommodate. This limitation has hindered the potential for large-scale user interactions and hence restricted how Group Chats can be used to connect with a broader audience. Introducing our newly enhanced Push Group Chat. We’re calling it "hyper scalable" in reference to Push Group Chat’s newfound ability to handle significantly larger group sizes, transcending its prior  limitations. This enhancement signifies a major development for web3-native user interactions , empowering users to engage in more extensive and inclusive group conversations like never before.</p>
<p>With hyper scalability, Push Group Chat has transformed the landscape of group conversations. Public group limits have skyrocketed from 1500 to an impressive 25,000 members. Similarly, private groups once capped at 50 members, now support up to 5,000 participants. These substantial increases are redefining the potential for group interactions in web3 and  reflect Push Group Chat's commitment to delivering a more dynamic and accommodating messaging experience.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="push-chat-challenging-web2-incumbents">Push Chat Challenging Web2 Incumbents<a href="https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#push-chat-challenging-web2-incumbents" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Push Chat Challenging Web2 Incumbents" title="Direct link to Push Chat Challenging Web2 Incumbents">​</a></h3>
<p>Instant communication has long been dominated by traditional Web2 chat applications like WhatsApp and Signal, but Push Chat is here to challenge that. While the incumbents rely on centralised architectures that leave user data susceptible to potential vulnerabilities, Push Chat pioneers a decentralised approach, ensuring end-to-end encryption and placing control back into the hands of users.</p>
<p>Moreover, the introduction of hyper scalability in Push Chat takes the competitive edge to new heights. In contrast to the confined group sizes enforced by WhatsApp and Signal, where limitations are approximately 1000 members, Push Chat shatters these constraints by accommodating a staggering 25k members for public groups and 5k for private groups.</p>

<p>In the relentless pursuit of hyper scalability, Push Chat has had to undergo transformational advancements at both the architectural and encryption levels.</p>
<p>Previously, each message within private groups underwent encryption using the private keys of all group members, resulting in encryption complexity directly proportional to the number of participants.</p>
<p>Contrastingly, the platform has been upgraded to now dynamically generate session keys and encrypted secrets during every pivotal group state change, such as adding, removing, or joining members. Push Chat ensures that the time-consuming aspect of the encryption process is reserved for moments when the group dynamic undergoes significant transformations. This innovative approach ensures that the encryption process for private group messages remains constant, irrespective of the group's size. By dissociating encryption complexity from the number of participants, Push Chat has effectively eliminated the scalability concerns associated with larger private groups.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="but-waitmore-enhancements-are-on-the-way">But Wait…More Enhancements Are On The Way!<a href="https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#but-waitmore-enhancements-are-on-the-way" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to But Wait…More Enhancements Are On The Way!" title="Direct link to But Wait…More Enhancements Are On The Way!">​</a></h3>
<p>We are not stopping at 5k members. We have already made the breakthrough to take this to <b>100,000</b> benchmarked members 😱 for both private and public group chats. The only caveat is that it breaks backward compatibility when messages using the newer architecture are read by older SDKs.</p>
<p>To address this, we have decided to implement these changes in two phases:
Incorporate all functionalities that understand the new architecture in Push SDK from 1.4.45 upwards. Devs just need to update to start supporting the reading of those formats.
The use of the feature flags in the SDK (See below or ask on Discord as to how to enable that: <a href="https://discord.gg/pushprotocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://discord.gg/pushprotocol</a>) enables the new standard as the default allowing devs to tap into it and use that in case they want.</p>
<p>So, what do you have to do to update this functionality?</p>
<p>Only one thing: Update the SDK to the latest version (1.4.45 or upwards), that’s it! This will ensure that messages sent using the new message standards are understood and displayed correctly in your dApp / mobile app / etc.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-to-enable-push-sdk-feature-flag">How to enable Push SDK Feature Flag<a href="https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#how-to-enable-push-sdk-feature-flag" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to enable Push SDK Feature Flag" title="Direct link to How to enable Push SDK Feature Flag">​</a></h4>
<p>In-depth details for how to enable this can be found in the <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chat documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-sdk/tree/main/packages/restapi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="push-sdk-v2-is-coming">Push SDK V2 is Coming<a href="https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#push-sdk-v2-is-coming" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Push SDK V2 is Coming" title="Direct link to Push SDK V2 is Coming">​</a></h3>
<p>We are also thrilled to announce that we are working on the V2 version of the SDK which will ensure a standardized Push user class that enables unified access to notifications, chat, video, spaces, and more!</p>
<p>Apart from this, the V2 version will have more streamlined response objects and faster calls though it will break backward compatibility which is why we will transition slowly to the new SDK.</p>
<p>We recommend joining our Discord server (<a href="https://discord.gg/pushprotocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://discord.gg/pushprotocol</a>) -&gt; #dev-announcements channel for information on how to upgrade / best practices / changelog.</p>]]></content>
