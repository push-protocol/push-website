<p>To all the builders and 1.6M active wallets on <a href="https://arbitrum.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arbitrum</a>, get ready – because we've arrived!</p>
<p>Bringing with us our full suite of web3-native communication tools: <a href="https://push.org/docs/notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Notifications</a>, <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chat</a>, <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/build/create-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom Gated Group Chat</a> to enhance the user experience on Arbitrum.</p>
<p>We're absolutely thrilled to be leading a new era of decentralized communication within one of the fastest-growing blockchains in web3 and can’t wait to see the all-new usability, multi-communication interoperability, and dApp user-experience enhancements that are already on the way. Leveraging the power of Arbitrum's scalable, fast, and secure Layer 2 solutions, Push notifications enable real-time alerts for various blockchain activities such as transaction confirmations, governance proposals, DeFi updates, and NFT drops.</p>
<p>So what else is there to know and get excited about? Let’s dive in.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="arbitrum-x-push-protocol---revolutionizing-decentralized-interaction">Arbitrum x Push Protocol - Revolutionizing Decentralized Interaction<a href="https://push.org/blog/push-protocol-on-arbitrum-blockchain#arbitrum-x-push-protocol---revolutionizing-decentralized-interaction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Arbitrum x Push Protocol - Revolutionizing Decentralized Interaction" title="Direct link to Arbitrum x Push Protocol - Revolutionizing Decentralized Interaction">​</a></h3>
<p>Since our mainnet launch in January 2022, Push has emerged as the go-to communication layer for over 700+ of the world's leading dApps on <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://polygon.technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BNB Chain</a>, <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon zkEVM</a>, <a href="https://linea.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linea</a> and other blockchains.</p>
<p>Now, we’re expanding our privacy-centric communication product suite to the leading Layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum, Arbitrum. With over <a href="https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/ethereum-l2-arbitrum-base/#:~:text=It%20boasts%20a%20market%20share,a%20TVL%20of%20%247.93b." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">45.1% of the Ethereum Layer-2</a> market share and a TVL of over $15.42 Billion – Arbitrum provides some of the best tools for building scalable dApps on Ethereum and has an incredibly active user-base (with 971M in total DeFi transactions across 1.6M active wallets as of June 2024).</p>
<p>As such, what makes this integration so exciting is the potential utility and enhancement possibilities. Leveraging Push Notifications, Chat, and Video, we look forward to integrating with leading Arbitrum dApps to enhance how dApps and users interact.</p>
<p>The best part of our integration: multi-chain communication. As we continue to expand our blockchain integrations, we open the door to better interoperability between users on different chains. This enhanced user-experience means fewer compromises in the way of interaction and engagement for users, and as a result, better adoption and user-stickiness. All this utility is driven by the communication infrastructure of Push Protocol.</p>

<p>We're back with Frens of Push, offering a deep dive into the top protocols and Push ecosystem partners. This week, Estate Protocol is joining us, the leading tokenized real estate marketplace on the Arbitrum blockchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.estateprotocol.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estate Protocol</a> is bridging the gap between the tangible world of real estate and the boundless possibilities of the digital world by tokenizing real-world real estate, transforming properties into fractionalized digital assets through blockchain technology, ensuring security, transparency, and efficiency.</p>
<p>By way of this collaboration, Push assists Estate Protocol in notifying users directly on their wallets. Users can subscribe to receive notifications about new property listings, rent collection updates, and other important news. This integration ensures that users are always informed about the latest developments and opportunities within the platform, enhancing their overall experience.</p>
<p>In this episode of “Frens of Push”, Parv Prabhakar, CEO of Estate Protocol, joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push Protocol and Estate Protocol can potentially disrupt real estate investing.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="hi-parv-whats-your-story-how-did-you-become-involved-in-building-in-the-blockchain-space-what-are-you-working-on-now">Hi Parv, what’s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?<a href="https://push.org/blog/estate-protocol-joins-frens-of-push#hi-parv-whats-your-story-how-did-you-become-involved-in-building-in-the-blockchain-space-what-are-you-working-on-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hi Parv, what’s your story?

How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?">​</a></h3>
<p>I have a research and crypto background.  I’ve been using digital currency in some form since I was 12 years old and was playing zynga poker on facebook selling chips for real money.</p>
<p>I got into crypto shortly after, buying my first bitcoin on local bitcoins. I then got deeper and deeper into the tech and the finance side of it, developing arbitrage strategies. Did that across platforms and payment methods for a couple of years, and then started traveling the world and discovered cross-country strategies. Did a 300x during the 2021 bull run with delta neutral bets.</p>
<p>I was also into writing at this time, and this Dutch art collective asked me to write an essay going into NFTs in detail about 3 years ago, during the research for it it hit me that this technology is perfect for digitizing ownership in real estate. So I started researching about how to make it happen alongside my job as a guest writer for India’s biggest crypto exchange WazirX, wrote the white paper for Estate Protocol, got some peers to review and advice, and then quit the job to build this full time. The business evolved way past using NFTs too.</p>
<p>The time with Estate Protocol since then has been incredible. We tokenized the first properties in Dubai, and are working on many new innovations in the space.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="tell-us-about-estate-protocol--whats-it-about-and-what-problem-does-it-solve">Tell us about Estate Protocol — what’s it about and what problem does it solve?<a href="https://push.org/blog/estate-protocol-joins-frens-of-push#tell-us-about-estate-protocol--whats-it-about-and-what-problem-does-it-solve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tell us about Estate Protocol — what’s it about and what problem does it solve?" title="Direct link to Tell us about Estate Protocol — what’s it about and what problem does it solve?">​</a></h3>
<p>Estate Protocol is changing the global real estate market by leveraging blockchain and UK trust law to tokenize assets, and stablecoins to facilitate seamless cross-border transactions. We tokenize the world’s most in demand real estate, fractionalize the ownership, and make it a part of DeFi in a compliant manner. We would soon enable lending/borrowing, and bring large REITs on the platform.</p>

<p>We are working on bringing the world’s best real estate on chain. As crypto natives, we would also be making it compatible with DeFi as far as possible. There are also some exciting partnerships currently being worked on!</p>

The ability to send timely and relevant updates directly to users’ wallets is a powerful tool, and we expect to see increased interaction and responsiveness from our community as a result.</p>

<p>In the future, we plan to leverage Push’s chat feature to facilitate communication among investors in specific properties. This will enable token holders to discuss potential investments, share insights, and engage in general discussions related to real estate. By fostering a collaborative community, we believe this feature will add significant value to our platform and enhance the investment experience for our users.</p>
<p>Thanks, Parv for the awesome conversation. Looking forward to revolutionizing web3 communication together with Estate Protocol!</p>

<p><a href="https://ens.domains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ENS (Ethereum Name Service)</a> is a decentralized domain naming system built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It works similarly to the Domain Name System (DNS) we use for traditional websites on the internet, but instead of translating domain names (like <a href="https://app.push.org/channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://app.push.org/channels</a>) to IP addresses, ENS translates human-readable names (like alice.eth) into respective Ethereum addresses.</p>

<p>On subscribing to the ENS channel with the address that has your actively registered ENS domain, the ENS channel monitors your ENS domain’s expiry dates and starts sending push notifications up to 7 days in advance, before your domain expires.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image for April Month Protocol updates for year 2024" src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-73ee01077d5f1540f53f716312e0a341.webp" width="1600" height="840" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>April was a month of significant progress for the <a href="https://push.org/frens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Ecosystem</a>. We reached new milestones and launched exciting initiatives. We sent out more than <strong>6 Million</strong> notifications in April reaching a cumulative <strong>74 Million notifications</strong> since the launch and 177K subscribers. The Push journey continues to gain momentum. Here’s a recap of what happened:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="product-updates">Product Updates:<a href="https://push.org/blog/april-recap-blog-2024#product-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Product Updates:" title="Direct link to Product Updates:">​</a></h2>
<p>We've made significant strides in our development journey. We successfully deployed our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/react-native-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native SDK</a> on NPM, simplifying the process for developers to access it. We've also rolled out improved notification settings on app stores, allowing for a more customized user experience.</p>
<p>In our SDK, we introduced a new <strong>ChatWidget</strong> component and broadened our blockchain support to include <strong>Berachain</strong> and <strong>Polygon Amoy</strong>.</p>
<p>Our website has been enhanced with a fresh landing page for the <a href="https://push.org/bootcamp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Billion Reasons to Build (BRB) Bootcamp</a>, and we've enhanced the footer for smoother navigation.</p>
<p>We're steadily advancing with new blockchain integrations that are currently under review. We've streamlined our channel addition process by separating it from IPFS, among other improvements. We're in the process of developing support for SCW wallets on our Push SDK.</p>
<p>Our research on the Cross Chain Feature, which enables Ethereum and Layer 2 requests, has been completed and its development is underway. The <strong>Push Governance</strong> contract has been redesigned to align with the updated OpenZeppelin governance structure. We've managed to reduce the Smart Contract size by 30% and optimize gas fees for key functions like channel creation.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roseon - Leading AI-Powered Exchange Joins Frens Of Push]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Roseon - Leading AI-Powered Exchange Joins Frens Of Push  " src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-f43e64038e2aa7af918d0786b0b08ae5.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Welcome back to "Frens of Push”- a deep dive into the top protocols and Push ecosystem partners. This week, we're joined by Roseon, a leading AI-powered cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>Roseon is the ultimate crypto ecosystem prioritizing user experience and gamification. It includes RoseonX, an AI-driven exchange with a modular architecture, and DeFi SuperApp, a one-stop mobile crypto app. With over 330K+ users and a global reach of 750K, it aims to boost crypto adoption and optimize investments.</p>
<p>By way of this collaboration, Push helps Roseon keep its users in the loop by sending important updates like order executions &amp; liquidation directly to their wallets, <a href="http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RoseonX Notification Channel</a>. Roseon is also working on adding Push notifications to RoseonX, so users can get updates right on the platform.</p>
<p>In this episode of “Frens of Push”, Elle - Marketing Executive at Roseon joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push and Roseon has the potential to change the way we communicate in web3.</p>
<p><strong>1. Hi Elle, what’s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone, this is Elle, and I work as Marketing Exec at Roseon. My fascination with blockchain and cryptography sparked in 2021, and it truly felt like stepping into a whole new world. Fast forward to today, and I’m thrilled to be part of the incredible team at Roseon. Who would've thought that my curiosity would lead me here? Life works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?</p>
<p><strong>2. Tell us about Roseon Exchange — what’s it about and what problem does Roseon solve?</strong></p>
<p>RoseonX is an AI-powered exchange with Modular Architecture. So, to give you the full story, it all started with the goal of bridging the gap between CeFi and DeFi, making crypto easily accessible. Our first mobile crypto app, RoseonApp, boasts over 300,000 registered users, with a peak of 20,000 daily active users. We were proud to be ranked among the Top 9 stars in BNB Chain Web3 Stars Accelerator Vietnam.</p>
<p>Fueled by our visionary spirit, we made a strategic decision to pivot and delve into the development of our second product, RoseonX - initially a Gamified Derivatives DEX. Our approach embraces gamification, injecting a fresh level of engagement, fun, and excitement into crypto earning, trading, and DeFi in general. More recently, our whitepaper has evolved with the integration of AI, Copy Trading, and the Strategy Vault, transforming RoseonX into an AI Powered Exchange with Modular Architecture. This leap is geared towards enhancing the overall user experience in trading and other DeFi activities. Coupled with a friendly UI/UX, our aim is to drive mass adoption of our platform.</p>
<p>We're thrilled about the direction RoseonX is taking, and we're excited to bring this innovative approach to the world of crypto and DeFi.</p>
<p><strong>3. What’s the 2024 plan for Roseon Exchange and its ecosystem?</strong></p>
<p>Our primary aim is to bring our new roadmap to life, complete with the AI Layer, Copy Trade, Strategy Vault, and more, as well as the official release of RoseonX.</p>
<p><strong>4. How is the Roseon Exchange using Push’s web3 communication layer?</strong></p>
<p>At present, RoseonX users stay informed about updates through the Push feature by opting into <a href="http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RoseonX channels</a>. We're also in the process of integrating Push directly into RoseonX, allowing users to receive notifications right within our DEX.</p>
<p><strong>5. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?</strong></p>
<p>We've had community members share how the Push feature has been really helpful for them, as it keeps them directly informed through their MetaMask wallet.</p>
<p><strong>6. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?</strong></p>
<p>I'm genuinely excited about the Push chat between wallets. It's such a cool feature, especially with all the functionalities like group chat, video calls, spaces, and streaming. This feature has the potential to bring a whole new level of interaction and convenience to users, and I can't wait to see it in action.</p>

<p>Thanks, Elle for the awesome conversation. Looking forward to revolutionizing web3 communication together with Roseon!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of How Push Protocol Helps Build Thriving NFT and DeFi Communities Using Push Group Chats Blog " src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-f9f5895933518cea811176b969e8d1bf.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The NFT and DeFi landscapes are hotbeds of innovation but building a loyal and engaged community around your project can be a challenge. Traditional communication methods often fall short, leaving users scattered across different platforms and lacking a true sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Enter <strong>Push Protocol Group Chat</strong>, a revolutionary tool that empowers NFT brands and DeFi protocols to cultivate thriving communities through secure, token-gated experiences.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="benefits-of-token-gated-chats">Benefits of Token-Gated Chats<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-push-protocol-helps-build-thriving-nft-and-defi#benefits-of-token-gated-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benefits of Token-Gated Chats" title="Direct link to Benefits of Token-Gated Chats">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Engagement:</strong>&nbsp;Exclusive access creates a sense of value and incentivizes deeper participation within the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stronger Brand Loyalty:</strong>&nbsp;Token-gated chats foster a sense of belonging and exclusivity, strengthening the bond between users and your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Targeted Communication:</strong>&nbsp;Connect directly with your most engaged user base, ensuring your message reaches the right audience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unstoppable Domains: Powering Communities with Human-Readable Addresses:</strong></p>
<p>Push Protocol seamlessly integrates with <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unstoppable Domains (UD)</a>. This allows users to join group chats using their UD (e.g., yourname.nft) instead of complex wallet addresses. This enhances user experience and makes it easier for new members to join the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Taking it a Step Further: Gated Roles with Guild.xyz:</strong></p>
<p>Push Protocol's partnership with <a href="https://guild.xyz/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guild.xyz</a> unlocks even more possibilities for community management. You can now leverage Guild roles to create additional access tiers within your token-gated chat.</p>
<p>Imagine offering exclusive channels within your main chat, accessible only to users with specific Guild roles (e.g., early adopters, high-volume traders). This allows you to tailor the chat experience to different user segments and cater to their unique needs.</p>
<p><strong>Examples in Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A limited-edition NFT collection can create a token-gated chat where holders can discuss upcoming collaborations and access exclusive artwork previews.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the <a href="https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1777929898784444842?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pudgy Penguin's Unstopabble Domains token gated group chat</a> powered by Push Protocol, where only Pudgy Penguin Hodlers can join and communicate with each other and share their sense of community pride!</p>
<ul>
<li>A DeFi platform like <a href="https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curve</a> can offer a tiered chat system, with basic access for all token holders and a dedicated channel for high-level stakers to discuss governance proposals and advanced strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Push Protocol empowers NFT brands and DeFi protocols to build vibrant, engaged communities that drive long-term success. By fostering a sense of exclusivity, targeted communication, and deeper connections, Push Protocol unlocks the true potential of Web3 communities.</p>

<p>We're back with Frens of Push, offering a deep dive into the top protocols and Push ecosystem partners. This week, our fren is QuickSwap, the leading DEX &amp; AMM on Polygon.</p>
<p>QuickSwap is the leading DEX on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, and Dogechain that’s fully decentralized and community-driven, building a comprehensive suite of DeFi products called the DragonFi ecosystem. It’s renowned for its high-performance, cost-efficient DeFi platforms, and pioneering role in onboarding new users and capital to the broader Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p>By way of this collaboration, Push provides QuickSwap with the infrastructure to facilitate its users by alerting users to swap events and changing token prices, as well as for V3 liquidity alerts. QuickSwap relies on Push’s communication layer to deliver in-app notifications while ensuring a decentralized relay and storage.</p>
<p>In this episode of “Frens of Push”, Roc, Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/QuickSwapDEX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@QuickSwapDEX</a>, joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push and QuickSwap has the potential to disrupt web3 communication.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="hi-roc-whats-your-story-how-did-you-become-involved-in-building-in-the-blockchain-space-what-are-you-working-on-now">Hi Roc, what’s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#hi-roc-whats-your-story-how-did-you-become-involved-in-building-in-the-blockchain-space-what-are-you-working-on-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hi Roc, what’s your story?

<p><b>Roc:</b> I’ve been around the Web3 space for a long time – since the early days of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a libertarian, Bitcoin was my first love so to speak. As an elegant solution to an age-old monetary dilemma that has plagued humanity, I was on board and extremely interested right away.</p>
<p>However, as the Web3 industry has grown and evolved around Bitcoin, my interests have evolved as well in the years since I discovered Bitcoin. Today, I see the power of decentralized systems as being capable of resolving far more problems than just sound money. The power of decentralized finance to free up dormant capital, vastly improve capital efficiency, and provide individuals across the world with a more level playing field and opportunities to invest and capitalize on their skills excites me very much.</p>
<p>Today, I am leading Lunar Digital Assets (LDA), a premier marketing agency and incubator that helps rising Web3 projects to get the most out of their technology. We specialize in brand building, narrative formation, and effective marketing strategies. QuickSwap is one of our long-time clients, and we go way back with the team at Polygon Labs, too. At LDA, We see a great deal of promise in the ecosystem being developed in Polygon 2.0, and we are positioning QuickSwap to be a key player in all things Polygon DeFi. Keep an eye on us!</p>

<p><b>Roc:</b> QuickSwap is the premier DeFi suite on Polygon, bar none. Since the infamous 2020 DeFi wave, QuickSwap has been committed to providing Web3 users of all demographics with the simplest, most intuitive user experience possible. On this accord, QuickSwap has served as an evangelizing force for Polygon’s scalability stack, in the mission to drive down costs and transaction times. More recently, QuickSwap has acted as a first mover deploying on Polygon’s latest high-performance chain, zkEVM as well.</p>
<p>With QuickSwap, whether you’re looking to swap, stake, and farm on a lightning-fast DEX or trade high-stakes perpetual contracts, you know you’re going to get the best of everything. The latest features, the slickest user experience, the lowest fees, and of course, true decentralization. Between the QuickSwap DAO’s governance votes and discussions, and Polygon’s decentralized architecture, users no longer have to choose between high-performance decentralized systems and user-friendly UIs – with QuickSwap, it’s the best of everything, all in one place.</p>

<p><b>Roc:</b> Developers are free and welcome to explore QuickSwap’s documentation and to connect with the team to send in suggestions, new ideas, and business development proposals. QuickSwap has been integrating new technologies on a monthly basis for years now – not to mention integrating QuickSwap’s platforms on new and rising Polygon CDK chains. For the technical folks out there, go right ahead and check out <a href="https://github.com/QuickSwap/quickswap-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuickSwap’s GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><b>Roc:</b> I’m glad you asked! QuickSwap released its plans for DragonFi 2.0 in December 2023, and I have to say: that the project has been delivering right on schedule. QuickSwap’s DragonFi 2.0 initiative focuses on deploying the QuickSwap DeFi suite – a QuickSwap Citadel, as it’s called – to as many newly arriving Polygon CDK (Chain Development Kit) chains as possible. The mission is simple: to become the dominant DeFi force on Polygon 2.0, and eventually, to conquer the entire Web3 DeFi scene as the go-to homebase for ultra-high-performance, ultra-low-cost, ultra-liquid….well, you get it.</p>
<p>This year, QuickSwap has stayed true to its word, deploying Citadels on a number of new Polygon chains, including zkAstar, Immutable zkEVM, and Manta Pacific. The movement is underway, and QuickSwap’s user base and key metrics are growing every week.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-is-quickswap-using-pushs-web3-communication-layer">How is QuickSwap using Push’s web3 communication layer?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#how-is-quickswap-using-pushs-web3-communication-layer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How is QuickSwap using Push’s web3 communication layer?" title="Direct link to How is QuickSwap using Push’s web3 communication layer?">​</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> At present, QuickSwap is using the Push communication layer to alert users as to swap events, and changing token prices, as well as for V3 liquidity alerts – for instance, when a user’s liquidity falls out of range.</p>
<p>But there’s a lot more in the works and on the way. Already, QuickSwap has plans to leverage the Push communication layer to keep users informed with a range of new notifications, including those related to perpetual contracts, limit order and TWAP limit order execution, new farm and bond deployment, and the conclusion and closure of various farming opportunities. There’s a lot to look forward to in the world of QuickSwap – thanks to the whole team over at Push.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-would-you-describe-your-experience-using-push-what-benefits-have-you-seen">How would you describe your experience using Push?

<p><b>Roc:</b> Above all, Push is super user-friendly and intuitive. As a project fully committed to delivering a best-in-class user experience, QuickSwap is of the opinion that using Web3 ecosystems should be as simple as possible. Otherwise, onboarding ain’t happening. On that thread, setting up notifications should be just as easy as receiving them. Thankfully, Push has absolutely nailed it in the communications department and is setting up a much-needed set of communications tooling and services.</p>
<p>For QuickSwap, that means improving user experience for traders is easier than ever before – you might call it the best user experience experience on the market!</p>

<p><b>Roc:</b> As the world continues to migrate to the on-chain domain, notifications will become absolutely necessary built-in features – especially for Layer 1 transactions that necessarily involve some degree of latency. Transaction confirmations aren’t the only examples – as SocialFi expands, on-chain identity tooling picks up traction, and payment rails integrate digital assets, notifications will become essential for users to utilize decentralized systems and their native assets with confidence. Push is standing at the very frontier of digital innovation – right alongside QuickSwap, that is!</p>

<p><b>Roc:</b> In the QuickSwap community, everyone is very, very excited about the interoperable Polygon 2.0 ecosystem that is beginning to take form. Simply put, the ease of deployment provided by Polygon CDK and the immense benefits that chains and their users are reaping from unified liquidity and seamless interoperability is going to revolutionize what is possible in Web3.</p>
<p>In the Layer 2 race, QuickSwap is proud to be utilizing the next generation of rising Polygon technologies, yet again. The project invites new users, developer teams, and other enthusiasts from around the space to check out Web3’s most epic scalability stack yet for themselves!</p>

<p>The decentralized revolution is upon us, with DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) leading the charge. However, fostering strong communication and community engagement in these fast-paced ecosystems can be a challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Protocol</a> emerges as a game-changer, offering a secure and scalable solution for DeFi and NFT brands to connect with their user base effectively. Let's delve into how Push Protocol empowers these brands in two key areas: sending notifications and managing communities.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="seamless-notification-delivery">Seamless Notification Delivery:<a href="https://push.org/blog/revolutionising-communication-for-defi-and-nft-with-push#seamless-notification-delivery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Seamless Notification Delivery:" title="Direct link to Seamless Notification Delivery:">​</a></h3>
<p>Gone are the days of unreliable social media notifications and clunky email lists. Push Protocol enables DeFi and NFT brands to deliver real-time, secure notifications directly to users' crypto wallets. This ensures critical updates, price fluctuations, governance proposals, and exclusive announcements reach your audience instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Push Protocol Notifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased User Engagement:</strong>&nbsp;Real-time updates keep users informed and involved, fostering a more active and engaged community around your DeFi or NFT project.
Think of <a href="https://lido.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lido</a>, broadcasting regular reward updates to its users who have staked various tokens!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Transparency:</strong>&nbsp;Ensure users are always in the loop with critical announcements and governance proposals delivered directly to their wallets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, DAOs like <a href="https://www.mantle.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitDAO</a> can send any new proposal alerts staright to the voting member's wallet address.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong>&nbsp;Streamline communication by eliminating the need for users to constantly check social media or email for updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defi Protocol's like the <a href="https://app.push.org/channels/0xA2dEe32662F6243dA539bf6A8613F9A9e39843D3?utm_source=Dapp&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angle Protocol</a> leverages Push, to notify its subscriber users with periodic position status updates!</p>
<p><strong>Here's how Push Protocol notifications work in action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DeFi platforms like <a href="https://app.push.org/channels/0xAA940b3501176af328423d975C350d0d1BaAae50?utm_source=Dapp&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aave</a> send real-time health factor warning alerts to their users, helping them avoid liquidation risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NFT marketplaces or communities can notify its users about upcoming drops or exclusive minting opportunities.
Similar to the <a href="https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1777929898784444842?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pudgy Penguin's Unstopabble Domains token gated group chat</a> powered by Push Protocol.</p>
</li>
</ul>
