Hi EPNS frens 👋🏽! In the blink of an eye we’ve come to the final stretch of Q2. Lots of things are coming together nicely, and it’s time for a recap!

Development 🏗️
Let’s start with something super cool on the Development front — our revamped Documentation Hub: https://docs.epns.io/hub/

After our participation in ETH Amsterdam and DevConnect our team set on a mission to take all lessons learned and come up with world class documentation for everyone! We created a very extensive and comprehensive documentation for developers, services, and end users. Additionally, we prepared a youtube playlist covering the many aspects of EPNS and its usage — [the EPNS 101 series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyWTqFLqKt9a2WVohtCzzsdo6GVpu1uTw). Make sure to check it out!


Many other things worked this month are the result of feedback from the community and our collaborations, other things are us following our roadmap to ensure we achieve all our goals for this 2022. Some of the development efforts that took place this month are:

- Tested and validation of sending Notifications through the Polygon network. Coming soon!!!
- Sign-in with multiple wallets in the mobile app finalized testing and its rolling out soon!
- Prod and Staging Browser extensions are live with fresh new look n’ feel
- Currently working on a new type of secret notification… 🤐
- EPNS Smart Contracts v2 in development with features like claiming of rewards, updating of channel details, and more!
- EPNS Analytics Dashboard, a one-stop-shop to showcase all crucial data points is in the works.
- One of the most awaited Showrunners channel is in the works! — The Wallet Tracker is coming very soon!

Also, we highly recommend this month that you read our blog on how EPNS aims to solve one of the significant challenges faced by DAO operations — Communication. Check out this article — [Boosting DAO Infrastructure & Operations Tooling With EPNS](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/boosting-dao-infrastructure-and-operations-tooling-by-leveraging-epns-as-the-communication-layer-b8a075d9ad84)

Finally, our always open invitation to join us on Discord to participate in our discussions, make questions, and ask for any help you need while working on your projects implementing EPNS!

#### Governance 🗳️
After our Rockstars of EPNS Program came to an end, we continued our efforts towards solidifying our Governance and laying the foundation for all the things coming ahead for EPNS. We observed an important increase in community participation in our Office hours, PUSH Grants Program, and also submitting PUSH Improvement Proposals (PIPs).

- [PIP-05: Lend Funds to Provide Liquidity Provisioning from Community Treasury](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1524313370811412481?s=20&t=Uv5U-F13rHJkNX659gcj1A) was approved by Push Governance.
- [PUSH Grant approved!] [Social3](https://gov.epns.io/t/pgp-proposal-social3-epns/546) — the first-ever Web3 based social hiring platform that incorporates a refer-&-earn model but for talent.
- [PUSH Grant Approved!] [Chainwhiz](https://gov.epns.io/t/pgp-proposal-chainwhiz-epns-notifications-on-open-source-bounty-marketplace/578) — A bounty marketplace for Web3 projects, builders, and communities.
- [PIP] The [proposal to reimburse channel-creation gas fees](https://gov.epns.io/t/pip-06-reimburse-channel-creation-gas-fees-in-push-on-developer-request/635) just made it to formal voting at the very end of this month!

We have four more very interest proposals ongoing, don’t miss the opportunity to actively participate in important decisions for EPNS and also submit your own proposals! PUSH Grants are still running, and there is still plenty of opportunity to participate.

We’ll be announcing more Governance related initiatives very soon. Stay tuned!
