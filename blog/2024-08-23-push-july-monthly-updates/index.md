<!--truncate-->

July was a monumental month for Push Protocol as we hit the huge milestone of [**100 Million**](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1824491148229898313) Push Notifications. More than 8.91 Million Notifications were sent with a cumulative 241k subscribers reached ending the month on a high note marking significant progress in protocol user engagement, development, and community growth.

With all of this in mind, we are excited to share the highlights:

### Product Updates:

Our [website](https://push.org/) has undergone a revamp, as we:

- Performed various bug fixes for better UX.
- Uploaded several new [articles](https://push.org/blog/) focused on developer engagement and protocol growth announcements.
