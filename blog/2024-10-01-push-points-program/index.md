Push is excited to announce Phase 1 of [Push Points Program](https://app.push.org/points?utm_source=push_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Push+Points&utm_content=blog_post) aimed at giving back to the community and devs who have supported Push every step of the way and helped us reach greater heights. Push changed the game with the invention of Notifications and a communication layer for blockchains. Push is set to disrupt the web3 space with an upcoming evolution for the future of consumers on the blockchain. We’re working on something super exciting and want to bring you along for the ride.

## Earn Rewards for Activities (On and Offchain)

Push is committed to building the decentralized communication layer for web3. By participating in the points program, you can directly contribute to our growth and empower our vision.

We have designed the points program from the ground up to incentivize users by rewarding points for a variety of activities done using your favorite protocol, Push. Activities include but are not limited to participating on our socials, performing tasks on Push, staking and much more. Activities are shaped in a way where loyal users who interact with Push will be rewarded and have a fair chance of climbing the leaderboard.

## How to Earn Points

> **Note:** Please ensure the address you connect for the points program has at-least 1 Tx on ETH. We do this to ensure gaming the system is kept to a minimum among other steps.
>
> Getting started is fairly simple. Follow these steps to start earning today:

**How to Register (required):**

1. Connect your X account and Follow [@PushChain](https://x.com/PushChain)
2. Connect your Discord profile and Join [Push Discord](http://discord.gg/pushprotocol) Server.

> **Note:** We perform multiple checks to ensure your twitter account is legitimate. Verification may take up to 24 hours. If the verification fails, please make sure you are following @PushChain and have at-least 50 followers.
>
> Once the first two steps are done, you have successfully registered for Push Points Program. You can start minting points by completing various activities. Do make sure to keep checking your Points dashboard for a new set of tasks each week. You don’t want to miss out on some of these bonus rewards!

## Daily Check-in

## Multipliers

Multipliers allow users to boost their Points by performing special activities. For e.g. if you have 100 points, after earning a 2x Multiplier, you will now have 200 Points. Multipliers also apply to any points earned after activating the Multiplier making it a permanent feature. Watch out @PushChain on X for bonus activities to earn Multipliers.

Multipliers are associated with high-impact activities to make sure top contributors to the platform are rewarded accordingly.

> **Note:** Multipliers are additive. A 2X + 2X Multiplier will make the account multiplier 4X. Collect more multipliers to earn mega rewards.

## Onboard New Users on Push. Earn Points.

Users will notice a special link on their Push Points Dashboard. Share this with your friends and new users to earn +12% of any Points your invites earn, and +2% of any Points your invite’s invites earn.

## When will Phase I end?

Phase 1 will last for 16 weeks with a big bang announcement following a reveal of rewards for collected points. We’re super excited for the reveal and are sure the community will be thrilled with what they find. The more points you accumulate on the leaderboard, the bigger the rewards!

## Under what circumstances can I lose my points?

Points may also be forfeited due to farming by unfair means or failure to meet the stated eligibility criteria.
