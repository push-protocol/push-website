We're back with Frens of Push, offering a deep dive into the top protocols and Push ecosystem partners. This week, our fren is QuickSwap, the leading DEX & AMM on Polygon.

QuickSwap is the leading DEX on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, and Dogechain that’s fully decentralized and community-driven, building a comprehensive suite of DeFi products called the DragonFi ecosystem. It’s renowned for its high-performance, cost-efficient DeFi platforms, and pioneering role in onboarding new users and capital to the broader Polygon ecosystem.

By way of this collaboration, Push provides QuickSwap with the infrastructure to facilitate its users by alerting users to swap events and changing token prices, as well as for V3 liquidity alerts. QuickSwap relies on Push’s communication layer to deliver in-app notifications while ensuring a decentralized relay and storage.

In this episode of “Frens of Push”, Roc, Founder [@QuickSwapDEX](https://twitter.com/QuickSwapDEX), joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push and QuickSwap has the potential to disrupt web3 communication.

### Hi Roc, what’s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?

<b>Roc:</b> I’ve been around the Web3 space for a long time – since the early days of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a libertarian, Bitcoin was my first love so to speak. As an elegant solution to an age-old monetary dilemma that has plagued humanity, I was on board and extremely interested right away.

However, as the Web3 industry has grown and evolved around Bitcoin, my interests have evolved as well in the years since I discovered Bitcoin. Today, I see the power of decentralized systems as being capable of resolving far more problems than just sound money. The power of decentralized finance to free up dormant capital, vastly improve capital efficiency, and provide individuals across the world with a more level playing field and opportunities to invest and capitalize on their skills excites me very much.

Today, I am leading Lunar Digital Assets (LDA), a premier marketing agency and incubator that helps rising Web3 projects to get the most out of their technology. We specialize in brand building, narrative formation, and effective marketing strategies. QuickSwap is one of our long-time clients, and we go way back with the team at Polygon Labs, too. At LDA, We see a great deal of promise in the ecosystem being developed in Polygon 2.0, and we are positioning QuickSwap to be a key player in all things Polygon DeFi. Keep an eye on us!

### Tell us about QuickSwap — what’s it about and what problem does QuickSwap solve?

<b>Roc:</b> QuickSwap is the premier DeFi suite on Polygon, bar none. Since the infamous 2020 DeFi wave, QuickSwap has been committed to providing Web3 users of all demographics with the simplest, most intuitive user experience possible. On this accord, QuickSwap has served as an evangelizing force for Polygon’s scalability stack, in the mission to drive down costs and transaction times. More recently, QuickSwap has acted as a first mover deploying on Polygon’s latest high-performance chain, zkEVM as well.

With QuickSwap, whether you’re looking to swap, stake, and farm on a lightning-fast DEX or trade high-stakes perpetual contracts, you know you’re going to get the best of everything. The latest features, the slickest user experience, the lowest fees, and of course, true decentralization. Between the QuickSwap DAO’s governance votes and discussions, and Polygon’s decentralized architecture, users no longer have to choose between high-performance decentralized systems and user-friendly UIs – with QuickSwap, it’s the best of everything, all in one place.

### How do developers use QuickSwap?

<b>Roc:</b> Developers are free and welcome to explore QuickSwap’s documentation and to connect with the team to send in suggestions, new ideas, and business development proposals. QuickSwap has been integrating new technologies on a monthly basis for years now – not to mention integrating QuickSwap’s platforms on new and rising Polygon CDK chains. For the technical folks out there, go right ahead and check out [QuickSwap’s GitHub](https://github.com/QuickSwap/quickswap-docs).

### What’s the 2024 plan for QuickSwap and its ecosystem?

<b>Roc:</b> I’m glad you asked! QuickSwap released its plans for DragonFi 2.0 in December 2023, and I have to say: that the project has been delivering right on schedule. QuickSwap’s DragonFi 2.0 initiative focuses on deploying the QuickSwap DeFi suite – a QuickSwap Citadel, as it’s called – to as many newly arriving Polygon CDK (Chain Development Kit) chains as possible. The mission is simple: to become the dominant DeFi force on Polygon 2.0, and eventually, to conquer the entire Web3 DeFi scene as the go-to homebase for ultra-high-performance, ultra-low-cost, ultra-liquid….well, you get it.

This year, QuickSwap has stayed true to its word, deploying Citadels on a number of new Polygon chains, including zkAstar, Immutable zkEVM, and Manta Pacific. The movement is underway, and QuickSwap’s user base and key metrics are growing every week.

### How is QuickSwap using Push’s web3 communication layer?

<b>Roc:</b> At present, QuickSwap is using the Push communication layer to alert users as to swap events, and changing token prices, as well as for V3 liquidity alerts – for instance, when a user’s liquidity falls out of range.

But there’s a lot more in the works and on the way. Already, QuickSwap has plans to leverage the Push communication layer to keep users informed with a range of new notifications, including those related to perpetual contracts, limit order and TWAP limit order execution, new farm and bond deployment, and the conclusion and closure of various farming opportunities. There’s a lot to look forward to in the world of QuickSwap – thanks to the whole team over at Push.

### How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?

<b>Roc:</b> Above all, Push is super user-friendly and intuitive. As a project fully committed to delivering a best-in-class user experience, QuickSwap is of the opinion that using Web3 ecosystems should be as simple as possible. Otherwise, onboarding ain’t happening. On that thread, setting up notifications should be just as easy as receiving them. Thankfully, Push has absolutely nailed it in the communications department and is setting up a much-needed set of communications tooling and services.

For QuickSwap, that means improving user experience for traders is easier than ever before – you might call it the best user experience experience on the market!

### What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?

<b>Roc:</b> As the world continues to migrate to the on-chain domain, notifications will become absolutely necessary built-in features – especially for Layer 1 transactions that necessarily involve some degree of latency. Transaction confirmations aren’t the only examples – as SocialFi expands, on-chain identity tooling picks up traction, and payment rails integrate digital assets, notifications will become essential for users to utilize decentralized systems and their native assets with confidence. Push is standing at the very frontier of digital innovation – right alongside QuickSwap, that is!

### What is your take on the future of DeFi on Polygon and how QuickSwap plans to leverage it?

<b>Roc:</b> In the QuickSwap community, everyone is very, very excited about the interoperable Polygon 2.0 ecosystem that is beginning to take form. Simply put, the ease of deployment provided by Polygon CDK and the immense benefits that chains and their users are reaping from unified liquidity and seamless interoperability is going to revolutionize what is possible in Web3.

In the Layer 2 race, QuickSwap is proud to be utilizing the next generation of rising Polygon technologies, yet again. The project invites new users, developer teams, and other enthusiasts from around the space to check out Web3’s most epic scalability stack yet for themselves!
