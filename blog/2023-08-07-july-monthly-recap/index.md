July has been nothing short of extraordinary! We made some groundbreaking developments that have taken Push to new heights. Let‚Äôs dive into the major achievements that have shaped our journey this month.

## Development‚öíÔ∏è

Most notably, we‚Äôre thrilled to [unveil Push V2!](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-v2-is-live-new-rewards-utility-functionality-4d591284209d)

This update introduces exciting new features including brand [new yield farming rewards via Push Fee Pool Staking](https://medium.com/push-protocol/new-push-yield-farming-rewards-full-details-4a9ff473226d), Incentivized Chat functionality, [all-new Push Spaces](https://push-protocol.medium.com/push-spaces-is-live-decentralized-audio-and-video-streaming-is-here-bc77deed16ca) and Customized Profiles. All these features aim at empowering users, rewarding participation, creating a circular economy to democratize web3 communication and expand the horizons of dApp UX possibilities. We‚Äôre excited for the future!

Another major highlight of July was the [launch of $PUSH token on Polygon and Quickswap](https://push-protocol.medium.com/push-is-live-on-polygon-quickswap-b683ef0f71d8), providing multi-chain accessibility, usability, and composability. This launch, coupled with the Push v2 launch, unlocks new utility for $PUSH, creating endless possibilities for developers within the Polygon ecosystem.

Following the successful launch of $PUSH on Polygon, we launched the [$PUSH-USDC lending & borrowing pool on Timeswap](https://push-protocol.medium.com/pushing-ahead-in-time-push-x-timeswap-6a94edaffc03), enabling users to borrow $PUSH at a fixed interest rate and lend $PUSH to earn a fixed interest rate. All enriched by Timeswap‚Äôs non-liquidatable loans & adjustable APR features.

There‚Äôs more! We continue to elevate the Push experience as we [unveiled Push Spaces](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-spaces-is-live-decentralized-audio-and-video-streaming-is-here-bc77deed16ca), a decentralized, incentivized, community-based streaming solution for the future of online communication. With Push Spaces, we‚Äôre continuing to build out the decentralized communication space by providing the web3 with better UX, privacy, and censorship-resistant communication solutions.

## Frens of Pushüíú

July was brimming with exciting partnerships, forging a stronger web3 communication ecosystem for Push and our frens. We‚Äôre excited to have new members in the fam:
