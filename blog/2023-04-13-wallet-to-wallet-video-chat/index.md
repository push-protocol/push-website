# Push Video is live, allowing web3 users to video chat without intermediaries.<br/>

Today, Push Protocol is excited to announce the launch of Push Video! Push Video is the first wallet-to-wallet video chat that allows web3 users to video chat with each other live. Get started at [app.push.org](https://app.push.org/chat)!

Push Protocol began with push notifications to web3 in January 2022 on Ethereum. Since then, Push has expanded to Polygon and BNB Chain. In October 2022 at Devcon in Bogota, we announced the launch of Push Chat, our wallet-to-wallet messaging protocol. Since launch, Push Protocol has powered over 30M messages to 85,000+ users across 500+ integrations.

Built on the success of Push Notifications and Push Chat, we‚Äôre now excited to officially release Push Video!

The web3 social media and chat ecosystem is expanding rapidly today, but Push Video has always been our plan. Back in our [2020 whitepaper](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1590388512280711170?s=20), we referenced that decentralized video chat was on our timeline as a natural component to the web3 communication stack we built, starting with notifications. Also in Bogota, at Polygon Connect, we gave the community a [preview of Push Video](https://twitter.com/harshrajat/status/1579628569453813760?s=20), which was then under development. Between Bogota and today‚Äôs announcement, we‚Äôve built off the success of Push Protocol notifications and Push Chat to expand the ecosystem of decentralized social networking.

What can you do with Push Video? Well, anything you do with video today. Social chats, business meetings, customer support, streaming, gaming, telehealth, education and coaching ‚Äî the list goes on.

### Launching at Pragma Tokyo, ETH Global

Back in 2020, Push Protocol (then, EPNS) was born out of ETHGlobal 2020. Today, we are announcing Push Video during ETHGlobal in Tokyo, at the [Pragma](https://ethglobal.com/events/pragma-tokyo) event.

After Push Chat, Push Video is the second major social networking product to be launched by Push Protocol. We will continue to develop these products, adding features like group and streaming. Soon in our roadmap we have web3 ‚ÄúTwitter spaces like experience‚Äù, allowing communities to come together on decentralized online forum. All of these products will be tied together by the fundamental notifications layer that we have built and scaled to date. Piece by piece, Push Protocol is building the decentralized social networking ecosystem for all users of the future internet.

### The Push Developer Video SDK

The Push Developer Video SDK is launching soon! The SDK will give app developers an easy way to start integrating decentralized notifications, chat, and/or video directly into their applications. We‚Äôll be launching the SDK imminently, so join the #dev-chat channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol) to learn more.
