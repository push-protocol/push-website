Over the next 3 months, along with our awesome partners Push will be traveling to 18 cities across India to conduct workshops and present challenges which you can compete to solve and in turn win over $5,000+ prizes for each problem you solve. The total prize pool is $55,000 USD.

## India, Web3, and the Developer Community

India is home to some of the worldâ€™s best developers and projects, and its prominence in web3 continues to grow. Behind the globally-recognized web3 projects coming out of India, we know there is a tremendous community of incredible developers and projects that deserve more recognition and resources. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re hitting the road and visiting university campuses across India to meet you face-to-face and foster growth where it truly matters â€” at the grassroots level.

As a grassroots project that started from a ETHGlobal 2020 hackathon ourselves, the Push team understands the importance of providing opportunities to skilled developers who may not have sufficient access to hackathons or other web3 growth channels. As such, we and our partners are launching this campaign as a way of enabling every aspiring developer, founder, and curious student in cities across India to showcase their talents, unlock their full potential, and to catapult their careers.

If youâ€™ve been looking for an opportunity to make a name for yourself in web3 â€” this is it.

## Partners and Coding Challenges

Push is proud to announce the partners involved in Billion Reasons to Build. These global projects have significant contributions in building the Web3 ecosystem. When you join the Billion Reasons to Build campaign, you wonâ€™t just be proving to the web3 community your skills as a developer, youâ€™ll also have contributed to the growth of some of web3â€™s leading protocols.

Almost all the partner projects and protocols involved in the Billion Reasons to Build campaign have put up their own Coding Challenge, each of which offers $5,000 to the developer or team that best solves the problem.

These are complex coding challenges that are designed to test your abilities as a web3 developer. As such, the host protocol will select the best solution, not the first solution they receive for their Coding Challenge. This gives you maximum opportunity to impress with your best solution without needing to worry about rushing.

If selected as the winner, your solution will be used to build and enhace the respective protocol.

Partnering in the Billion Reasons to Build campaign to provide their own Challenges are:
