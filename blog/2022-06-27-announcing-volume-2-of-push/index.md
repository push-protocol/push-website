The second year of Push Rockstar NFTs is about to begin. Dive into the details and buckle up!

A year ago, we announced the [first volume](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf) of Push (prev EPNS) #ROCKSTARS on the heels of our IDOs. Each week for the following 52 weeks, we asked our community to participate in a small challenge. Meme competitions, explainers, tutorials, guides, threads, and more. You name it ‚Äî the community came together and created it. Each week, the winner of that competition was gifted 2,400 PUSH and one Rockstar NFT, each of which was designed by an Indian artist.

#### Today, we‚Äôre excited to kick off the second volume of Push Rockstars!

Following the drop rules of [Rockstars of Push (prev EPNS) Volume 1](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf), We‚Äôll be distributing one NFT a week (every Monday for the next 100 weeks üò±) to one community member who does something to help us push the envelope forward.

So what are some ideas for you to get Volume 2 drops? Well, in no particular order, here are some things community members have done for us in the past which we love üíñ

- Development blogs, workshops, explanations or any #buidl related things, the more creative it gets, the better
- Provided PRs for improvements on several of our SDKs / Frontend / Repos: https://github.com/push-protocol
- Written a blog post explaining an element of the protocol or token design very clearly ü§ì
- Created some killer memes about Push Protocol & push notifications for web3 üí™
- Or do anything which you have a knack for whether it‚Äôs getting people to build with Push, explanations, content, design, tweet threads, or whatever

### Rules for Participation?

The best way is to follow Push Protocol on [Twitter](https://x.com/PushChain) and join [Discord](https://discord.gg/YVPB99F9W5) to stay up to date when we announce each weekly competition. Every entry that tags [@PushChain](https://x.com/PushChain) and uses #Rockstars will be considered. Being active on Discord and gathering community love will play a role in nominations though winners (as always) will be decided through governance. Top-notch entries (even in earlier weeks) will be eligible in rolling weeks and sometimes the Push team will try to spruce things up sometimes with some cool creative weekly contests so do keep an eye out on our Twitter handle!

Rock on and join the Push community! üîîüßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë
