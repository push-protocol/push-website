<SubHeader>July 2022</SubHeader>

July flew by in the blink of an eye, and as we go deeper into Q3 more things are coming together nicely. This second half of the year is looking to be loaded with many new features and so many great news.

Let’s do our thing and recap briefly all the happenings during July.

## Development 🏗️
This month the Development team have made tons of progress in all fronts. Preparing backend tooling for monitoring, working on the PUSH Nodes, improvements to our dApp & SDKs, and of course one of out most awaited features — Wallet to Wallet communication.

- The <b>Analytics Dashboard</b> have been in development to provide services with insights about notifications and their channels. The entire backend Integration is done, and the Dashboard will be released very soon.
- With <b>PUSH Nodes</b> being a central piece in the EPNS ecosystem, optimization together with the standardization of payloads plays a critical role to ensure its optimal functionality. As we start making it publicly available anyone will be able to submit an improvement proposals for it.
- On the decentralizing of PUSH Nnodes side, we are segregating nodes into modules. So, participants can spin up their own node and provide the service to the network to send notifications
- The <b>EPNS Smart Contract v1.5 Audit</b> is coming to its last stage. Many new features will come together as we deploy this new version of the smart contracts. More details will be provided soon!
- Content markdown standards for frontend SDK are in the works.
- <b>Wallet to Wallet</b> code reviews are done. Currently going over extensive testing and also working with design team to provide a great UI ready for launch.
- <b>EPNS dApp UI/UX improvements</b> for a better experience for channel creators and users. Also working on getting the sending notifications ready for multi-chain support.

With so many development efforts happening concurrently, there is so much room for conversation and discussion. We encourage everyone to join us on our Discord to participate and brainstorm ideas. We highly appreciate our community involvement to ensure every release is rock solid.


## Frens of EPNS 🎎
No month recap would be complete without briefly mentioning the Frens we made this month, and what we are building together with them:

Together with these awesome new frens, we have also been working together with many more teams doing their own implementations of EPNS notifications.

As usual, we take every collaboration opportunity as a learning experience to improve our product offering and be up to speed with the web3 needs.

No one said building the communication layer for the web3 was going to be an easy task, however counting with the support of such an engaged community and team are making it a reality. It’s time to put pedal to the metal and get ready for an exciting second half of 2022.

Let’s keep PUSHing! 💪

### About Push Protocol

Push is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.
