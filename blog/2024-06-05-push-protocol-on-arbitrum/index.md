To all the builders and 1.6M active wallets on [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), get ready â€“ because we've arrived!

Bringing with us our full suite of web3-native communication tools: [Push Notifications](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/), [Chat](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/), [Custom Gated Group Chat](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/build/create-group/) to enhance the user experience on Arbitrum.

We're absolutely thrilled to be leading a new era of decentralized communication within one of the fastest-growing blockchains in web3 and canâ€™t wait to see the all-new usability, multi-communication interoperability, and dApp user-experience enhancements that are already on the way. Leveraging the power of Arbitrum's scalable, fast, and secure Layer 2 solutions, Push notifications enable real-time alerts for various blockchain activities such as transaction confirmations, governance proposals, DeFi updates, and NFT drops.

So what else is there to know and get excited about? Letâ€™s dive in.

### Arbitrum x Push Protocol - Revolutionizing Decentralized Interaction 

Since our mainnet launch in January 2022, Push has emerged as the go-to communication layer for over 700+ of the world's leading dApps on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/), [Polygon zkEVM](https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm), [Linea](https://linea.build/) and other blockchains.

Now, weâ€™re expanding our privacy-centric communication product suite to the leading Layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum, Arbitrum. With over [45.1% of the Ethereum Layer-2](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/ethereum-l2-arbitrum-base/#:~:text=It%20boasts%20a%20market%20share,a%20TVL%20of%20%247.93b.) market share and a TVL of over $15.42 Billion â€“ Arbitrum provides some of the best tools for building scalable dApps on Ethereum and has an incredibly active user-base (with 971M in total DeFi transactions across 1.6M active wallets as of June 2024).

As such, what makes this integration so exciting is the potential utility and enhancement possibilities. Leveraging Push Notifications, Chat, and Video, we look forward to integrating with leading Arbitrum dApps to enhance how dApps and users interact.

The best part of our integration: multi-chain communication. As we continue to expand our blockchain integrations, we open the door to better interoperability between users on different chains. This enhanced user-experience means fewer compromises in the way of interaction and engagement for users, and as a result, better adoption and user-stickiness. All this utility is driven by the communication infrastructure of Push Protocol.

### Push x Arbitrum: What to Expect

With the arrival of Push Protocol communication protocol, dApps and protocols on Arbitrum can begin building with web3-native notifications, chat, video, and spaces functionality. Hereâ€™s what you can build with each of these communication tools:

1. ðŸ””<b>Push Notifications</b>: Send and receive updates from your favorite Arbitrum dApps directly into your wallet â€“ enabling DeFi, News, NFT projects to share updates and alerts faster.
2. ðŸ’¬<b>Push Chat + Group Chat</b>: Enable wallet-to-wallet and wallet-to-dApp instant chat functionality â€“ opening the door to social media platforms, customer service tools, and other social interaction enhancements.
3. ðŸ“¹<b>Push Video and Space</b>: Face-to-face video chat directly on blockchain â€“ introducing all-new interactivity on social dApps and live-streaming.

Excitingly, weâ€™ve deployed the most up to date smart contracts of Push, [Push V2](https://push.org/blog/push-v2-is-live-new-rewards-utility-and-functionality/), on Arbitrum. Carrying over all the developments weâ€™ve launched so far, Customized Profiles, settings for [Notification Channels](https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings/), and notification integration with [MetaMask](https://push.org/blog/deep-dive-into-push-snaps-features-and-getting-started-all-the-technical-specifications-and-getting-started-tips-you-need/).
