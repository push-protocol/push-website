# „Åä„ÅØ„Çà„ÅÜÊù±‰∫¨~üå∏ Let‚Äôs push the boundaries of web3 communication by building something cool with Push at Japan‚Äôs largest web3 hackathon in history, ETHGlobal Tokyo!<br/>

A few weeks ago, we partnered with our frens at ETHGlobal for the [Scaling Ethereum 2023 hackathon](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1642145186473017344), where thousands of builders from around the world showcased their impressive work.

Now, we‚Äôre teaming up with ETHGlobal again for ETHGlobal Tokyo, and we‚Äôre challenging you to inspire and surprise the community with your projects using Push Protocol, the most widely used communication protocol in web3.

Be sure to also come hear our Founder and [CEO Harsh Rajat](https://twitter.com/harshrajat) speak at [Pragma ETHGlobal Tokyo](https://ethglobal.com/events/pragma-tokyo) for a special announcement on a new feature that will revolutionize how social networks communicate‚Ä¶

## Prize Breakdown

We‚Äôre excited to award multiple prizes totaling $5k for the best and most creative use cases, including:

- $1,500 ‚Äî <b>Grand Prize</b> for the most innovative project using Push Protocol
- $750 ‚Äî <b>Best Use Case</b> for Push Group Chat/video call integration
- $750 ‚Äî <b>Best UX</b> for Push integration (Push Notification and/or Push Chat)
- $2,000 ‚Äî <b>Pool Prize</b> for top 10 projects

## Getting Started with Push Protocol

Since Push Protocol went live three years ago, builders from the web3 ecosystem have built a variety of creative and useful use cases with Push, including DeFi, DAO, NFT, and Tooling. We‚Äôve put together some product requests and sample use cases to inspire you further.

Getting started is easy! Follow these simple steps to [create a channel](https://comms.push.org/docs/notifications/tutorials/create-your-channel/), as the first step for sending notifications via Push Protocol:

1. Go to http://staging.push.org and connect your wallet.
2. Once connected, go to Developer > Create Channel.
3. Fill in the Channel Name, Network, and Channel Website URL details.
4. Approve the transaction for 50 PUSH.
5. After the transaction is approved, approve the second transaction call.
6. Congratulations! Your channel has been successfully created, and you are all set to send or receive notifications.

And if you‚Äôre looking into Push Chat integration, head over to [Push Chat SDK](https://comms.push.org/docs/chat/) ‚Äî you‚Äôll be able to integrate wallet-to-wallet chat, whether it‚Äôs for customer support or group chat, with a few minutes.

Here‚Äôs all of our [previous workshops](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyWTqFLqKt9ZJIPvTjf6GHOn7u7_8h1DY).

We started building Push at the ETHGlobal hackathon in 2020, and the early feedback convinced us that it could be so much more. So who knows, it might be your project next that goes from Hackathon to web3 sensation!

We‚Äôre excited to see what you build at ETHTokyo, and the Push crew will be available to answer all your questions and offer support.

Join us for ETH Tokyo, and let‚Äôs push the boundaries of web3 communication together! We can‚Äôt wait to see what you build! üîî
