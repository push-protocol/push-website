Beyond just the introduction of PIPs though, there have been a host of improvements made including:

- The analytics dashboard backend API has been completed, and a new UI is in the works. This will provide platforms with insights about notifications and their channels.
- The wallet-to-wallet SDK continues to advance at a rapid pace.
- Push smart contracts v2 is taking strides this month.
- Frontend for Push chat is being refined as you read this.
- Governance Analytics API is in progress.
- Delivery nodes are undergoing extensive quality assurance to make them foolproof and battle-ready.
- New mobile app features will go live soon and bug fixes are being made in the app.

With so much happening on the development front and with the launch of PIP, we invite you all to join us and have a chat with our team on [Push Discord](https://discord.gg/pushprotocol). All the good conversations are happening there!
