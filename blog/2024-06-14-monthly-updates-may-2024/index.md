### Push DAO Updates:

To continue our journey of Push DAO towards progressive decentralization we introduced a new DAO framework, [Push DAO V2](https://gov.push.org/t/push-dao-v2-push-dao-council/1631). This framework simplifies the process for contributors and builders to engage with the DAO, with the support of the DAO Council. Further, we introduced [Push Improvement Proposal 1](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1792935339297816703) to advocate integrating the Open Frame standard and Frames into the Push Protocol Network and [PIP 2](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1796495237528887464) to enable reactions via emojis on chat messages.

We supported [DAO Spring](https://x.com/DAOcember/status/1788838927878516918) celebrating and encouraging the exceptional talent and innovation of builders in our community.
