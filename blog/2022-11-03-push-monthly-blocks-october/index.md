## Development üèóÔ∏è

The fun in the development team never ends. As we mentioned last month, many initiatives were coming together and this month they made it live!

### Push Protocol in Polygon Mainnet

October started strong with our announcement of Push Protocol deployed in Polygon Mainnet to bring world-class communication infrastructure to the Polygon ecosystem.

You can [read more here](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1575485566065381377?s=20&t=TdVmvodS54VtGSPTMr-Ovw&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) in case you missed it!

### Push Chat (Alpha)

A wallet-to-wallet communication protocol! We started development activities some time ago and Push Chat made it Live at the Polygon Connect event in Bogota. <b>Wanna give it a try?</b> Ping us on Discord!<br/><br/>

And it doesn‚Äôt end there. We are working to launch very soon the Push Chat SDK, which will enable hackers and development teams to implement wallet to wallet communication in your solutions!

Now, there are many other things that the dev team have been working on this month:

- The new browser extension of PUSH Protocol is now live on Staging & Prod. With this extension now consuming the new SDK for fetching notifications.
- The Push Protocol dApp is made it live on Staging and Prod with enhanced UI/UX and better performance
- Push Staging environment was migrated to Goerli Network üôèüèΩ
- CAIP implementation is in steady progress
- The analytics Dashboard is coming together nicely. The team is working on also integrating Governance key points to make it more complete to everyone.
- Our ever-green documentation was improved after all the great feedback provided by hackers during ETH Bogota.

And last, but not least‚Ä¶ Push Smart Contracts v2 is now in development. More news to come soon!
