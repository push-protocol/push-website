What a month itâ€™s been at Push! From groundbreaking features to new partnerships, weâ€™ve been on an exciting journey this June making major strides towards our mission of decentralizing communication in web3. We couldnâ€™t be more thrilled to share the highlights with you.

The spotlight of the month was undoubtedly the long-awaited [release of Push NFT Chat](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1666491248436297728?s=20). With this new feature, weâ€™ve opened up a universe of possibilities for the 1.5 million+ NFT wallets and collections including Azuki, BAYC, and CryptoPunks. Instant, secure, and immersive chats tied to your unique NFT assets are here. With its triple encryption and intuitive UX, Push NFT Chat is set to empower web3 native NFT-to-NFT and dApp-to-NFT communication like never before. Read all about it [here](https://medium.com/push-protocol/introducing-push-nft-chat-chats-and-comms-tied-to-your-nfts-done-right-98717c04438d). Also donâ€™t forget to check out the [demo](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1666859600161779733?s=20) and begin building!

Our development progress didnâ€™t stop there. Get ready to dive in!

## Development

- Weâ€™ve successfully completed the [Push Protocol v2 smart contract audit by Chainsafe](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1663910676513816578?s=20), furthering the $PUSH token utility and enabling new incentivization mechanisms for users. Be on the lookout for Push v2 soon.
- Weâ€™ve been addressing bugs and optimizing Push Video and Push Group Chat.
- Smart contract documentation of v2 functions is currently under progress.
- The final QA of Push Video on mobile has been initiated. The new version of the app will be rolled out once the QA is completed.
- The initial set-up for using Foundry in the Push Smart contracts repo is now completed.

## Frens of Push

Collaborations and partnerships are at the heart of our journey at Push. In June, we had the privilege of joining forces with exceptional projects, all united by the vision of advancing the web3 ecosystem. Letâ€™s take a look at all our new frenships:

## Push DAO and Community

We are excited to announce that both community calls and DAO governance calls have started weekly. These calls provide opportunities for community members to participate in shaping the direction of Push DAO. Donâ€™t miss out on your chance to contribute!

We were also delighted to witness a remarkable turnout during the [Push En EspaÃ±ol](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1669770430494769158?s=20) Discord call, where our Spanish-speaking community members came together to discuss all things Push.

Lastly, the ETH Global HackFS was a huge success with 55 awesome teams developing using Push Chat, Notification and Push Video. A huge congratulations to the [23 winning teams](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1673370078660939776) that grabbed Push bounties for their incredible Push integrations. We couldnâ€™t be happier to support these brilliant minds!
