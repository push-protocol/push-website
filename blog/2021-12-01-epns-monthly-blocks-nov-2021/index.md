**Development**🏗️️

We started the month strong with the big announcement of the successful [Audit of the EPNS Push Protocol V1!](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1455605451198906370?s=20)💥. This marks one of the most important milestones in the 2021 roadmap, as it enables & ensures EPNS is ready to support cross-chain interoperability.

Just a couple weeks later, we came up with a follow up on a Q3 Roadmap item that goes hand by hand with the EPNS Protocol v1— we turned **_Web3 Communication ON_**! with our [**Push Nodes P2P**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1463556448919568387?s=20)  🌐

Another important set of activities took place this month to ensure we keep our protocol up-to-date to meet the greatest standards:

*   Spam Box 📥 functionality progressing well. More updates soon 👀
*   The Showrunners framework is now fully validated against our Audited Protocol v1 contract 📦
*   The Showrunners Framework (Staging) is now fully functional with off-chain features. Users can now opt-in/opt-out by just signing a transaction with their wallets, and also **notifications** are being sent through off-chain transactions!
*   The entire Staging environment is now fully connected against Kovan! We are currently in the last phase of testing and validation. The MobileApp and PUSH Nodes were successfully migrated to Kovan as well.

We decided to use this important task, and confirm our migration scripts are rock solid. The Testnet migration was a success and now we are one step closer to Mainnet launch!

Another really important event this month was our participation in the Solana Breakpoint event. Why? We took it as a challenge and as an opportunity to put EPNS cross-chain compatibility to test by running EPNS on Solana. Test passed!✅ ([Check it out here](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1461016539176390659?s=20))
