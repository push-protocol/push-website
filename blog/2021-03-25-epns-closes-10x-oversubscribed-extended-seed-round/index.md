With our extended seed round, this group backing our vision to build the world’s first decentralized notification protocol now stands at over 35! To each one of them — thank you! The extended seed round will help us grow faster, and adds a variety of experience and strategic expertise that will help us build the communication pillar of Ethereum and Web 3.0.

Our extended seed investment happened through a private token agreement based on SAFT, giving away 5.5% of the (yet to be launched) governance token **$PUSH**.

# **Deep Dive**

[**True Ventures**](https://twitter.com/trueventures) is one the most founder-friendly VCs out there. Their experience and expertise in helping build world class companies is something we’re lucky to have with us. With their workshops, access to resources, and a proud “true family” founder and partner network, we are learning so much from the team.

We’re very excited to have the support of [**Binance Labs**](https://labs.binance.com/), the VC and incubator arm of global ecosystem player [**Binance**](https://twitter.com/binance), which invests in and supports fundamental components of the Web 3.0 infrastructure as a whole.

[**IOSG Ventures**](https://twitter.com/IOSGVC) is helping us build a strong community in the China region and has already started introducing us to their portfolio companies.

[**Bixin Capital**](http://bixincapital.com/) is an amazing team that is always there to advise and brainstorm on a whole array of issues, from community- building in China, growth, token economics, and more.

[**Bitscale**](https://bitscale.capital/) has been helping us with marketing and community building strategies.

[**Sandeep Nailwal**](https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal) is a force to be reckoned with! His “how may I help” attitude for everyone he comes in contact with is something we all love. He’s showered us with solid advice on making sure our journey is guided by his wisdom and experience running one of the most successful companies in this space.

We had an instant connection with [**Ajit Tripathi**](https://twitter.com/chainyoda) that led us down a rabbit hole of many beautiful coincidences. We are honored to have his expertise in decentralized finance with us.

We’ve been lucky to be working with [**Kaito**](https://twitter.com/CoffeeTimesTW) building our community and project awareness initiatives in Japan.
