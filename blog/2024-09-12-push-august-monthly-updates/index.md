August was a notable month for Push, marked by significant milestones related to user engagement, feature development, and overall community growth. [Push Protocol](https://push.org/) sent over 10.2 Million New Notifications in August, reaching a cumulative [242k subscribers](https://push.network/dashboard), showcasing substantial progress in user engagement, development, and community growth.

Here's a quick recap of all the exciting updates:

We're thrilled to announce that Push has reached a significant milestone: over 100 million notifications sent all-time. This is something that we've dreamed of since we began this journey to empower, enable, and unify web3 with native communication.

As a key step towards achieving our mission of becoming the communication hub for all blockchains, we debuted one of our strongest protocol upgrades - [Pre PIP 3: Cross Chain Requests](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1821607565920497857).

Moreover, the [BTC Tracker](https://app.push.org/channels/0x03EAAAa48ea78d1E66eA3458364d553AD981871E) channel surpassed 10,000 subscribers, after witnessing a massive 160% increase in opt-ins between May-August.
