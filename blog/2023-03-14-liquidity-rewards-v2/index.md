Today we are announcing the extension of the Push Liquidity Rewards Program for <b>84 more weeks!</b>ðŸŽŠ

The proposal was brought forth and voted for entirely by the Push community via the [Push DAO](https://twitter.com/Push_DAO). You can read more about the success of the [proposal here](https://snapshot.org/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=RockstarsOfPushWeek17%2618Post#/pushdao.eth/proposal/0x54092053eff30c3c304e45b575881945192e710bc9b3914bfe1d1eadcda3f114).

With the newly enhanced Push Liquidity Rewards Program, weâ€™re incentivizing our community to participate in a range of activities beyond just providing liquidity. For example, receiving additional token rewards for participating in governance. Using these initiatives, we aim to attract more users to the Push platform and create a virtuous cycle of adoption and growth.

In this article, we will discuss the extension and improvements made to the Push Liquidity Rewards Program and its impact to the Push ecosystem.

## Whats new in the rewards program?

With V2 of Push Protocol and the introduction of fee pool staking, $PUSH stakers will now be able to claim fee pool rewards in addition to staking rewards for providing liquidity.

You can find a more detailed breakdown regarding Push Tokenomics and the Push Fee Pool <a href="https://comms.push.org/docs/tokenomics/deepdive/$push/#push-fee-pool"><b>here</b></a>.

This new strategy will improve liquidity rewards at levels above the ones observed during the first iteration of the program.

## Program extension keypoints:

- <b>Duration:</b> 84 weeks
- <b>Start Date:</b> will be announced soon once Push SmartContracts Audit is finished
- <b>Total Rewards:</b> 3,066,100 $PUSH<br/>
  1. Total Amount for UNI LP Pool = <b>1,743,000</b><br/>
  2. Total Amount for PUSH Staking = <b>1,323,100</b>
- <b>Allocated rewards:</b> will decrease for each sequential epoch.
- <b>Reward Distribution:</b> will be distributed at the end of each epoch (21 days), to be shared in % proportion to a userâ€™s contribution to the pool.
- <b>Staking:</b> will only be available through the official <a href="https://app.push.org/#/yield">Push staking portal</a>.

More information surrounding the remaining details is coming soon.

In conclusion, its our goal that by extending and enhancing our liquidity rewards program weâ€™ll better incentivize community engagement and create a more vibrant ecosystem around Push.
