## Overview

Push Protocol recently unveiled Push Nodes, paving way for Push to become blockchain of communication and unleashing a new era for Web3 communication.

With the public launch of Push Nodes getting closer, we are excited to unveil the new economic engine of the [**_`$PUSH`_**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ '$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com') token that will sit at the core of securing, decentralizing and incentiving the Push Network.

## Tokenomics V2 Additions

[**_`$PUSH`_**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ '$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com') is the native token of the Push Network and it will be used to enable several key functions of the network apart from the already existing utilities defined in the [current tokenomics](https://comms.push.org/docs/tokenomics/deepdive/$push/ 'Deepdive on Push Tokenomics').

### 1. Staking for Push Validator Nodes

Push Validator Nodes are going to be the computational backbone of the Push Network. They will be responsible for validating the network and ensuring that the network is secure and reliable. They are also responsible for penalizing and kicking out bad actors from the network.

Running a Push Validator Nodes will require staking a certain amount of [**_`$PUSH`_**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ '$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com') tokens along with having a domain name and a server to run the node.

### 2. Staking for Push Storage Nodes

Push Storage Nodes are meant to store the data of the Push Network. They will be responsible for storing the data of the network and ensuring that the data is available to the network.

Running a Push Storage Nodes will also require staking a certain amount of [**_`$PUSH`_**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ '$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com').

### 3. Staking for Push Delivery Nodes

Push Delivery Nodes serve as a light node that enables the last mile delivery of notifications to the end users. Running them will also have staking requirements.

### 4. Stake for Writing API Calls on Push Node

Having a trustless and decentralized network requires a mechanism to ensure that the network is not spammed with unnecessary API calls. To ensure this, a staking mechanism requiring [**_`$PUSH`_**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ '$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com') will be introduced for writing API calls on the Push Network for sending notifications.

## Exciting Times Ahead

We are excited for the economic engine for Push Network and the new tokenomics V2. The new tokenomics will be a game-changer for the Push ecosystem, and we would love to invite the community for a discussion on the addition of the new tokenomics.

We will be updating the tokenomics page and open a discourse thread for the community to also share their thoughts and feedback soon! Let's Push the boundaries of Web3 together :heart:!
