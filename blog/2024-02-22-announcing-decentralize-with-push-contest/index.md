### About Push Decentralized Nodes

Push Notifications are sent between addresses via the Push Nodes. Push Nodes are the nodes responsible for validating notification and chat payload and for dispatching notifications to addresses. Push Nodes can have different roles in this Communication Network.
The vision for Push Protocol is for the Push Nodes to be run by the community and to get rewarded by contributing to the network's decentralization. As of today, Push Nodes are run by Push Protocol, but the team is working on decentralizing the nodes.
Although the Push Nodes are run by Push Protocol, users can always verify that the chat messages and notifications havenâ€™t been tampered with and that they have indeed been sent by the correct address. Users can always verify this by the Verification Proof.
