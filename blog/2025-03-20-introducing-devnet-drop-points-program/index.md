## Why is Push Chain Awesome?

Push Chain is a shared state blockchain for universal apps, powered by¬†**Chain Abstraction**. It is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain that allows developers to create universal apps and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, and L3s enabling transactions from any chain - any app and any user.

**Push Chain's Superpowers Include:**

- Complete Wallet and Fee Abstraction
- Support for Any Chain Tx (Solana, Eth, EVM, or non-EVM)
- True Scale and Universal Smart Contracts
- Consumer tx (unordered) and Traditional tx (ordered)
- Sub-second finality
