Welcome to another exciting month at Push!

May flew by in the blink of an eye, and we have a whirlwind of exciting updates and achievements to share with you. From groundbreaking developments to valuable partnerships and community activities, the past month has been nothing short of extraordinary.

Get ready to dive in!

## Development

We have been working hard on the development end to bring your Push experience to the next level. The big news of the month is the [upcoming release of Push Protocol v2](https://x.com/PushChain/status/1663910676513816578).

The successful completion of Chainsafe’s security audit for our smart contracts v2 sets the stage for increased robustness and reliability of our platform. The two main features that comprise the v2 launch are <b>Push Fee Pool Staking and Incentivized Chat Requests</b>. Together, these enhancements are enhancing the PUSH token’s utility and enabling new incentivization mechanisms for users. We’re excited about all the developments that will follow. Read all about it in more detail [here](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-protocol-v2-fee-pool-incentivized-chats-launching-in-june-959a3eab4966).

In addition to the v2 developments, we have been making progress on other exciting fronts:

- Simplifying and standardizing SDK functions.
- Launched Push Chat AI, web3’s first chat AI bot.
- Added more test cases and simplified functions on the Push SDK.
